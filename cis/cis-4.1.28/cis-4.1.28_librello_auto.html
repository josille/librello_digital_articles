                              (UA) initiatives can accelerate a sustainability transition of the global food system.
                              It develops the notion of a glocal garden, a large number of likeminded local initiatives
                              with a global impact and forms of worldwide collaboration. Taking a transition perspective,
                              the glocal garden, producing vegetables and fruits, is a niche that has to overcome
                              barriers to compete with the dominant food regime. Since a sustainability transition
                              restructures (policy) sectors, institutional domains including knowledge systems,
                              the paper explores which innovations are needed for the glocal garden to succeed.
                              It discusses the glocal garden as an environmental, a social, an economic and a global
                              project. As an environmental project, the glocal garden will link sustainable production
                              of food with renewable energy production. As a social project, it will be organized
                              into a consumers’ cooperative. As an economic project, it will strive for profit,
                              increasing the yield in a sustainable manner. As a global project, it will enhance
                              collaboration between local cooperatives in the North and the South, as well as with
                              rural agriculture. Under these conditions, the glocal garden can develop into a power,
                              able to resist a possible future food regime that splits societies, in terms of quality
                              standards and food products, into haves and have-nots.

                              <p id="d1e73">Small scale sustainability movements, including the widespread initiatives for urban
                                 agriculture (UA), are considered part of a sustainability transition. One feature
                                 of sustainability transitions is that current large scale activities, i.e. the production
                                 facilities, as well as transnational ownership of production and trade, become challenged
                                 by activities at a much smaller scale. This raises the question as to whether a sustainability
                                 transition of (part of) the global food system can be accelerated by increasing the
                                 share of UA. This question does not imply that, eventually, UA would entirely replace
                                 (large scale) rural agriculture. It does imply that two main features of UA, i.e.
                                 small scale gardening and substantial involvement and ownership by the (nearby) community
                                 who uses the products of the garden, can trigger an acceleration of a sustainability
                                 transition of the current food system.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e75">Asking this question is far from self evident, if only because quite some experts
                                 would  reject the idea as an idealistic fantasy. As former head of FAO Louise Fresco
                                 argues, no matter how appealing it might seem to go back to small scale, farmers markets,
                                 traditional setting and good food, it is a fallacy that comes from a past that we
                                 have forgotten about [<a href="#R01">1</a>]. Rabbinge [<a href="#R02">2</a>] claims that, through technical progress over the last millennium, humankind has
                                 managed to avoid the Malthusian scenario as it can continue to do in the near future.
                                 The increasing world population, from 6.1 billion in 2000 to 8.9 billion in 2050 [<a href="#R03">3</a>], can, as  Rabbinge explains, easily be fed using less land. In his view, a decrease
                                 of agricultural land would mean a decrease of fertilizer and pesticides use, which
                                 is a contribution to sustainable agriculture. From his perspective, a sustainable
                                 agriculture will only be possible with industry producing machines, fertilizers and
                                 pesticides [<a href="#R02">2</a>, <a href="#R04">4</a>]. Fresco shares this view: “Even if a decreasing number of people acknowledge it
                                 today, the application of agricultural and food system science has been one of the
                                 great success stories of mankind, and it has been such a success story because of
                                 the collective capacity of humankind to adjust to the lessons learnt [<a href="#R05">5</a>]”. In all, since the 1960s, world population has doubled while the available calories
                                 per head increased by 25% [<a href="#R05">5</a>, <a href="#R06">6</a>]. The challenge, however, is to double food production in the decades to come, an
                                 increasing part of which for over 3 billion people already living in metropolitan
                                 areas. In her view, this is neither going to happen through farmers markets nor by
                                 relegating millions of farmers, especially in industrializing countries, into poverty.
                                 Instead, Fresco argues, people need affordable and safe food, which requires “smart”
                                 mechanization to compensate for the growing migration from rural to urban areas and
                                 to improve the labor conditions of those still working in agriculture [<a href="#R01">1</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e105">Also from the perspective of community gardeners, exploring the potential of UA to
                                 challenge the food system is not necessarily relevant. In North-America and Europe,
                                 people participating in UA do so with a variety of motives [<a href="#R07">7</a>, <a href="#R08">8</a>, <a href="#R09">9</a>, <a href="#R10">10</a>]. As Veen [<a href="#R10">10</a>] finds for the Netherlands, many people like to garden because they enjoy the act
                                 of gardening and not because they want to change the world or oppose the conventional
                                 food system. Findings with respect to actual motives for engaging in a social movement,
                                 however, have little bearing on the relevance of the question of the movement's potential
                                 for system change. After all, the system impact of peoples' actions is not always
                                 explained by their motives or intentions.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e122">Overall, the urgency of a sustainability transition of the global food system is broadly
                                 recognized. However, different views exist with respect to the main issues the transition
                                 needs to address and its desired direction and goals, even including the very meaning
                                 of the concept `sustainability' itself. Interestingly, UA has always been a worldwide
                                 phenomenon. This paper considers urban agriculture in line with the FAO [<a href="#R11">11</a>] as the growing of plants and the raising of animals within and around cities. However,
                                 to distinguish from private (back)yards, urban agriculture produces some kind of utility
                                 or value shared within a community rather than hedonic pleasure for the private garden
                                 owner only. The value can relate to (substituted) money value, such as from vegetable
                                 crops, food security, seed saving, health, social coherence, the shared pleasure of
                                 gardening, the aesthetics of landscape etc. Therefore, it plays a role in addressing
                                 a variety of issues related to food system transition and can be part of diverging
                                 sustainability scenarios, even if environmental impacts are not under all conditions
                                 found to be positive [<a href="#R12">12</a>]. Many point to the persistent problems in the South, such as local famines, food
                                 scarcity and natural disasters, which are expected to be aggravated by global warming
                                 and extreme weather events. Hence, for industrializing countries UA is being discussed
                                 as an option satisfying the need for food security [<a href="#R11">11</a>, <a href="#R13">13</a>]. Since the 1960s, food security is not the first priority anymore in Europe and
                                 North America. Here, community gardening is practiced under conditions of food abundance
                                 and relative wealth—with an exception for the so-called `food deserts' in US metropolitan
                                 areas [<a href="#R14">14</a>]. For people in industrialized countries, priority issues addressed by UA relate
                                 to the large scale polluting production facilities, the exorbitant power of the retail
                                 sector, monopolies in seed breeding and the disconnectedness between producers and
                                 users.

                              <p id="d1e139">This paper takes into consideration the wide variety of UA initiatives, including
                                 community gardens, market gardens, (rooftop) greenhouses and other forms, as well
                                 as the variety of forms of social organization practiced. Yet, its focus is to identify
                                 and explore under which conditions UA can accelerate a sustainability transition of
                                 the food system worldwide, thereby overcoming allegedly opposed interests between
                                 the North and the South. The paper develops the notion of the `glocal' garden, where
                                 `glocal' refers to a large number of likeminded local initiatives with a global impact
                                 and forms of worldwide collaboration. Starting point is a small-scale initiative with
                                 large involvement and some form of ownership by the local end-users, who are primary
                                 users of the yield. The glocal garden that unfolds is in many respects similar to
                                 many UA projects, but it is primarily an ideal type1: what makes it relevant is its
                                 supposed ability to overcome institutional barriers for environmental, social, economic
                                 and global sustainability. Institutional barriers are usually defined as rules of
                                 the game that shape the behavior of actors. Rules can be formal (like laws and regulations)
                                 but also, sometimes more importantly, informal, like the kinds of knowledge and values
                                 that actors—being companies, organizations or just persons—internalize as to determine
                                 their courses of action in interaction with others. So, the glocal garden that this
                                 paper anticipates has developed institutions of its own that allow it to survive and
                                 strengthen its position vis-á-vis the food system [<a href="#R15">15</a>].

                                 core issues of concern as regards the sustainability of the food system, are not addressed.
                                 This is not meant to imply that the paper would be irrelevant for the food system
                                 at large.

                              <p id="d1e170">Transition theory is about system transformation, i.e. a change in social domains
                                 reflected in technology, economy and institutions [<a href="#R16">16</a>, <a href="#R17">17</a>, <a href="#R18">18</a>, <a href="#R19">19</a>, <a href="#R20">20</a>]. A transition is defined as the shift from a relative stable (sub)system (dynamic
                                 equilibrium) through a period of relatively rapid change in which the system reorganizes
                                 irreversibly into a new (relatively stable) system again [<a href="#R21">21</a>]. Transitions are supposed to take a long time frame (25 years or more), in which
                                 slow and rapid developments take turns. The outcome of a transition, i.e. how a sustainable
                                 food system will look, is uncertain, as actors involved learn during the process.
                                 A transition is always an interplay between multiple actors operating at three levels.
                                 The landscape level is relatively autonomous: developments at this level, such as
                                 international trade agreements, natural disasters, economic crises etc. trigger changes
                                 in the food system. The food system is featured by a regime, which is defined by the
                                 dominant institutions and the powers that be. At the niche level, activities and actors
                                 emerge, which are in one way or another opposed to the regime and may benefit from
                                 destabilizing developments at landscape level.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e191">The regime this paper addresses is the worldwide food system, which includes all actors
                                 who are in some way involved in the production, (global) trade, retail and sales of
                                 food and feed. As Friedmann [<a href="#R22">22</a>] points out, a global food regime first emerged as an international wheat regime
                                 in the 19th century. This regime, built on the idea of `free trade', collapsed during
                                 the 1930s depression. Following World War 2, a regime emerged, which Friedmann labels
                                 the Mercantile-Industrial food regime. This regime was based on subsidies, import
                                 restrictions and, where developing countries are concerned, on subsidized exports
                                 or `aid'. This regime began to show cracks during the 1070s because of the rivalry
                                 between European and American food exports and the failure of the `green revolution'
                                 in Africa. Friedmann speculates about the direction of what could be labeled as an
                                 emerging Corporate-Environmental food regime. Drawing on Lang and Heasman [<a href="#R23">23</a>] she identifies two competing paradigms. One anticipates a continuation of the industrial
                                 regime using advanced science for large manufacturing of (new) food products. The
                                 other builds on small scale ecological production. One salient feature of the food
                                 regime in the neo-liberal era is the increased power of the retail sector in setting
                                 food quality standards beyond those prescribed by public agencies, a trend largely
                                 encouraged by the policy catastrophe in the UK around the BSE scare in the 1990s,
                                 when supermarkets started to guarantee the safety of beef, while British government
                                 was paralyzed [<a href="#R24">24</a>].  Friedmann notices that these standard levels (will) have an immediate impact on
                                 the diet offered to the higher and lower income groups.

                              <p id="d1e202">UA, in its broad variety of forms [<a href="#R12">12</a>] is the typical niche in the food system. Niches struggle in order to become (part
                                 of the) regime, which means that behavior, technology, infrastructure and institutions
                                 at large will have to change in favor of the niche(s). Not surprisingly, niches are
                                 opposite to regimes in that they are not (yet) institutionalized, whereas regimes
                                 by definition are. However, niches are not opposing the regime in all respects and
                                 they may also be as different among themselves as they are from the regime [<a href="#R25">25</a>]. To illustrate, organic farming contrasts the food regime as regards principles
                                 and methods of farming, but it is not necessarily different where sales and business
                                 model are concerned. An urban farm is probably very different where the relationship
                                 with its clientele (local community) is concerned. Also in terms of business model,
                                 an urban farm is different from a conventional rural farm.

                                 governmental and non-governmental agencies in multi-domains (interactions between

                                 multiple disciplines. For a good understanding of the far reaching impact of system
                                 change for the food system, it is critical to focus on the interaction between different
                                 domains. A sustainability transition has to overcome physical and social cleavages
                                 that are reproduced in current unsustainable practices and, in a sense, help in reproducing
                                 these. It may be hard to imagine, but in the `end' domains or separate systems that

                                 in a completely new way. In the context of the perspectives for UA we may think of
                                 the following cleavages to be overcome:

                              <p id="d1e305">Unless agricultural land is used for industrial agriculture or mono-crops that hinder
                                 biodiversity, peri-urban landscape is enjoyed by many for recreational and health
                                 purposes. Functions, such as protection of biodiversity and small-scale recreation,
                                 can, at least in many European countries where subsidies are available, add to the
                                 farmers' income. For UA these functions are obvious, especially the landscape aspects
                                 of a garden in a vibrant city. This means that UA as an environmental project will
                                 abstain from the use of agro-chemicals and will try to minimize energy and water consumption.
                                 However, there is more to say about the glocal garden as an environmental project.

                              <p id="d1e307">An important synergy for agriculture in an urban context is the production of renewable
                                 energy. This is especially important in countries that suffer from regular electricity
                                 fall-outs. For cities and towns with a moderate climate, which have a large demand
                                 for heat, the concept of the `greenhouse village' is interesting. For areas with a
                                 warm climate, but with large temperature differences between day and night or another
                                 natural cooling source available (the sea), the notion underlying the greenhouse village
                                 concept may serve for sustainable cooling. This concept [<a href="#R27">27</a>] links agricultural production in greenhouses to the demand for heat in households.
                                 During summer, a greenhouse receives far more heat from the sun than it needs over
                                 the year. The excess heat can be harvested and stored in underground aquifers to be
                                 used in winter (aquifer thermal energy storage -ATES). The surplus can be delivered
                                 to the nearby neighborhood. Through digestion of black water from households' toilets,
                                 kitchen waste and biowaste from the greenhouse in an anaerobic high pressure digester
                                 adjacent to the greenhouse, gas is produced [<a href="#R28">28</a>]. This can be used for power generation (electricity) and tap water heating. The
                                 remaining CO2 and the waste water can be reused as fertilizer in the greenhouse.

                              <p id="d1e315">This cradle to cradle option has not been realized in practice, but it offers future
                                 possibilities, as also recognized by Fresco ([<a href="#R05">5</a>], p. 381). One of the implementation problems is that it challenges the dominant
                                 knowledge framework as regards energy saving and heat provision and gives rise to
                                 knowledge conflict [<a href="#R29">29</a>]. The option supposes a radical shift in heating from the `normal' way, with heat
                                 distribution systems that handle so-called low value heat (up to 90C∘), to a system
                                 that provides Very Low Value Heat (about 35C∘). Distributing systems for very low
                                 temperature heating (or high temperature cooling) find their way to the market slowly,
                                 meeting with resistance, where natural gas is the common heat source. The example
                                 of the Greenhouse Village is powerful as it shows how energy and food production can
                                 be combined though technologies that are not very complex and accessible for SMEs.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e323">A second option that illustrates a possibility of integrating food and energy is known
                                 under the name `Terra Preta' or Very Black Earth. This earth has been found in Amazonia
                                 and parts of Western Africa and goes back to 2500 BC. The native farmers have improved
                                 the soil by regularly adding charcoal to it [<a href="#R30">30</a>]. Charcoal is produced from locally available biomass. Through pyrolysis (combustion
                                 without oxygen at relatively low temperatures) the biomass is split in an oil (or
                                 gas) and a carbon fraction. Storing the carbon underground enriches the soil and increases
                                 the harvest. Another advantage for local farmers is that the oily fraction can be
                                 used for electricity generation at local level. This offers a local energy solution
                                 for (remote) areas not connected to a (vulnerable) grid. These qualities make underground
                                 carbon storage a much better idea for addressing CO2 emissions than underground storage
                                 of CO2 [<a href="#R31">31</a>]. For industrializing countries in particular, this option might provide communities
                                 with energy as well as additional income [<a href="#R32">32</a>]. Since the carbon stored is provided by biomass instead of fossil fuels, this option
                                 has the potential of leading to a negative carbon balance. Since it is cheaper than
                                 CO2 storage [<a href="#R32">32</a>], transnational energy companies could benefit if they transfer carbon credits to
                                 UA cooperatives in developing countries [<a href="#R33">33</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e340">The Terra Preta option illustrates that for UA boundaries between expert knowledge
                                 and knowledge in practice, between knowledge production and application become blurred.
                                 The knowledge on Terra Preta existed long before academic knowledge became standard
                                 [<a href="#R34">34</a>]. Knowledge on the benefits of carbon storage spread over the world since humankind
                                 started with agriculture in an era when physical distances could not be overcome with
                                 modern means of communication. Still, hobby gardeners all over the world know that
                                 carbon may improve the soil, although it is uncertain if this works for every soil
                                 type.

                              <p id="d1e345">In conclusion, this section illustrates that the glocal garden can benefit from innovations
                                 that produce synergies between the urban and the rural, between agriculture, energy,
                                 waste, water and soil and that this is good for the environment. Another issue is
                                 that such synergies are beneficial for the finances that the urban farmers may need
                                 to provide their enterprise with a stable economic prospect.

                              <p id="d1e350">The main barrier for the glocal garden as a social project has been identified by
                                 Hardin [<a href="#R35">35</a>]  as the Tragedy of the Commons. The metaphor is the common pasture that in the end
                                 will suffer from overgrazing, as the farmers will do their best to get all benefits
                                 from the common land and will not invest in its maintenance. Drawing on this metaphor,
                                 modern people will do their own thing first and neglect or postpone their obligations
                                 as regards the community garden. Olson [<a href="#R36">36</a>] had already referred to this phenomenon as the `logic of collective action'. The
                                 main argument is that a rational individual will take a free ride when it comes to
                                 realizing or protecting a public good, i.e. a good that is accessible to all and from
                                 which no-one can be excluded (clean air, landscape view, peace etc.). The main driver
                                 for rational individual behaviour is not, as is often assumed, selfishness, but in
                                 Olson's words, that a person's individual contribution would not be perceptible ([<a href="#R36">36</a>], p. 64). Olson argues that rational individuals want to contribute to a public good
                                 under two conditions only: (1) when there is coercion (government regulation and enforcement)
                                 or (2) when those who participate are provided with selective benefits.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e361">Modern policy analysts argue that theories and metaphors like the logic of collective
                                 action and the tragedy of the commons are outdated. New institutionalists, like Ostrom
                                 [<a href="#R37">37</a>], have shown that groups are perfectly able to enforce mutual agreement on sustainable
                                 behaviour, such as fishermen protecting their fish stock. There are many examples
                                 of successful collective action, including citizens cooperatives for UA, which suggest
                                 that Olson and allies were wrong. Before jumping to conclusions on the social conditions
                                 for a glocal garden four issues need careful attention: (1) group size, (2) the degree
                                 of consensus on the values associated with selective benefits and (3) empowerment,
                                 control and trust.

                                    <p id="d1e369">According to Olson's theory people are expected not to voluntarily protect public
                                       goods, especially if the public good relates to the interest of the largest possible
                                       group. In contrast, small groups are much more likely to succeed in promoting their
                                       interests. The large majority with an interest in peace is less well organized than
                                       the small group that at times has an interest in war ([<a href="#R36">36</a>], p. 166). Therefore, the large group not only provides evidence for Olson's thesis,
                                       “they also suffer if it is true” ([<a href="#R36">36</a>], p. 167).
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e377">The idea that small groups are more effective in promoting their interests than large
                                       groups can also be found in the literature on the so-called Not-In-My-Back-Yard (NIMBY)
                                       syndrom [<a href="#R38">38</a>, <a href="#R39">39</a>], which explains local opposition in case of locally unwanted land uses (LULUs).
                                       Unwanted land uses benefit the large group, including people living far away, whereas
                                       the costs (burdens) are for the local community in their immediate vicinity. Hence,
                                       the per capita costs motivating people to resist the LULU are much higher than the
                                       per capita benefits that motivate people to realize it. This explains why NIBVMY resistance
                                       is often successful [<a href="#R40">40</a>]. The remedy proposed is to provide locals with selective benefits, i.e. compensation
                                       or even reward, in exchange for acceptance. This approach is supposed to lose effectiveness,
                                       once values are at stake that cannot, according to those involved, be framed in monetary
                                       terms, such as health and safety.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e388">So, the logic of collective action and concepts similar in that they are all based
                                       on economic rationality, support the idea that small groups are in a fairly good position
                                       to realize and maintain a public good, like a community garden, whereas a large group
                                       would probably fail. An (implicit) assumption behind the logic of collective action
                                       is that people act in social isolation, like in the prisoner's dilemma [<a href="#R38">38</a>]. In reality, however, individuals act in accordance with their personal level of
                                       attachment to social norms [<a href="#R39">39</a>]. This is especially the case for small groups, where people are likely to know each
                                       other and where social control may serve as an incentive for engagement.

                                    <p id="d1e399">Yet another factor relevant for both success and failure of the glocal garden as a
                                       social project relates to the different types of selective benefits offered to the
                                       people involved. Many of these are in kind, like vegetables and flowers from the garden,
                                       but also of a non-material nature. Many urban farms started as community projects
                                       such as after school programs or educational centers for inner-city kids. People might
                                       very well experience the act of gardening or the opportunity to establish friendly
                                       relationships with others via the community garden as social benefits. Several students
                                       of community projects find that the need for social cohesion is a very important driver
                                       for people to engage [<a href="#R43">43</a>].
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e404">However, the social act of gardening together with neighbours, which according to
                                       many makes a strong case for UA in a local community context, may also signify its
                                       vulnerability. After all, many people don't like gardening, many even dislike it,
                                       as it is at times dirty and very hard work. People may simply want to spend their
                                       time in a different way, for example, undertaking activities with their families and
                                       friends. Many would not care so much about the new social relationships offered, as
                                       they already lack the time to maintain their current ones. They may take care of their
                                       own garden or allotment garden first, before spending time in the community garden.
                                       Hence, there is reason to believe that these people, probably a large majority, are
                                       unlikely to either engage in an urban farming project or to persevere with their contribution
                                       in the long run. This has to do with the observation that the values at stake with
                                       a public good, like an urban farming project, are not the same for everyone ([<a href="#R36">36</a>], p. 60). Dissent on the values related to the public good in everyday life undermines
                                       the glocal garden as a social project.

                                       between producers, wholesale, retail, investors and consumers. Consumers of food may
                                       (re)gain control over (part of) their food through a local cooperative, an inclusive

                                    <p id="d1e414">Agriculture cooperatives are not at all a new phenomenon. In the late 19th century,
                                       several countries witnessed initiatives to form producer cooperatives with the aim
                                       of getting a fair price for vegetables, flowers and fruits through local auctions.
                                       Auctions replaced the by then intransparant networks through which vegetables and
                                       fruits were brought to the (consumer) markets [<a href="#R44">44</a>, <a href="#R45">45</a>]. According to Tourte and Gaskell [<a href="#R46">46</a>] the Netherlands in particular faced a spectacular number of cooperative auctions.
                                       Although the economic reasons for agriculture cooperatives were quite compelling,
                                       there were many obstacles to overcome. Auctions suffered from their members' unwillingness
                                       to bring their apples and pears to the auction [<a href="#R47">47</a>]. The real breakthrough came in 1916, when the Dutch government ruled that vegetables
                                       and fruits had to go through an auction, preventing exports of Dutch produce to countries
                                       involved in the war, where demand for fresh products was high. When government coercion
                                       was lifted after the war, fruit growers in several provinces turned back to the old
                                       practice. Tourte and Gaskell [<a href="#R46">46</a>] refer to other examples of hesitations to voluntarily offer products to the auction
                                       and the decisive impact of state intervention in the Netherlands and Japan. In countries
                                       like the United States, cooperatives appear to have been more effective without state
                                       intervention. However, as Tourte and Gaskell [<a href="#R46">46</a>] state, the history of producer cooperatives has not been very well documented.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e435">The case of cooperative auctions shows a nice example of a prisoner's dilemma or tragedy
                                       of the commons, even among relatively small local groups. In spite of a joint interest
                                       in advancing their sales through cooperative auctions, producers showed lack of trust
                                       in the new institution. Quite a number of social theories would lead to conclude that
                                       especially small, informal, homogeneous groups are effective in building trust, as
                                       these are able to reinforce normative sanctions  [<a href="#R48">48</a>, <a href="#R49">49</a>]. However, there is no evidence that local initiatives for urban farming are a panacea
                                       for lack of trust. To the contrary, people who know each other personally may also
                                       know whom to trust or not.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e443">Still, the UA cooperative, where consumers enact control over the production of their
                                       food, is to be considered a major institutional innovation. What is new is that the
                                       enterprise is owned by consumers rather than producers, that consumers become investors
                                       and share in the eventual profits of the undertaking. Being a legal entity, a cooperative
                                       can also work on building relationships of trust in the community by explicit and
                                       transparent rules of the game that can be controlled by its membership (cf. [<a href="#R37">37</a>]). According to Tilly, who has contributed much to the foundation of resource mobilization
                                       theory, political rights and political opportunity rather than prospects for financial
                                       gain help a social movement to gain momentum. Interestingly, Tilly [<a href="#R50">50</a>] found this a decisive element in a comparative case study on food riots in the medieval
                                       era and early modernity. The major relevance of the UA cooperative is not so much
                                       that it is an enterprise, but that it may become a vehicle to reduce distances between
                                       producers, consumers and investors and, as such, contribute to a different (circular
                                       kind of) economy [<a href="#R51">51</a>].

                                    <p id="d1e454">To conclude, with respect to the glocal garden as a social project, its main challenge
                                       to overcome is the tragedy of the commons; many like the idea of urban farming but
                                       most do not sufficiently contribute to make it happen or to keep it going. Indeed,
                                       the project must be local and small-scale as to enable for sufficient social benefits.
                                       A cooperative enterprise is essential for the glocal garden as a social project, because,
                                       next to a variety of (material and non-material) benefits, it provides empowerment
                                       and control.

                              <p id="d1e459">To address the economics of the glocal garden touches upon a sensitive issue. Many
                                 community projects related to UA are buttressed by volunteers and are not aimed at
                                 making profit. There are also internationally operating, profit seeking companies
                                 who specialize in (high tech) UA, but have little or no connection with local communities.
                                 There is a belief among scholars of social innovation and sustainable business models
                                 that sustainable enterprise is—and perhaps should be—primarily interested in generating
                                 ecological and social values and in last instance only a `moderate' profit at most
                                 [<a href="#R52">52</a>, <a href="#R53">53</a>]. Without having any problems with voluntary community projects, economic viability
                                 becomes an issue once the glocal garden is to become a challenge for the worldwide
                                 food regime. The garden needs protection, if only against urban land owners, developers
                                 and planners who may want to arrange for new activities on the garden land. The garden
                                 may need money to buy the land in order to safeguard it for future speculations by
                                 the land owner and local government. There are many more reasons for an UA project
                                 to make a profit. Perhaps more importantly, there is no compelling reason to deny
                                 a sustainable enterprise the right of making a profit.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e467">Whereas the glocal garden must remain relatively small in order to meet its social
                                 challenges, from the point of view of economics this does not look like a reasonable
                                 request. After all, the global trend in agriculture, including the production of vegetables
                                 and fruits, is towards large scale farming, higher efficiency, producing more with
                                 less people and less space. Hence, the major challenge from an economic point of view
                                 is to remain small and, at the same time, realize some economic (financial) benefits.
                                 There is reason to believe that this is very well possible.

                              <p id="d1e469">Firstly, economic prospects relate to the way local involvement and ownership areorganized.
                                 When the consumers are simultaneously investors in the cooperative, their money stays
                                 in the local community. For a sustainability project such as UA, consumers are willing
                                 to accept a margin much lower than a professional investment company or bank.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e471">Second, an end user cooperative with a local base can afford to offer the products
                                 to customers without intervention from wholesale or retail. This saves a lot of money.
                                 Van der Noll et al. ([<a href="#R54">54</a>], p. iii) distinguish the following breakdown costs in the Dutch consumer price:
                                 (1) price for producer, (2) retail (package, logistics, transport and storage), (3)
                                 gross margin supermarket and (4) VAT. The breakdown is given for a typical Dutch product,
                                 the greenhouse paprika. For each euro received by the producer in a specific week
                                 the consumer paid €2.63 in the supermarket, i.e. a difference of over 60%. Without
                                 arguing about the average figures it would not be unreasonable to assume price differences
                                 over 50%. Since the (European) retail sector has producer contracts all over the world,
                                 the prices paid to small producers in eg. Kenya are probably not higher than those
                                 paid to Dutch producers. Up scaling in professional horticulture is to a large extent
                                 caused by the pressure on the farmer to raise efficiency and production, as buyer
                                 competition in the market has dropped under the growing power of an oligopolistic
                                 retail sector [<a href="#R22">22</a>]. According to a leader of a Dutch farmers union, this trend is causing the collapse
                                 of the food system [<a href="#R55">55</a>].  Avoiding wholesale and retail will not only lead to cost savings for the benefit
                                 of the cooperative, it is also an important disincentive to go for large scale farming.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e482">Third: when it comes to costs and benefits, another issue is as to whether a small
                                 garden (even a few hundred square meter) can realize an economically acceptable amount
                                 of produce, especially if the garden wants to avoid the use of pesticides. It may
                                 be no surprise that estimations vary considerably, but many are quite optimistic.
                                 According to FAO [<a href="#R11">11</a>], garden plots can be up to 15 times more productive than rural holdings. An area
                                 of just one square meter can provide 20 kg of food a year. Especially for industrializing
                                 countries, the potential of UA for food security appears beyond dispute [<a href="#R56">56</a>]. Also for industrialized countries there are optimistic reports. Japanese UA is
                                 more productive than its rural counterparts. According to government 2010 data, urban
                                 fields are the most productive kind of agriculture in terms of economic value of production
                                 per area—3% more productive than the national average [<a href="#R57">57</a>]. An estimate for London [<a href="#R58">58</a>] assumes a productivity level of over 10 kg per m2. Bellows, Brown and Smit [<a href="#R59">59</a>] state that a 100 m2 garden in a temperate 130 days growing season can produce most
                                 of a household's vegetable needs, including the nutritional requirements for vitamin
                                 A, B and C complex and iron. However, in so far as actual output is concerned, much
                                 lower figures are reported for the USA [<a href="#R60">60</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e503">All in all, these figures are not conclusive, but what adds to the optimism is the
                                 trend, especially in North America, of small-scale commercial urban farming among
                                 young entrepreneurs [<a href="#R60">60</a>]. A well-known example is Le Jardin de la Grelinette in St Armand, Quebec, Canada.
                                 The farmer, Fortier [<a href="#R61">61</a>] describes in some detail how he manages to do intensive organic farming on a piece
                                 of ca 1 ha and make a living out of it. One important way to increase efficiency has
                                 been the development of tools that apply to small-scale farming. Another important
                                 strategy, found among urban farming projects to raise financial output is to diversify
                                 their produce. Urban farms can grow several varieties of one kind, with different
                                 shapes, forms and colors, including so-called `forgotten' vegetables and fruits. Many
                                 of these are not available in the regular food store but they are attractive for customers
                                 interested in good food. For the near future, linking urban food production with the
                                 production of energy may also add to the economic prospects of the glocal garden.
                                 
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e511">An additional positive effect of the glocal garden, run as a for-profit company, would
                                 be its contribution to employment. Worldwide, small and medium sized companies (SME)
                                 are estimated to give a major contribution to GNP, about 60–70% [59]. Although wages
                                 might not be exorbitant, concern with respect to labor conditions in agriculture may
                                 not apply for the glocal garden, since many of the personnel will probably be co-owning
                                 the enterprise. According to ILO ([<a href="#R62">62</a>], p. 25), job satisfaction tends to be higher for employees of SMEs. This may be
                                 related to factors such as greater work autonomy and a lower degree of division of
                                 labor.

                              <p id="d1e519">Realizing an impressive yield/ha is one thing, challenging the world food system is
                                 another. For this to happen, the glocal garden would have to make a significant contribution
                                 to world food security. It is beyond the scope of this paper to quantify what significant
                                 would mean, but clearly it would be more than a small niche.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e521">There are various reasons to question a significant UA contribution to meet the worldwide
                                 demand for fruits and vegetables. It can be argued that there will not be sufficient
                                 physical space in urban areas to get the amount of (sustainable) produce needed to
                                 feed the urban people. This argument can be supported by observations related to the
                                 available space in urban areas worldwide today, which has been estimated at one third
                                 of the total global urban area [<a href="#R63">63</a>]. This estimate does not take into account the number of local circumstances that
                                 would in practice prevent UA projects to take off, including ownership, urban planning,
                                 soil conditions etc. The glocal garden would have to resist the global urbanization
                                 trend, demanding more land for developing settlements, industry, and infrastructure.
                                 Also from a sustainability perspective a significant contribution from UA is not evident.
                                 In mainstream thinking, `biological' or `organic' farming produces less than conventional
                                 farming. With these sustainable farming methods, feeding an increasing world population
                                 would require even more land, which would further diminish rainforest and other valuable
                                 ecosystems on the planet. From a sustainability point of view this would be unacceptable.
                                 Instead, even if UA could make a contribution, sustainable farming would imply producing
                                 more with less land and less people.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e526">Several observations refute mainstream thinking. First, the physical space practically
                                 available over time is far from static, which is, ironically, due to the global urbanization
                                 trend itself. Turning more rural agricultural land and nature into metropolitan urban
                                 areas will at the same time create `empty' spaces where green projects can flourish.
                                 Second, the trend towards urbanization triggers more demand for urban green. The UN
                                 and several member states have already defined standards, as  not yet legally binding,
                                 for the amount of green space per urban inhabitant [<a href="#R64">64</a>]. Considerations related to health and labor productivity provide an incentive for
                                 companies, citizens and urban planners to allocate more green space. Third, where
                                 in the 20th century (urban) planning was still dominated by the idea of competition
                                 and separation between functions, including agriculture and nature, or agriculture
                                 and recreation, today's mood is more towards integration, creating a so-called win-win.
                                 If rural agriculture would be sustainable in that the quality of the soil and its
                                 ecosystems are preserved, there is much less need to decrease the share of agricultural
                                 land. The same is true for UA, which potentially combines many positive functions
                                 of urban green. Hence, sustainability requirements in metropolitan areas will encourage
                                 that more urban space will be allocated for gardening, not only on land but also on
                                 rooftops, along walls etc. This will considerably increase (peri)urban landscape quality.
                                 It is however obvious that the (re)conquering of green space will not go without heavy
                                 political conflicts. The glocal garden stands a chance to overcome, if it is based
                                 on community involvement and ownership and if it adds economic value to the local
                                 area.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e531">A fourth observation is that UA has always been and still is quite significant in
                                 volume.  World War I and II witnessed a peoples' movement, largely stimulated by the
                                 respective governments, to maintain so-called Victory Gardens in Canada,  United Kingdom,
                                 United States, Australia and other countries [<a href="#R65">65</a>, <a href="#R66">66</a>, <a href="#R67">67</a>].  The production of food was vital for winning the war. People used their back-yards
                                 but also public places to produce vegetables and fruits. The US Department of Agriculture
                                 estimated that more than 20 million victory gardens were planted. By 1944, fruit and
                                 vegetables harvested in these home and community plots was estimated to be 9–10 million
                                 tons, an amount equal to all commercial production of fresh vegetables in the USA.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e542">Today, some estimates say that 15–20% of the world’s food is already grown in urban
                                 areas [<a href="#R68">68</a>]. Especially in poor metropolitan areas in Bangladesh, Vietnam, Nepal, Malawi and
                                 Guatemala between 40% and 80% of the population is participating in UA activities
                                 [<a href="#R69">69</a>]. In Japan, almost one-third of all agricultural output in the country is generated
                                 by UA. Urban farmers account for 25% of farming households in Japan [<a href="#R57">57</a>]. Even if the figures on the actual share of UA to the world supply of vegetables
                                 and fruits proved incorrect, the actual number of initiatives worldwide is impressive.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e553">If the local gardens together would indeed be able to increase their production in
                                 that it would be significant enough to challenge the global food regime, there is
                                 still one element to be added in order to become a global project. Glocal gardens
                                 could really become global in character if they would start working together. Cooperation
                                 could take place at a bilateral or multilateral level, in informal networks sharing
                                 knowledge and skills. Cooperatives could constitute a lobby for political attention
                                 and for mutual support in their struggles with local developers and policy planners.
                                 They could help each other with loans for investments. Perhaps cooperatives in the
                                 North and the South could increase their attractiveness vis-à-vis their membership,
                                 joining forces and trading products that certain cooperatives cannot grow themselves
                                 given climate conditions. There are many examples of fruits and vegetables that can
                                 ripen during long distance transportation by ship, which is not necessarily unsustainable.
                                 Such collaboration may bring additional financial benefits and would strengthen cooperatives'
                                 competitiveness vis-à-vis the retail sector. Other forms of collaboration could be
                                 considered as well, such as sustainable tourism. Small-scale agriculture projects
                                 do not need expensive certification systems to convince their supporters with respect
                                 to the sustainability of the partner far away, there are sufficient online communication
                                 techniques to keep informed in a transparent manner. UA cooperatives may further be
                                 tempted to seek collaboration with SMEs in different sectors of rural agriculture.
                                 At this point, when (in)formal collaboration is established, institutions emerge with
                                 the potential of challenging the global food system.

                              <p id="d1e558">This paper has set out to explore the conditions needed for UA to make a difference
                                 in accelerating a sustainability transition of the global food system, taking into
                                 account interests of urban farming in both the North and the South. Obviously, there
                                 are currently many views on the physical potential of UA within the food system as
                                 well as the drivers and motives for people engaging in urban farming initiatives.
                                 There are also critical assessments with respect to the sustainability of UA. In developing
                                 the notion of a glocal garden, which can trigger an acceleration of a food system
                                 transition, this paper takes stock from some of these, neglecting others. In that
                                 sense, this paper is biased toward possible trajectories for a food system sustainability
                                 transition. The conditions discussed relate to innovations at the intersection of
                                 sectors and fields that are currently still considered separately.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e560">For the glocal garden as an environmental project, the paper discussed innovations
                                 in the knowledge system where new linkages are developed for food-energy-water-soil
                                 and waste. Environmentally sound innovations contribute to financial stability of
                                 the glocal garden. For addressing the vulnerability of the glocal garden as a social
                                 project, the social innovation proposed is the consumer cooperative that provides
                                 its membership with selective benefits, including financial gain. The glocal garden
                                 as an economic project will benefit from innovations that enable intensive farming,
                                 striving for the highest yield in a sustainable manner. As a global project, UA already
                                 makes a considerable contribution to the worldwide demand for vegetables and fruits.
                                 Given autonomous developments, including the global trend towards urbanization, an
                                 even greater share can be foreseen for the near future. Collaboration between cooperatives
                                 around the globe, between the North and the South in particular, as well as developing
                                 (new) forms of collaboration with rural agriculture will be a necessary and decisive
                                 step in accelerating the transition.

                              <p id="d1e562">This paper does not at all deny or ignore the variety of interests, motives and concerns
                                 that underlie decisions by millions of people, each day, to participate in UA projects
                                 worldwide. It also recognizes the importance of a pluralist approach that enables
                                 people to take their share. Interestingly, however, a system's transition is in the
                                 end not only dependent on individual drivers. Instead, the awareness of participants
                                 is shaped by the many (contradictory) tendencies today, some of which work in the
                                 advantage of the here presented view, whereas others do not. There is a growing dissatisfaction
                                 with neoliberal practices, large scale production and the interminable gap between
                                 investors, producers and consumers. There is an increasing interest in sustainability,
                                 in good and healthy food, locally produced, as well as in diversification including
                                 varieties of so-called `forgotten' vegetables. More importantly, however, for an increasing
                                 part of the world the major concern is (still) fresh food availability. There is obviously
                                 no guarantee what the (virtual) end point of a transition in the food system will
                                 be. It is very well possible that an emerging food regime will, in terms of quality
                                 standards and products, split societies into the haves and the have-nots. Yet, what
                                 makes the glocal garden so interesting to explore from a system perspective, is exactly
                                 that it has the potential of countering such development. After all, gardening is
                                 traditionally for people from all social, ethnic and cultural backgrounds.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e564">From the perspective of governance, too, the glocal garden is an interesting case.
                                 This is because, in contrast to the energy transition in many countries, UA is an
                                 issue primarily dealt with at local level. The glocal garden will face both resistance
                                 and opportunities that it must deal with by confronting local policy-makers and urban
                                 planners. Without doubt, the interests of land owners, developers and builders transcend
                                 in many cases local community and municipality borders, which makes them powerful
                                 as well as vulnerable.   Instead, small local groups have an advantage in successfully
                                 promoting their interests, which is favorable for the glocal garden.

                                          has increased more with a decreasing number of farmers [2]. Whereas in the Middle
                                          Ages one hectare could produce 1000 kg of grains, by the start of the 21st century
                                          the farmers in North Western Europe were able to produce 8000 kg wheat per ha with
                                          much less labor than ever before. This increase is considered possible for many parts
                                          of the world. Currently, the EU uses 127 million hectare for the production of food
                                          crops. Basically, a more efficient agriculture would have to exploit at most 92 million
