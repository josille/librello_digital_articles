                  <p class="first" id="d1e171">This article reports evidence for substantial public support for the large-scale deployment
                     of three renewable energy options in Kenya: wind, solar PV, and geothermal energy.
                     With these renewable technologies, the government of Kenya could make a large contribution
                     to reaching its national commitment under the Paris Agreement. Prices, infrastructural
                     needs, and land-use requirements importantly contribute to shaping public opinion
                     about these renewable energy alternatives, in different ways and directions for wind,
                     PV, and geothermal energy. While overall the evaluation of these technologies is positive,
                     public authorities should be wary of the possible inconveniences and drawbacks associated
                     with them. Anticipating and, where possible, mitigating these shortcomings in national
                     climate and energy development plans could preclude some of them becoming possible
                     hindrances for broad-scale adoption of wind, PV, and geothermal energy. Furthering
                     quantitative public acceptance studies, like the one presented here based on (semi-)expert
                     elicitation and information-choice questionnaires, can assist in Kenya fully reaching
                     its national climate and energy ambitions. More generally, we argue that the establishment
                     of affordable, clean, and secure energy systems, as well as the mitigation of global
                     climate change, can benefit from stakeholder engagement and public survey analysis
                     like the one performed in our study â in developing countries as much as in the developed
                     part of the world.

            <p id="d1e190">Climate change is one of the largest challenges facing mankind this century, and transforming
               our global economy according to universal principles of sustainable development is
               top priority on the political agenda of the international community [<a href="#R1">1</a>]. Particularly important is supporting countries in the worldâs developing regions
               to combine persistent economic growth with efforts to mitigate emissions of gases
               that cause global warming. The establishment of energy transition pathways, in which
               fossil fuels are gradually replaced with low-carbon energy options, is assisted by
               energy systems modelling exercises in which alternative transformation scenarios are
               quantified, analysed, and compared [<a href="#R2">2</a>].While these modelling efforts have thus far mostly focused on developed countries,
               a few similar studies have been undertaken for developing countries recently (see
               e.g. Altieri <i>et al.</i>, 2016 [<a href="#R3">3</a>]; Taliotis <i>et al.</i>, 2016 [<a href="#R4">4</a>]; Lucas <i>et al.</i>, 2017 [<a href="#R5">5</a>]; van der Zwaan <i>et al.</i>, 2018 [<a href="#R6">6</a>]).
            </p>
            <p id="d1e223">To advance studies in the field of energy transition pathways in the developing world,
               we focus in this paper on an important African country, Kenya. Socio-scientific studies
               on the deployment of low-carbon and/or renewable forms of energy importantly complement
               energy and climate scenario modelling work. A relatively large number of studies have
               been performed that investigate the role of public or expert opinions on energy system
               transformation pathways or individual innovative energy technologies in developed
               countries (see e.g. de Best-Waldhober <i>et al.</i>, 2012 [<a href="#R7">7</a>]; Baker <i>et al.</i>, 2015 [<a href="#R8">8</a>]).Only few studies have so far been undertaken on public opinion with regards to
               energy and climate change issues in Africa (a few examples are Camblong <i>et al.</i>, 2009 on Senegal [<a href="#R9">9</a>]; Wetangâula, 2010 on Kenya [<a href="#R10">10</a>]; Ondraczek, 2011 on Kenya and Tanzania [<a href="#R11">11</a>]; Bouzidi, 2011 on Algeria [<a href="#R12">12</a>]; and Hanger <i>et al.</i>, 2016 on Morocco [<a href="#R13">13</a>]). We think that this paucity should urgently be rectified, given the importance
               of swiftly deploying renewable energy technologies in Africa on a large scale and
               of the role of public acceptance issues therein. The present paper attempts to make
               a step in that direction by presenting a (semi-)expert elicitation based case study
               on public attitudes towards renewable energy in Kenya.

            <p id="d1e259">Our approach aims to characterise attitudes of participants towards three different
               renewable energy technologiesâwind, PV, and geothermal energyâbased on their responses
               to objective information we provided on the possible impacts of these technologies.
               Participants are informed that each of these three renewable energy technologies may
               be able to contribute to solving global climate change. But participants are also
               provided with the possible consequences associated with the use and/or deployment
               of these energy options, on the basis of which they are asked to express their reactions.
               Our study presents a first application of this (semi-)expert public opinion survey
               method to analyse the acceptance of renewable energy technologies in Kenya, and to
               assess how objective information can contribute to shaping public opinion among Kenyans.
               Below, in section 2, we first review Kenyaâs ambitions under the Paris Agreement.
               In section 3 we describe the survey method used for our research. In section 4 we
               present our main results, while in section 5 we discuss some of our main insights.
               In section 6 we formulate several main conclusions and make a few recommendations

            <p id="d1e264">Under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Paris Agreement,
               concluded in 2015 and ratified a year later [<a href="#R14">14</a>], the Kenyan Government has obliged itself to a ânationally determined contributionâ
               (NDC) of reducing domestic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 30% in 2030 in comparison
               to a business-as-usual scenario [<a href="#R15">15</a>, <a href="#R16">16</a>]. Using the countryâs renewable energy resources appears essential to meet this goal
               [<a href="#R17">17</a>, <a href="#R18">18</a>].Whether indeed renewable forms of energy can play a major role in achieving national
               climate change mitigation targets critically depends on a large number of factors,
               including technical, economic, institutional, regulatory, legal, and especially also
               cultural and social. In this article we focus on the last of these factors, by analyzing
               the extent to which renewable energy technologies can broadly diffuse in Kenya from
               a public acceptance point of view.

               renewable energy potential, notably in the power sector. Its abundant resources of
               wind, solar, and geothermal energy could be developed not only to expand electricity
               production in a low-carbon fashion, but also to make the electricity generation mix
               more diversified. Today, it relies predominantly on geothermal, hydropower, and imported
               oil products [<a href="#R17">17</a>, <a href="#R21">21</a>] Kenyaâs ambitions with respect to renewable energy deployment have already been
               pursued for some years now. While in 2016 hydropower and fossil fuels still accounted
               for about 35% and 32%, respectively, in an overall installed electricity capacity
               of 2.3 GW [<a href="#R18">18</a>], the share of geothermal power increased from 13% in 2011 to 27% in 2016 [<a href="#R18">18</a>, <a href="#R21">21</a>]. The remaining 6% was divided between mostly wind power and cogeneration, with small
               contributions of 0.03% from solar PV and 0.02% from biogas. Meanwhile, Kenyaâs energy
               system has further developed in favour of renewables: for example, today wind power
               contributes around 14% of the electricity mix since the 310 MW Lake Turkana Wind Power
               project came online.

            <p id="d1e326">The deployment of renewable energy in the electricity sector has been extensively
               described in reports by the Kenyan government and studied in detail in the literature.
               Kenyaâs NEMA (National Environment Management Authority) estimates that wind and solar

               geothermal power has received dedicated attention since many years from both public
               and private entities [<a href="#R17">17</a>, <a href="#R18">18</a>]. In addition, a number of publications have been dedicated to the benefits that
               low-carbon energy technologies could yield in Kenya for rural low-income populations
               [<a href="#R25">25</a>, <a href="#R26">26</a>]. Likewise, studies have been made on their potential contribution to poverty reduction

               issues of public opinion in Kenya.

            <p id="d1e390">Dalla Longa and van der Zwaan (2017) [<a href="#R30">30</a>] analyze Kenyaâs climate change mitigation ambitions from an energy system perspective
               with a focus on the potential contribution from renewable energy technologies. They
               use the TIAM-ECN model with its recently expanded and improved disaggregation for
               Africa [<a href="#R6">6</a>] to characterize possible pathways for the Kenyan energy mix until 2050 under different
               climate change mitigation scenarios. Dalla Longa and van der Zwaan (2017) [<a href="#R30">30</a>] conclude that the power sector can expand with mostly low-carbon energy options,
               even in the absence of stringent climate change control measures. For the demand side
               they find that a substantial deployment of renewable energy is triggered when ambitious
               emission reduction objectives are in place. Their research supports the feasibility
               of the climate management goals of the Kenyan government, provided that sufficient
               investments in low-carbon technologies are made available. They emphasize the potential
               role in the power sector of especially wind, solar PV, and geothermal energy options,
               which enable Kenya meeting its NDC. Hence we focus in this paper on these three renewable
               energy technologies.

            <p id="d1e401">This article builds on the work by SEI (2017) [<a href="#R31">31</a>], whose authors point out that concerted efforts are required to put Kenyaâs energy
               sector on a low-carbon trajectory and that, whilst in principle many options exist
               for low-carbon energy development strategies in Kenya, all of them necessitate both
               extensive financial investments and substantial demands on governance. They recognize
               that important strides are being made towards a low-carbon energy system, but that
               conflicts and untapped synergies remain, especially in terms of perceived trade-offs
               between centralized and decentralized energy solutions, particularly in relation to
               renewable energy resources. SEI (2017) also observes that increasing public and community
               resistance presents additional obstacles to renewable energy projects, particularly
               at places where local participation in planning and local benefit-sharing is limited,
               or is widely perceived to be limited. Key strategies for renewable energy deployment
               success in Kenya include engaging stakeholders early in the development of projects;
               early public dialogue around broader energy development pathways; and transparent
               benefit-sharing mechanisms that are co-designed with affected stakeholders [<a href="#R31">31</a>]. Our present work and the survey we performed are meant to be a first starting point
               for broader active stakeholder engagement.

            <p id="d1e412">We employ for our study the Information-Choice Questionnaire (ICQ) method of surveying
               public opinion, which consists of providing respondents with different options suitable
               to solve a certain problem, along with information on the consequences associated
               with each option [<a href="#R32">32</a>]. The ICQ method thus allows for both analysing and creating informed public opinions,
               since participants partly base their preferences on the provided information. For

               amongst others, of different energy options. Providing public opinion survey participants

               used conventional public opinion surveys [<a href="#R34">34</a>]. The opinions reported by uninformed participants in these traditional surveys appeared
               more arbitrary and more subject to variations, whereas those resulting from ICQ based
               public opinion surveys were largely based on the provided information. The ICQ method
               attempts to present this information in an objective manner.

            <p id="d1e432">Traditional public opinion survey instruments have received considerable criticism.
               Malone <i>et al.</i> (2010) [<a href="#R35">35</a>] similarly argue that the information provided in surveys is never unbiased, and
               therefore the opinions somewhat artificially created and perhaps reflecting researchersâ
               bias. We have tried to mitigate this drawback in a number of ways (<i>e.g.</i> by mostly relying on opinions from Kenyan energy experts, and by <i>e.g.</i> calibrating our statements on reviews of the literature and expert judgement), but
               recognise that these authors in principle make a valid point here. Conscious of the
               possible weaknesses of our ICQ method, we have thus tried to minimize the reporting
               of pseudo-opinions by a number of concrete means, like letting experts participate
               and providing upfront neutral information preceding the survey questions (see also
               Daamen <i>et al.</i>, 2011 [<a href="#R36">36</a>]; ter Mors <i>et al.</i>, 2013 [<a href="#R37">37</a>]).

            <p id="d1e459">Table <a href="#Tab1">1</a> lists all the technology-specific questions asked in our ICQ to a sample of about
               100 interviewees (76 of whom fully completed the survey) on three possible low-carbon
               energy technologies in Kenya: wind, solar PV, and geothermal energy. We chose for
               these three renewable energy options, because they are among the most likely techniques
               for large-scale deployment in the near term future in Kenya. Before these questions,
               some general issues were raised, and the ICQ ended with a few personal questions about
               the respondents themselves. Nearly all respondents were adults living in urban or
               suburban areas (mainly in or around Nairobi). We could not have entirely anticipated
               this <i>a priori</i>, but we ended up having a sample of participants the majority of whom (72%) were
               men, and most of whom were highly educated (92% having a bachelor degree). Also an
               outcome of our ICQârather than an input that we introduced by designâwas that many
               respondents (64%) appeared to consider themselves a relative expert in energy-related
               subjects. Each technology was introduced by starting with a general description consisting
               of a short explanation that outlined Kenyaâs potential for the specific technology
               together with an example project that participants might be familiar with. Subsequently,
               participants were presented various characteristics of each technology, which they
               were asked to evaluate quantitatively. The quantitative ratings from 1 to 9 that respondents
               could use to grade all issues correspond to the qualitative notions of very small
               (1), small (2 or 3), limited (4), fair (5), substantial (6), big (7 or 8) and very
               big (9). These ratings could be applied both when the issue was considered an advantage
               and when it was viewed a disadvantage. In the next section these quantitative and
               qualitative ratings are used consistently, with the â+â sign used for advantages and
               the âââ sign for disadvantages. Participants were given the opportunity to indicate
               that they consider a certain issue unimportant by assigning it the number 0. Both
               before and after reacting to all statements regarding the possible consequences of
               the three energy optionsâthe order of the technologies being randomized for different
               participants to try and minimize systematic errorsârespondents were asked about their
               overall view on each technology on a scale from 1 (very bad) to 9 (very good).

            <p id="d1e467">It is not necessarily the case that all statements in Table <a href="#Tab1">1</a> are entirely true under all circumstances or at every geographical location or point
               in time in Kenya. Yet they are all approximately or in most cases correct, and analysing
               the reactions to the issues they raise is always interesting. Indeed, it is valuable
               to assess the responses to these questions from interviewees despite the fact that,
               under some circumstances, situations can be imagined under which they do not necessarily
               precisely hold. For example, while currently probably often true, the price of wind
               power may in the future or under specific conditions no longer remain somewhat higher
               than that of geothermal electricity or a bit lower than that of solar PV electricity.
               Some of the statements in our ICQ may likewise change dependent on local circumstances.
               For instance, concerns about the noise generated by wind turbines may be justified
               at locations with relatively moderate wind speeds like Ngong Hills, while at Lake
               Turkana they may not be a real issue since wind speeds there are so high that one
               cannot hear the turbines over the noise of the wind. We did not investigate necessarily
               all relevant issues. For example, noise pollution and nuisances from piping infrastructure
               associated with geothermal power plants may be quite substantial, but we did not subject
               these facets to public acceptance tests. Responses to interview questions were assembled
               with Qualtrics software, and the resulting database subjected to statistical analysis
               with Excel and Python.

                  </span> percentiles of the replies to all wind energy related questions in our ICQ. We see
               that respondents consider it a big advantage that the land used for wind energy can
               simultaneously serve agricultural purposes, that the construction of wind turbines
               and their maintenance create employment, and that wind turbines can be built in community
               ownership so that local residents get the opportunity to participate in an investment,
               the returns from which can be in the form of electricity and/or financial benefits.
               Likewise, interviewees attach high value to the fact that wind power contributes to
               Kenyaâs energy independence, that the construction and O &amp; M of wind turbines require
               suitable road infrastructure with new roads providing additional opportunities for
               the area involved, and that the level of GHG emissions associated with wind power
               is low. The fact that the price of wind power may currently be somewhat lower than
               that of solar PV electricity is considered a substantial advantage, but responses
               yield a large range that includes those who think it is only a small advantage. The
               possibility that wind turbines may cause shadow flickering in their immediate vicinity
               leaves around a quarter of respondents indifferent, while most others consider it
               a small to fair disadvantage. The fact that wind turbines are visible elements in
               the landscape yields a broad variety of opinions stretching from the very negative
               to even the very positive, with as many respondents thinking that it is an advantage
               as those considering it a disadvantage. Three statements interviewees generally consider
               genuine disadvantages, but opinions cover practically the entire spectrum of possibilities.
               The fact that wind turbines produce noise that can be heard in their immediate vicinity
               is by many respondents viewed as a small to fair disadvantage. Likewise, respondents
               view the land use requirements of wind power, which preclude certain other land-use
               purposes, a small to fair disadvantage. The statement that the price of wind power
               (per unit of kWh generated) may be somewhat higher than that of geothermal electricity
               is viewed as the most negative drawback among all issues raised, with respondents
               typically finding it a limited to substantial disadvantage.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e878">Across all technologies, no statement receives reactions as positive as the fact that
               Kenya has a suitable climate for solar energy, with infinite solar energy during daytime.
               Half of the respondents qualify it as a very big advantage, while many others consider
               it a substantial to large advantage (see Figure <a href="#Fig2">2</a>). Considered big advantages are also statements informing respondents about the fact
               that for domestic solar PV use there is no central electricity grid needed, which
               makes solar PV an option to improve electricity access in remote areas, that solar
               PV increases energy access in Kenya without requiring expansions of the energy infrastructure,
               and that solar PV energy production can be incorporated with minimal land use involved
               since modules can be placed on roofs. The observations that the installation of solar
               PV modules and their operation create employment, that entrepreneurs offer the possibility
               to hire or lease a PV-panel as an alternative to fully purchasing a PV system, and
               that the level of greenhouse gas emissions associated with solar PV energy is low
               are viewed as big advantages as well, but in these cases a minority of respondents
               only consider these small advantages. To ensure quality and durability of solar PV
               systems, training on maintenance for users and technicians is needed. On average this
               is considered a fair advantage, but interviewees display rather polarising reactions,
               from the very positive down to the quite negative. Most people find it either unimportant
               or consider it a small to substantial advantage that solar PV modules are clearly
               visible objects on properties or houses. Roughly equally split between (very or a
               little) positive and negative are respondents with regards to the fact that, in the
               case of individual ownership, the owner is responsible for the functioning and maintenance
               of the solar modules, which involves installing the device, regular cleaning, and
               small repairs. It is viewed as a limited disadvantage that solar PV is an intermittent
               energy source, meaning that storage of energy and balancing power sources are required
               in order to guarantee electricity availability at all times, and that domestic solar
               PV systems require initial investment costs, but there is very much variation in the
               responses to these statements. All respondents express negative thoughts about the
               fact that storage options for solar PV are expensive, so that electricity access in
               the evening and night can be unreliable when no other energy sources are used. This
               is on average considered a substantial disadvantage: among the thirteen statements
               on PV presented to the people interrogated, this one raises the most negative reactions.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e883">For geothermal energy, Figure <a href="#Fig3">3</a> illustrates that three characteristics are generally considered big advantages. First,
               geothermal energy could provide for a large share of Kenyaâs total electricity supply.
               Second, Kenya provides a suitable environment for geothermal energy, as it possesses
               many potential geothermal energy sites. Third, in Kenya geothermal technologies provide
               one of the cheapest options to produce energy, the running costs (but not the investment
               costs) of which are perhaps comparable to electricity generated with hydropower dams.
               Also, typically big advantages are observations that examples are known of combining
               geothermal power production with touristic attractions such as hot springs. Likewise,
               that the level of greenhouse gas emissions associated with geothermal energy is rather
               low. And similarly that an increase in the use of geothermal electricity could create
               jobs at the power plants and through the installation of transmission lines, although
               some view these as only small or limited advantages. The fact that the spatial usage
               of geothermal installations is relatively small, with current geothermal plants occupying
               approximately 1 km<span class="inline-formula">

                  </span> per plant, is by most interviewees considered a small to substantial advantage, but
               some other view it as a drawback. Two issues that splits people roughly equally between
               positive and negative reactions are phrases stating that geothermal energy installations
               are visible in the landscape, such as the Olkaria II plant in Naivasha, and that in
               contrast to off-grid options, an increase in geothermal electricity production requires
               an expansion of the transmission network. The facts that seismological activity may
               occur in association with the use of geothermal energy, and that, in comparison to
               other renewable energy sources, geothermal energy plants require a relatively large
               amount of water resources used for cooling purposes, are on average considered substantial
               disadvantages. Big disadvantages are statements explaining that emissions of sulphur
               dioxide from geothermal energy production could potentially impact the surrounding
               environment, that geothermal power plants could potentially lead to fresh water reservoir
               contamination, and that installing geothermal energy plants might involve relocation
               of community land. With regard to each of these three observations, however, some
               respondents only possess small to limited negative thoughts.

            <p id="d1e897">From Figures <a href="#Fig1">1</a>, <a href="#Fig2">2</a>, and <a href="#Fig3">3</a> some clear overall tendencies can be observed. First, for some statements the reactions
               are rather homogeneous, whether negative or positive, with narrow uncertainty ranges
               around clear-cut central values that leave little doubt with respect to what most
               respondents typically think on the matter. Second, for some other questions the views
               are quite heterogeneous with (nearly) any possible answer provided, down from the
               clearly negative up to the positive. Third, for yet some other observationsâfor instance
               on the likelihood that wind turbines may generate inconveniences like noise and shadowsâa
               non-negligible number of interviewees surprisingly respond with positive views, which
               begs the question whether the statements regarding these negative impacts were well
               expressed and/or understood.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e908">We are well aware of the fact that the reaction distributions we retrieved could well
               have been different if other sets of respondents had been chosen, for example with
               more people from other parts of the country, with different educational backgrounds,
               or with different levels of pre-existing knowledge about renewable energy technologies.
               Likewise, reactions may be subject to temporal developments and change over time,
               either because facts-on-the-ground change (such as the costs of technologies like
               PV modules, or unexpected benefits or drawbacks that emerge from the deployment of
               specific energy options) or because the people using, operating, or experiencing renewable
               energy technologies modify their attitudes towards them (<i>e.g.</i> when accepting certain inconveniences of intermittent renewables against growing
               local impacts from climate change). These phenomena generate variations and uncertainties
               that are inherent to our methodology. Their detailed assessment falls beyond the scope
               of this study.

            <p id="d1e1021">Several generic observations can be made with regards to the results shown in Figures
               <a href="#Fig1">1</a>, <a href="#Fig2">2</a>, and <a href="#Fig3">3</a> for wind, solar PV, and geothermal energy, respectively. For wind energy, two topics
               seem predominant in determining the public opinion of local (semi-)experts: its price
               with regards to its (renewable) competitors and its land use implications. According
               to respondents, it is clearly important whether or not wind electricity is cheaper
               than that from PV or geothermal plants. For the Kenyans in our sample it appears also
               very relevant that wind turbine parks may exclude certain types of land use, such
               as for residential or commercial purposes, while permitting certain others like agricultural
               activity. Clear benefits are attached to a variety of socio-economic and environmental
               features of wind turbines, such as the creation of employment, infrastructure, energy
               independence, and the preclusion of GHG emissions. Some of the inconveniences of wind
               turbines, including visibility, noise and shadow effects, draw mixed reactions, as
               is the case in those developed countries that at present deploy large wind energy
               development programmes.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e1032">The largest perceived benefits of solar PV are resource or infrastructure related:
               the fact that Kenya has an enormous solar energy resource potential and that household
               PV panel systems preclude the need for large power grid expansions, while still permitting
               universal electricity access, are clearly viewed as one of PVâs largest assets. Like
               with wind power, predominant other factors relate to prices and land-use. The fact
               that domestic PV panel usage requires expensive storage devices to compensate for
               PVâs intermittency is seen as one of this optionâs main disadvantages, while among
               its great advantages is that PV (up to a certain size) can be installed on roofs of
               houses and private or public buildings, thereby not yielding competition with other
               types of land-use (at a bigger scale, large arrays of PV panels would need to be constructed
               on the ground, but crops can sometimes be grown underneath them). Socio-economic and
               environmental arguments related to employment generation and reduction of GHG emissions
               also generally work much in favour of PV. Issues of visibility of PV panels and needs
               for cleaning, maintenance, repairs and associated training are received with mixed
               reactions.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e1034">The fact that one could exploit Kenyaâs unique geothermal energy resources and that
               these could provide for a large share of the national power and heat requirements
               draws universally favourable attitudes from the public. Similarly to wind energy and
               solar PV, there are a few key characteristics affecting the acceptance of geothermal
               energy, particularly costs and land-use requirements. The geological conditions in
               Kenya yielding likely low energy service costs is clearly viewed among geothermal
               energyâs largest benefits. The same holds for the fact that geothermal energy plants
               occupy little land, but on the downside is the possibility of some communities needing
               to be relocated, which yields sizeable potential for public resistance. Socio-economic
               and environmental benefits of geothermal energy associated with job creation, development
               of tourism, and mitigation of climate change clearly contribute to the positive view
               that respondents hold on geothermal energy. Issues of visibility of installations
               and need of grid expansion divide people into roughly equal groups of supportive respectively
               unfavourable attitudes. Awareness of fresh water usage and/or contamination, as well
               as possibly other types of environmental pollution and seismic activity, provokes
               sizeable criticism.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e1036">Figure <a href="#Fig4">4</a> shows that overall all three renewable energy technologies receive a positive rating,
               and that statistically one cannot distinguish or rank them. There is only a hint towards
               PV being slightly preferable above wind and geothermal energy. No firm conclusion
               can be drawn either about the effect of informing the respondents with more detail
               about the possible consequences of the deployment of these technologies. The graph
               suggests a potential tendency that the favourable opinions about wind energy and solar
               PV become more assured once more information is provided, given the narrowing of the

               if some of its potential drawbacks are revealed. Yet both these observations remain
               unproven as a result of the statistical, and potentially also systematic, uncertainty
               margins of our public opinion tests. One of the drawbacks of our study is the relatively
               small size of our sample of respondents. A larger sample would yield statistically
               more meaningful results, which could confirm or disprove the trends we observe here.

            <p id="d1e1107">In this paper we have demonstrated that, for a group of relatively expert Kenyan nationals
               consisting mostly of well-educated men, public acceptance in Kenya of three renewable
               energy optionsâwind, PV, and geothermalâis generally high. Substantial resource potential
               exists for all these renewable energy alternatives. Scenario analysis such as by Dalla
               Longa and van der Zwaan (2017) [<a href="#R30">30</a>] has pointed out that from an economic point of view it appears sensible to employ
               these renewables in efforts by the Kenyan government to reach its nationally determined
               commitment under the Paris Agreement. Here we complement their cost-optimality study
               with evidence that, from a public opinion perspective, it also seems feasible, and
               even desirable, to implement wind, solar PV, and geothermal technologies in order
               to meet Kenyaâs national contribution to limit global climate change to 2<span class="inline-formula">

            <p id="d1e1121">Clear appreciation exists among the respondents in our study of Kenyaâs large resource
               potentials for wind, PV and geothermal energy. The price for the delivered energy
               services is one of the main points of public concern, which contributes to determining
               their relative ranking, as well as their score with respect to other, notably fossil
               fuel-based, energy options. Availability of cheap fossil fuels thus constitutes a
               threat for the deployment of renewables. From a cost perspective, geothermal power
               may currently be the most attractive renewable energy alternative in Kenya, but if
               the right locations are chosen with optimal wind conditions, wind energy could be
               at the competitive edge. PV could deliver access to electricity in those regions with
               sub-optimal wind or geothermal resources, notably when its impressive cost reductions
               over the past years continue to yield price decreases in the future. Land-use requirements
               constitute another important factor in shaping peopleâs opinions about renewable energy
               options. PV appears the forerunner in this respect, readily followed by geothermal
               energy, while wind power may be favourable in this regard if its areal needs can be
               synergized with simultaneous land-use for other purposes, such as agriculture.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e1123">Regarding the value interviewees associate with infrastructural prerequisites, PV
               appears preferential over wind and geothermal energy because of the absence of electricity
               grid expansion for many PV applications, notably those at individual homes. The infrastructure
               needs of wind and geothermal energyâ<i>e.g.</i> road construction around the facilitiesâare often considered a public co-benefit
               that can serve other purposes as well. The broader socio-economic and environmental
               sustainability arguments in favour of wind, PV, and geothermal energy clearly contribute
               to explaining their popularity as well.
               
            </p>
            <p id="d1e1128">Yet governments, when designing policies stimulating the deployment and use of these
               promising renewable energy options, should be aware of a broad range of possible inconveniences
               associated with them, for example in terms of possible emissions of certain types
               of pollutants or other forms of environmental degradation or personal nuisance. Policy
               makers and stakeholders could try to better understand and anticipate these potential
               negative impacts in view of the importance of public acceptance for large-scale renewable
               energy deployment. The Kenyan government could address matters of local acceptance
               by engaging with the public in early stages of renewable energy planning and deployment,
               for instance through surveys like the one we used for the present study. In this way,
               more robust design of policies and institutions could help to overcome some of the
               obstacles that have impeded rapid diffusion of specific renewable energy options in
               other countries. With this paper we have made a start with gauging the public opinion
               regarding renewable energy deployment in Kenya. Further work should certainly be undertaken
               in this respect, for example in terms of the particular importance and sensitivity
               of land use issues for human livelihoods in Kenya, as well as the thus far poorly
               investigated impacts of renewable energy technologies on natural habitats for various
               species (e.g. birds, notably in relation to geothermal energy).
