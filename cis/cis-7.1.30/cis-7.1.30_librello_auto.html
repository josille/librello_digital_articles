                                 of three renewable energy options in Kenya: wind, solar PV, and geothermal energy.
                                 With these renewable technologies, the government of Kenya could make a large contribution
                                 to reaching its national commitment under the Paris Agreement. Prices, infrastructural
                                 needs, and land-use requirements importantly contribute to shaping public opinion
                                 about these renewable energy alternatives, in different ways and directions for wind,
                                 PV, and geothermal energy. While overall the evaluation of these technologies is positive,
                                 public authorities should be wary of the possible inconveniences and drawbacks associated
                                 with them. Anticipating and, where possible, mitigating these shortcomings in national
                                 climate and energy development plans could preclude some of them becoming possible
                                 hindrances for broad-scale adoption of wind, PV, and geothermal energy. Furthering
                                 quantitative public acceptance studies, like the one presented here based on (semi-)expert
                                 elicitation and information-choice questionnaires, can assist in Kenya fully reaching
                                 its national climate and energy ambitions. More generally, we argue that the establishment
                                 of affordable, clean, and secure energy systems, as well as the mitigation of global
                                 climate change, can benefit from stakeholder engagement and public survey analysis
                                 like the one performed in our study â in developing countries as much as in the developed
                                 part of the world.</span></div>

                              <p id="d1e190">Climate change is one of the largest challenges facing mankind this century, and transforming
                                 our global economy according to universal principles of sustainable development is
                                 top priority on the political agenda of the international community [<a href="#R1">1</a>]. Particularly important is supporting countries in the worldâs developing regions
                                 to combine persistent economic growth with efforts to mitigate emissions of gases
                                 that cause global warming. The establishment of energy transition pathways, in which
                                 fossil fuels are gradually replaced with low-carbon energy options, is assisted by
                                 energy systems modelling exercises in which alternative transformation scenarios are
                                 quantified, analysed, and compared [<a href="#R2">2</a>].While these modelling efforts have thus far mostly focused on developed countries,
                                 a few similar studies have been undertaken for developing countries recently (see
                                 e.g. Altieri <i>et al.</i>, 2016 [<a href="#R3">3</a>]; Taliotis <i>et al.</i>, 2016 [<a href="#R4">4</a>]; Lucas <i>et al.</i>, 2017 [<a href="#R5">5</a>]; van der Zwaan <i>et al.</i>, 2018 [<a href="#R6">6</a>]).
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e223">To advance studies in the field of energy transition pathways in the developing world,
                                 we focus in this paper on an important African country, Kenya. Socio-scientific studies
                                 on the deployment of low-carbon and/or renewable forms of energy importantly complement
                                 energy and climate scenario modelling work. A relatively large number of studies have
                                 been performed that investigate the role of public or expert opinions on energy system
                                 transformation pathways or individual innovative energy technologies in developed
                                 countries (see e.g. de Best-Waldhober <i>et al.</i>, 2012 [<a href="#R7">7</a>]; Baker <i>et al.</i>, 2015 [<a href="#R8">8</a>]).Only few studies have so far been undertaken on public opinion with regards to
                                 energy and climate change issues in Africa (a few examples are Camblong <i>et al.</i>, 2009 on Senegal [<a href="#R9">9</a>]; Wetangâula, 2010 on Kenya [<a href="#R10">10</a>]; Ondraczek, 2011 on Kenya and Tanzania [<a href="#R11">11</a>]; Bouzidi, 2011 on Algeria [<a href="#R12">12</a>]; and Hanger <i>et al.</i>, 2016 on Morocco [<a href="#R13">13</a>]). We think that this paucity should urgently be rectified, given the importance
                                 of swiftly deploying renewable energy technologies in Africa on a large scale and
                                 of the role of public acceptance issues therein. The present paper attempts to make
                                 a step in that direction by presenting a (semi-)expert elicitation based case study
                                 on public attitudes towards renewable energy in Kenya.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e259">Our approach aims to characterise attitudes of participants towards three different
                                 renewable energy technologiesâwind, PV, and geothermal energyâbased on their responses
                                 to objective information we provided on the possible impacts of these technologies.
                                 Participants are informed that each of these three renewable energy technologies may
                                 be able to contribute to solving global climate change. But participants are also
                                 provided with the possible consequences associated with the use and/or deployment

                                 concluded in 2015 and ratified a year later [<a href="#R14">14</a>], the Kenyan Government has obliged itself to a ânationally determined contributionâ
                                 (NDC) of reducing domestic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 30% in 2030 in comparison

                                 climate change mitigation targets critically depends on a large number of factors,

                                 renewable energy potential, notably in the power sector. Its abundant resources of
                                 wind, solar, and geothermal energy could be developed not only to expand electricity
                                 production in a low-carbon fashion, but also to make the electricity generation mix
                                 more diversified. Today, it relies predominantly on geothermal, hydropower, and imported
                                 oil products [<a href="#R17">17</a>, <a href="#R21">21</a>] Kenyaâs ambitions with respect to renewable energy deployment have already been
                                 pursued for some years now. While in 2016 hydropower and fossil fuels still accounted
                                 for about 35% and 32%, respectively, in an overall installed electricity capacity
                                 of 2.3 GW [<a href="#R18">18</a>], the share of geothermal power increased from 13% in 2011 to 27% in 2016 [<a href="#R18">18</a>, <a href="#R21">21</a>]. The remaining 6% was divided between mostly wind power and cogeneration, with small
                                 contributions of 0.03% from solar PV and 0.02% from biogas. Meanwhile, Kenyaâs energy
                                 system has further developed in favour of renewables: for example, today wind power
                                 contributes around 14% of the electricity mix since the 310 MW Lake Turkana Wind Power

                                 possible weaknesses of our ICQ method, we have thus tried to minimize the reporting
                                 of pseudo-opinions by a number of concrete means, like letting experts participate
                                 and providing upfront neutral information preceding the survey questions (see also
                                 Daamen <i>et al.</i>, 2011 [<a href="#R36">36</a>]; ter Mors <i>et al.</i>, 2013 [<a href="#R37">37</a>]).

                              <p id="d1e459">Table <a href="#Tab1">1</a> lists all the technology-specific questions asked in our ICQ to a sample of about
                                 100 interviewees (76 of whom fully completed the survey) on three possible low-carbon
                                 energy technologies in Kenya: wind, solar PV, and geothermal energy. We chose for
                                 these three renewable energy options, because they are among the most likely techniques
                                 for large-scale deployment in the near term future in Kenya. Before these questions,
                                 some general issues were raised, and the ICQ ended with a few personal questions about
                                 the respondents themselves. Nearly all respondents were adults living in urban or
                                 suburban areas (mainly in or around Nairobi). We could not have entirely anticipated
                                 this <i>a priori</i>, but we ended up having a sample of participants the majority of whom (72%) were
                                 men, and most of whom were highly educated (92% having a bachelor degree). Also an
                                 outcome of our ICQârather than an input that we introduced by designâwas that many
                                 respondents (64%) appeared to consider themselves a relative expert in energy-related
                                 subjects. Each technology was introduced by starting with a general description consisting
                                 of a short explanation that outlined Kenyaâs potential for the specific technology
                                 together with an example project that participants might be familiar with. Subsequently,
                                 participants were presented various characteristics of each technology, which they
                                 were asked to evaluate quantitatively. The quantitative ratings from 1 to 9 that respondents
                                 could use to grade all issues correspond to the qualitative notions of very small
                                 (1), small (2 or 3), limited (4), fair (5), substantial (6), big (7 or 8) and very
                                 big (9). These ratings could be applied both when the issue was considered an advantage
                                 and when it was viewed a disadvantage. In the next section these quantitative and
                                 qualitative ratings are used consistently, with the â+â sign used for advantages and
                                 the âââ sign for disadvantages. Participants were given the opportunity to indicate
                                 that they consider a certain issue unimportant by assigning it the number 0. Both
                                 before and after reacting to all statements regarding the possible consequences of
                                 the three energy optionsâthe order of the technologies being randomized for different
                                 participants to try and minimize systematic errorsârespondents were asked about their
                                 overall view on each technology on a scale from 1 (very bad) to 9 (very good).

                              <p id="d1e467">It is not necessarily the case that all statements in Table <a href="#Tab1">1</a> are entirely true under all circumstances or at every geographical location or point
                                 in time in Kenya. Yet they are all approximately or in most cases correct, and analysing
                                 the reactions to the issues they raise is always interesting. Indeed, it is valuable
                                 to assess the responses to these questions from interviewees despite the fact that,
                                 under some circumstances, situations can be imagined under which they do not necessarily
                                 precisely hold. For example, while currently probably often true, the price of wind
                                 power may in the future or under specific conditions no longer remain somewhat higher
                                 than that of geothermal electricity or a bit lower than that of solar PV electricity.
                                 Some of the statements in our ICQ may likewise change dependent on local circumstances.
                                 For instance, concerns about the noise generated by wind turbines may be justified
                                 at locations with relatively moderate wind speeds like Ngong Hills, while at Lake
                                 Turkana they may not be a real issue since wind speeds there are so high that one
                                 cannot hear the turbines over the noise of the wind. We did not investigate necessarily
                                 all relevant issues. For example, noise pollution and nuisances from piping infrastructure
                                 associated with geothermal power plants may be quite substantial, but we did not subject
                                 these facets to public acceptance tests. Responses to interview questions were assembled
                                 with Qualtrics software, and the resulting database subjected to statistical analysis
                                 with Excel and Python.

                                    </span> percentiles of the replies to all wind energy related questions in our ICQ. We see
                                 that respondents consider it a big advantage that the land used for wind energy can
                                 simultaneously serve agricultural purposes, that the construction of wind turbines
                                 and their maintenance create employment, and that wind turbines can be built in community
                                 ownership so that local residents get the opportunity to participate in an investment,
                                 the returns from which can be in the form of electricity and/or financial benefits.
                                 Likewise, interviewees attach high value to the fact that wind power contributes to
                                 Kenyaâs energy independence, that the construction and O &amp; M of wind turbines require
                                 suitable road infrastructure with new roads providing additional opportunities for
                                 the area involved, and that the level of GHG emissions associated with wind power
                                 is low. The fact that the price of wind power may currently be somewhat lower than
                                 that of solar PV electricity is considered a substantial advantage, but responses
                                 yield a large range that includes those who think it is only a small advantage. The
                                 possibility that wind turbines may cause shadow flickering in their immediate vicinity
                                 leaves around a quarter of respondents indifferent, while most others consider it
                                 a small to fair disadvantage. The fact that wind turbines are visible elements in
                                 the landscape yields a broad variety of opinions stretching from the very negative
                                 to even the very positive, with as many respondents thinking that it is an advantage
                                 as those considering it a disadvantage. Three statements interviewees generally consider
                                 genuine disadvantages, but opinions cover practically the entire spectrum of possibilities.
                                 The fact that wind turbines produce noise that can be heard in their immediate vicinity
                                 is by many respondents viewed as a small to fair disadvantage. Likewise, respondents
                                 view the land use requirements of wind power, which preclude certain other land-use
                                 purposes, a small to fair disadvantage. The statement that the price of wind power
                                 (per unit of kWh generated) may be somewhat higher than that of geothermal electricity
                                 is viewed as the most negative drawback among all issues raised, with respondents
                                 typically finding it a limited to substantial disadvantage.

                              <p id="d1e878">Across all technologies, no statement receives reactions as positive as the fact that
                                 Kenya has a suitable climate for solar energy, with infinite solar energy during daytime.
                                 Half of the respondents qualify it as a very big advantage, while many others consider
                                 it a substantial to large advantage (see Figure <a href="#Fig2">2</a>). Considered big advantages are also statements informing respondents about the fact
                                 that for domestic solar PV use there is no central electricity grid needed, which
                                 makes solar PV an option to improve electricity access in remote areas, that solar
                                 PV increases energy access in Kenya without requiring expansions of the energy infrastructure,
                                 and that solar PV energy production can be incorporated with minimal land use involved
                                 since modules can be placed on roofs. The observations that the installation of solar
                                 PV modules and their operation create employment, that entrepreneurs offer the possibility
                                 to hire or lease a PV-panel as an alternative to fully purchasing a PV system, and
                                 that the level of greenhouse gas emissions associated with solar PV energy is low
                                 are viewed as big advantages as well, but in these cases a minority of respondents
                                 only consider these small advantages. To ensure quality and durability of solar PV
                                 systems, training on maintenance for users and technicians is needed. On average this
                                 is considered a fair advantage, but interviewees display rather polarising reactions,
                                 from the very positive down to the quite negative. Most people find it either unimportant
                                 or consider it a small to substantial advantage that solar PV modules are clearly
                                 visible objects on properties or houses. Roughly equally split between (very or a
                                 little) positive and negative are respondents with regards to the fact that, in the
                                 case of individual ownership, the owner is responsible for the functioning and maintenance
                                 of the solar modules, which involves installing the device, regular cleaning, and
                                 small repairs. It is viewed as a limited disadvantage that solar PV is an intermittent
                                 energy source, meaning that storage of energy and balancing power sources are required
                                 in order to guarantee electricity availability at all times, and that domestic solar
                                 PV systems require initial investment costs, but there is very much variation in the
                                 responses to these statements. All respondents express negative thoughts about the
                                 fact that storage options for solar PV are expensive, so that electricity access in
                                 the evening and night can be unreliable when no other energy sources are used. This
                                 is on average considered a substantial disadvantage: among the thirteen statements
                                 on PV presented to the people interrogated, this one raises the most negative reactions.

                              <p id="d1e883">For geothermal energy, Figure <a href="#Fig3">3</a> illustrates that three characteristics are generally considered big advantages. First,
                                 geothermal energy could provide for a large share of Kenyaâs total electricity supply.
                                 Second, Kenya provides a suitable environment for geothermal energy, as it possesses
                                 many potential geothermal energy sites. Third, in Kenya geothermal technologies provide
                                 one of the cheapest options to produce energy, the running costs (but not the investment
                                 costs) of which are perhaps comparable to electricity generated with hydropower dams.
                                 Also, typically big advantages are observations that examples are known of combining
                                 geothermal power production with touristic attractions such as hot springs. Likewise,
                                 that the level of greenhouse gas emissions associated with geothermal energy is rather
                                 low. And similarly that an increase in the use of geothermal electricity could create
                                 jobs at the power plants and through the installation of transmission lines, although
                                 some view these as only small or limited advantages. The fact that the spatial usage
                                 of geothermal installations is relatively small, with current geothermal plants occupying
                                 approximately 1 km<span class="inline-formula">

                                 some other view it as a drawback. Two issues that splits people roughly equally between
                                 positive and negative reactions are phrases stating that geothermal energy installations
                                 are visible in the landscape, such as the Olkaria II plant in Naivasha, and that in
                                 contrast to off-grid options, an increase in geothermal electricity production requires
                                 an expansion of the transmission network. The facts that seismological activity may
                                 occur in association with the use of geothermal energy, and that, in comparison to
                                 other renewable energy sources, geothermal energy plants require a relatively large
                                 amount of water resources used for cooling purposes, are on average considered substantial
                                 disadvantages. Big disadvantages are statements explaining that emissions of sulphur
                                 dioxide from geothermal energy production could potentially impact the surrounding
                                 environment, that geothermal power plants could potentially lead to fresh water reservoir
                                 contamination, and that installing geothermal energy plants might involve relocation
                                 of community land. With regard to each of these three observations, however, some
                                 respondents only possess small to limited negative thoughts.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e897">From Figures <a href="#Fig1">1</a>, <a href="#Fig2">2</a>, and <a href="#Fig3">3</a> some clear overall tendencies can be observed. First, for some statements the reactions
                                 are rather homogeneous, whether negative or positive, with narrow uncertainty ranges
                                 around clear-cut central values that leave little doubt with respect to what most
                                 respondents typically think on the matter. Second, for some other questions the views
                                 are quite heterogeneous with (nearly) any possible answer provided, down from the
                                 clearly negative up to the positive. Third, for yet some other observationsâfor instance
                                 on the likelihood that wind turbines may generate inconveniences like noise and shadowsâa
                                 non-negligible number of interviewees surprisingly respond with positive views, which
                                 begs the question whether the statements regarding these negative impacts were well
                                 expressed and/or understood.

                              <p id="d1e908">We are well aware of the fact that the reaction distributions we retrieved could well
                                 have been different if other sets of respondents had been chosen, for example with
                                 more people from other parts of the country, with different educational backgrounds,
                                 or with different levels of pre-existing knowledge about renewable energy technologies.
                                 Likewise, reactions may be subject to temporal developments and change over time,
                                 either because facts-on-the-ground change (such as the costs of technologies like
                                 PV modules, or unexpected benefits or drawbacks that emerge from the deployment of
                                 specific energy options) or because the people using, operating, or experiencing renewable
                                 energy technologies modify their attitudes towards them (<i>e.g.</i> when accepting certain inconveniences of intermittent renewables against growing
                                 local impacts from climate change). These phenomena generate variations and uncertainties
                                 that are inherent to our methodology. Their detailed assessment falls beyond the scope

                                 <a href="#Fig1">1</a>, <a href="#Fig2">2</a>, and <a href="#Fig3">3</a> for wind, solar PV, and geothermal energy, respectively. For wind energy, two topics
                                 seem predominant in determining the public opinion of local (semi-)experts: its price
                                 with regards to its (renewable) competitors and its land use implications. According
                                 to respondents, it is clearly important whether or not wind electricity is cheaper
                                 than that from PV or geothermal plants. For the Kenyans in our sample it appears also
                                 very relevant that wind turbine parks may exclude certain types of land use, such
                                 as for residential or commercial purposes, while permitting certain others like agricultural
                                 activity. Clear benefits are attached to a variety of socio-economic and environmental
                                 features of wind turbines, such as the creation of employment, infrastructure, energy
                                 independence, and the preclusion of GHG emissions. Some of the inconveniences of wind
                                 turbines, including visibility, noise and shadow effects, draw mixed reactions, as
                                 is the case in those developed countries that at present deploy large wind energy
                                 development programmes.

                              <p id="d1e1032">The largest perceived benefits of solar PV are resource or infrastructure related:
                                 the fact that Kenya has an enormous solar energy resource potential and that household
                                 PV panel systems preclude the need for large power grid expansions, while still permitting
                                 universal electricity access, are clearly viewed as one of PVâs largest assets. Like
                                 with wind power, predominant other factors relate to prices and land-use. The fact
                                 that domestic PV panel usage requires expensive storage devices to compensate for
                                 PVâs intermittency is seen as one of this optionâs main disadvantages, while among
                                 its great advantages is that PV (up to a certain size) can be installed on roofs of
                                 houses and private or public buildings, thereby not yielding competition with other
                                 types of land-use (at a bigger scale, large arrays of PV panels would need to be constructed
                                 on the ground, but crops can sometimes be grown underneath them). Socio-economic and
                                 environmental arguments related to employment generation and reduction of GHG emissions
                                 also generally work much in favour of PV. Issues of visibility of PV panels and needs
                                 for cleaning, maintenance, repairs and associated training are received with mixed
                                 reactions.

                              <p id="d1e1034">The fact that one could exploit Kenyaâs unique geothermal energy resources and that
                                 these could provide for a large share of the national power and heat requirements
                                 draws universally favourable attitudes from the public. Similarly to wind energy and
                                 solar PV, there are a few key characteristics affecting the acceptance of geothermal
                                 energy, particularly costs and land-use requirements. The geological conditions in
                                 Kenya yielding likely low energy service costs is clearly viewed among geothermal
                                 energyâs largest benefits. The same holds for the fact that geothermal energy plants
                                 occupy little land, but on the downside is the possibility of some communities needing
                                 to be relocated, which yields sizeable potential for public resistance. Socio-economic
                                 and environmental benefits of geothermal energy associated with job creation, development
                                 of tourism, and mitigation of climate change clearly contribute to the positive view
                                 that respondents hold on geothermal energy. Issues of visibility of installations
                                 and need of grid expansion divide people into roughly equal groups of supportive respectively
                                 unfavourable attitudes. Awareness of fresh water usage and/or contamination, as well
                                 as possibly other types of environmental pollution and seismic activity, provokes
                                 sizeable criticism.

                              <p id="d1e1036">Figure <a href="#Fig4">4</a> shows that overall all three renewable energy technologies receive a positive rating,
                                 and that statistically one cannot distinguish or rank them. There is only a hint towards
                                 PV being slightly preferable above wind and geothermal energy. No firm conclusion
                                 can be drawn either about the effect of informing the respondents with more detail
                                 about the possible consequences of the deployment of these technologies. The graph

                                 if some of its potential drawbacks are revealed. Yet both these observations remain
                                 unproven as a result of the statistical, and potentially also systematic, uncertainty
                                 margins of our public opinion tests. One of the drawbacks of our study is the relatively
                                 small size of our sample of respondents. A larger sample would yield statistically
                                 more meaningful results, which could confirm or disprove the trends we observe here.

                                 consisting mostly of well-educated men, public acceptance in Kenya of three renewable
                                 energy optionsâwind, PV, and geothermalâis generally high. Substantial resource potential
                                 exists for all these renewable energy alternatives. Scenario analysis such as by Dalla
                                 Longa and van der Zwaan (2017) [<a href="#R30">30</a>] has pointed out that from an economic point of view it appears sensible to employ
                                 these renewables in efforts by the Kenyan government to reach its nationally determined
                                 commitment under the Paris Agreement. Here we complement their cost-optimality study
                                 with evidence that, from a public opinion perspective, it also seems feasible, and
                                 even desirable, to implement wind, solar PV, and geothermal technologies in order
                                 to meet Kenyaâs national contribution to limit global climate change to 2<span class="inline-formula">

                              <p id="d1e1121">Clear appreciation exists among the respondents in our study of Kenyaâs large resource
                                 potentials for wind, PV and geothermal energy. The price for the delivered energy
                                 services is one of the main points of public concern, which contributes to determining
                                 their relative ranking, as well as their score with respect to other, notably fossil
                                 fuel-based, energy options. Availability of cheap fossil fuels thus constitutes a
                                 threat for the deployment of renewables. From a cost perspective, geothermal power
                                 may currently be the most attractive renewable energy alternative in Kenya, but if
                                 the right locations are chosen with optimal wind conditions, wind energy could be
                                 at the competitive edge. PV could deliver access to electricity in those regions with
                                 sub-optimal wind or geothermal resources, notably when its impressive cost reductions
                                 over the past years continue to yield price decreases in the future. Land-use requirements
                                 constitute another important factor in shaping peopleâs opinions about renewable energy
                                 options. PV appears the forerunner in this respect, readily followed by geothermal
                                 energy, while wind power may be favourable in this regard if its areal needs can be
                                 synergized with simultaneous land-use for other purposes, such as agriculture.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e1123">Regarding the value interviewees associate with infrastructural prerequisites, PV
                                 appears preferential over wind and geothermal energy because of the absence of electricity
                                 grid expansion for many PV applications, notably those at individual homes. The infrastructure
                                 needs of wind and geothermal energyâ<i>e.g.</i> road construction around the facilitiesâare often considered a public co-benefit
                                 that can serve other purposes as well. The broader socio-economic and environmental
                                 sustainability arguments in favour of wind, PV, and geothermal energy clearly contribute
                                 to explaining their popularity as well.

                              <p id="d1e1128">Yet governments, when designing policies stimulating the deployment and use of these
                                 promising renewable energy options, should be aware of a broad range of possible inconveniences
                                 associated with them, for example in terms of possible emissions of certain types
                                 of pollutants or other forms of environmental degradation or personal nuisance. Policy
                                 makers and stakeholders could try to better understand and anticipate these potential
                                 negative impacts in view of the importance of public acceptance for large-scale renewable
                                 energy deployment. The Kenyan government could address matters of local acceptance
                                 by engaging with the public in early stages of renewable energy planning and deployment,
                                 for instance through surveys like the one we used for the present study. In this way,
                                 more robust design of policies and institutions could help to overcome some of the
                                 obstacles that have impeded rapid diffusion of specific renewable energy options in
                                 other countries. With this paper we have made a start with gauging the public opinion
                                 regarding renewable energy deployment in Kenya. Further work should certainly be undertaken
                                 in this respect, for example in terms of the particular importance and sensitivity
                                 of land use issues for human livelihoods in Kenya, as well as the thus far poorly
                                 investigated impacts of renewable energy technologies on natural habitats for various
                                 species (e.g. birds, notably in relation to geothermal energy).
