Worldwide,
                                 there are several livable city ranking schemes in use, which compare the livability
                                 of cities by making use of standardized indicator sets. The research presented here
                                 recognizes, as a point of departure, that each city is unique, implying that comparisons
                                 of cities by standardized categories only does not adequately reflect the reality
                                 of each city. A qualitative approach to identify context-specific categories of livability
                                 is proposed and employed to the case of Malmo ̈ in Sweden. Through interviews, nine
                                 context-specific categories were identified and visualized. The findings of the study
                                 demonstrate that a qualitative approach enables a more in-depth description of livability
                                 categories because it can capture and illustrate relationships among the categories.
                                 An explicit awareness of such relationships may provide a more holistic perspective
                                 to city officials and planners as they aim to improve the livability of their cities.
                                 The study concludes that a qualitative approach in identifying context-specific categories
                                 can complement existing assessment schemes and allow a better grasp of livability

                              <p id="d1e125">Cities are widely considered as pivotal actors for sustainable development efforts.
                                 Goal 11 of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aims at ensuring
                                 inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable development of urban settlements [<a href="#R01">1</a>], and urbanization can be seen as a positive driver for socio-economic development
                                 in cities. Some of the benefits it might (but does not necessarily) bring include
                                 (i) the fostering of human resource development, (ii) improved quality of life for
                                 dwellers, and (iii) employment and decent work [<a href="#R02">2</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e133">‘Livability’ has been proposed as a key concept for city development [<a href="#R03">3</a>], with the underlying assumption that a ‘livable city’ attracts labor force, investors,
                                 innovators and entrepreneurs—those who contribute to the economic growth of cities.
                                 Thus, especially from an economic perspective, livability can be seen as an important
                                 concept. It is inextricably linked to sustainability [<a href="#R04">4</a>], and one may argue that, at least in in an urban context, the two concepts are practically
                                 indistinguishable [<a href="#R05">5</a>]. Nonetheless, livability is a separate and broadly used term; even though it lacks
                                 a precise or generally agreed-upon definition [<a href="#R06">6</a>]. Its meaning remains nebulous with a variety of existing interpretations. One definition
                                 is that livability can be represented by three dimensions relating to human habitation
                                 and well-being, namely ‘suitability’, ‘tolerability’, and ‘functionality’ [<a href="#R04">4</a>]. Alternatively, it specifically relates to those elements of ‘home’, ‘neighborhood’,
                                 and ‘city’ that have to do with safety, economic opportunities and welfare, health,
                                 convenience, mobility, and recreation [<a href="#R07">7</a>]. Another definition describes livability as consisting of four key domains or ‘umbrella’
                                 concepts. These are (i) social development, (ii) environmental sustainability, (iii)
                                 economic performance, and (iv) good governance [<a href="#R08">8</a>], which encompass several inter-related issues [<a href="#R09">9</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e160">The livability of a city generally links strongly to economic conditions at the national
                                 level. During an economic recession, cities may struggle to attract talented human
                                 resources who would increase or maintain their economic attractiveness [<a href="#R03">3</a>]. On the other hand, economic growth can cause negative consequences as well, such
                                 as environmental degradation and deterioration of living environments. Thus, economic
                                 growth alone is not a sufficient requisite for the achievement of livability. Other
                                 dimensions of the economy are equally important in enhancing quality of life and making
                                 cities more livable [<a href="#R06">6</a>]. Recognition of such complexities and a growing interest in the concept have led
                                 to the adoption of various indicator sets in order to measure the livability of cities.
                                 Inevitably, confluence with the development of indicators for urban sustainability
                                 is considerable [<a href="#R10">10</a>]. This study, however, takes its point of departure in schemes that explicitly home
                                 in on livability.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e171">Assuming that resource owners resort to livable city rankings in choosing ‘the best
                                 city’ in which to settle, global competition among cities would occur [<a href="#R11">11</a>], wherein ranking schemes become guiding stars also for public policy- and decision-makers
                                 who strive to make their cities more attractive to globally mobile resources—including
                                 talent, high–net-worth individuals, innovators, entrepreneurs, investors, and capital
                                 [<a href="#R12">12</a>]. Arguably, such a premise represents an intrinsically flawed perspective on decision
                                 making [<a href="#R13">13</a>], which does not mean that it is without significance, neither in the eyes of those
                                 who create rankings, nor to actual outcomes of policies and governance.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e182">One critique to currently used livable city rankings is their extensive use of proxy
                                 indicators, which is due to the unavailability of actual or complementary data [<a href="#R14">14</a>]. In addition, the use of composite indicator schemes, which aim at deriving an integrated
                                 index from a combination of several single measurements using weighting and statistical
                                 methods [<a href="#R15">15</a>], is also criticized as it fails to capture the complex and multidimensional nature
                                 of urban livability. Moreover, this study points out that there are discrepancies
                                 between the state of livability perceived by locals and by external reviewers. This
                                 circumstance is a significant issue since most livable city schemes are created by
                                 actors that are external to the target cities. Typically, existing standardized methods
                                 for measuring urban livability (cf. Section 2 below) have been developed to make comparisons
                                 between different cities and release city rankings, thus failing to capture the contextual

                              <p id="d1e190">Against the backdrop of such critique, in acknowledgement of the fact that each city
                                 is contextually unique, the comparison of different cities by sets of standardized
                                 indicator categories appears to be an inadequate way in which to reflect actual city
                                 livability. Previous studies suggest that indicators of a more descriptive or contextual
                                 kind could provide key insights to city conditions and constitute vital sources of
                                 information for the evaluation of social-ecological issues and economic performance,
                                 as well as for the assessment of needs and resource distribution [<a href="#R16">16</a>, <a href="#R17">17</a>, <a href="#R18">18</a>]. Both context and quality of livability vary from place to place [<a href="#R19">19</a>], yet standardized indicator sets typically only include quantitatively measurable
                                 aspects and fail to incorporate local perceptions and experiences [<a href="#R06">6</a>].

                              <p id="d1e207">Appreciating that livability as a concept is a composite of multiple dimensions, both
                                 quantitative and qualitative, this study follows up on the inadequacies addressed
                                 above and explores a possible way in which to address them. It aims to present how
                                 appreciation of the qualitative dimensions of livability can be developed, and it
                                 does so through an inductive case study on the city of Malmö, Sweden, which provides
                                 an empirical basis for identifying context-specific livability categories. While recognizing
                                 the limitations of case study methodology in research on and development of indicators—for
                                 example with regards to generalization—it seeks to draw on its strengths, including
                                 openness for new patterns to emerge and for old ones to be questioned [<a href="#R20">20</a>].

                              <p id="d1e212">Having elaborated in Section 1 on the concept of livability and its significance to
                                 cities, a theoretical foundation for the study described in this article has been
                                 laid. Section 2 explores existing livable city ranking schemes and provides a point
                                 of reference for efforts to complement them. Section 3 presents the chosen case study
                                 city, reasons for its selection, and the methodology of the empirical study performed,
                                 the outcomes of which are presented in Section 4. These outcomes are subsequently
                                 discussed and elaborated on in Section 5. Section 6 concludes the article with summarizing
                                 notes and messages from the authors.

                                 living conditions are met. To the extent that built, societal and social environments
                                 can affect such aspirations, livable city rankings are meant to capture and reflect
                                 this condition on an aggregated level [<a href="#R05">5</a>]. Table <a href="#Tab1">1</a> presents a selection of nine such rankings that are internationally applied [<a href="#R21">21</a>]

                                 Although there are ranking schemes that create a more holistic and comprehensive measurement
                                 of livability, including City Analysis Methodology (CAM) and UK City Life [<a href="#R22">22</a>], these were not included in Table <a href="#Tab1">1</a> since they are only applied to cities within the UK. CAM is an innovative urban analysis

                                 of livability in UK cities [<a href="#R22">22</a>]. These two schemes show more openness towards the development of a more holistic
                                 approach in measuring urban livability than the international schemes selected for
                                 this study.. Despite the inclusion of many variables, as shown in Table <a href="#Tab1">1</a>, these ranking schemes still fail to adequately illustrate critical dimensions of
                                 urban livability [<a href="#R24">24</a>]. Notably, the livability rankings included here apply standard quantitative measurements
                                 such as annual GDP growth, public infrastructure condition, and educational quality
                                 [<a href="#R21">21</a>]. These types of quantitative data are often readily available and accessible, but
                                 this approach, exclusively focusing on mean or median scores of set indicators to
                                 compare cities [<a href="#R06">6</a>], fails to illustrate the unique characteristics of each city. Furthermore, a closer
                                 look at the lists of indicators reveals that, while most schemes try to be as comprehensive
                                 as possible, others cover only a limited number of categories. One example, where
                                 supposedly significant characteristic have been omitted, is the exclusion of governance
                                 aspects by the Global Power City Index.

                              <p id="d1e263">There is growing recognition that livability attributes vary from place to place,
                                 which has inspired the inclusion of contextually relevant local indicators [<a href="#R19">19</a>], but this trend has only been applied within the transport sector and not to whole
                                 sectors [<a href="#R07">7</a>]. To address this shortcoming, generation of complementary indicators that illustrate
                                 the multiple dimensions of livability is needed [<a href="#R06">6</a>]. In order to distill livability categories to apply as a point of reference in the
                                 study presented in this article, the authors coded and sorted key content—or ‘topics’—in
                                 the descriptions of the nine selected schemes. The result is an amalgamation consisting
                                 of eleven categories. These and their constituent topics are displayed in Table <a href="#Tab2">2</a>.

                                 (Section 3.3).

                                    <p id="d1e494">Malmö is the third most populous city in Sweden with approximately 320,000 inhabitants
                                       [<a href="#R25">25</a>]. Its demographic composition is diverse and young, with 32% of the city’s population
                                       originating in other countries, together representing 170 nationalities, and with
                                       an average age of 38.5 years [<a href="#R26">26</a>]. Located in the southern-most part of Sweden, it is situated adjacent to Denmark’s
                                       capital city of Copenhagen, as depicted in Figure <a href="#Fig1">1</a>. Red lines in Figure <a href="#Fig1">1</a> indicate the coastal line and land border of Sweden. The two cities are physically
                                       linked through a combined bridge and tunnel connection which spans the Öresund Strait.
                                       The map in Figure <a href="#Fig2">2</a> shows the physical plan of the built environment within the municipal boundaries
                                       of the City of Malmö with residential areas marked in red. Socio-economically the
                                       resident distribution has a higher mean income in the western and northern parts of
                                       the city, whereas the eastern and southern parts have a higher proportion of socially
                                       and economically challenged households. Industrial areas flank the city to the north
                                       and to the south, with several old industrial districts in proximity of the city center
                                       being or having been redeveloped into residential areas or mixed urban environments
                                       of residence and business. Current planning priorities prescribe the ongoing expansion
                                       to occur through urban densification within the perimeters of the Outer Ring Road
                                       which circumscribes the city. The oldest parts of urban settlement in Malmö are surrounded
                                       by canals in the city center, just south of the main train station in the old harbor
                                       area. Malmö went through economic recession and depopulation in 1980s, but has since
                                       recovered. Internationally acclaimed and awarded—receiving, for example, a Livable
                                       Communities Award in 2007—it still faces numerous challenges [<a href="#R27">27</a>], and for the purpose of exploring livability indicators it presents an interesting
                                       case.

                                    <p id="d1e538">Malmö provides for an interesting case study for the following two reasons.</p>
                                    <p id="d1e540">Firstly, the city has gone through major transformation in terms of economic structural
                                       changes, successfully recovering from recession and population decline. These recent
                                       economic and demographic developments in Malmö are unique [<a href="#R25">25</a>]. The city first underwent severe hardships following the transformation of local
                                       industries: in the 1970s its population peaked at 266,000 and progressively diminished
                                       to reach merely 229,000 by 1985 due to massive loss of employment opportunities in
                                       shipyard and other manufacturing industries [<a href="#R25">25</a>]. It then managed to radically shift its dependence away from heavy industries to
                                       a wider array of knowledge-based businesses in sectors such as bio-medical science,
                                       environment, IT, digital media, game industry and education [<a href="#R26">26</a>]. Under stable political conditions and unchanging leadership between 1994 and 2013,
                                       ‘work of vision’ largely affected city development and planning including, for example,
                                       the content of successive updates of the city’s Comprehensive Plan [<a href="#R30">30</a>]. These visions, influenced inter alia by the Swedish economist Åke E. Andersson’s
                                       ‘K-society’—based on knowledge (Kunskap), capital (Kapital), communication (Kommunikation),
                                       and culture (Kultur)—set the course toward a more creative and innovative urban fabric
                                       [<a href="#R30">30</a>, <a href="#R31">31</a>]. Additionally, large-scale public investments including financial support from the
                                       national government contributed to the renewal of the city’s built environment, from
                                       old heavy-industrial buildings to other kinds of structures such as eco districts
                                       (for example Augustenborg and Bo01), university buildings, and cultural complexes
                                       (for example Malmö Live) [<a href="#R30">30</a>, <a href="#R31">31</a>]. As a result, Malmö has become a center for employment in innovative and creative
                                       industries and the population has increased rapidly. Current estimates predict that
                                       the total population of Malmö will reach 377,000 by 2025 [<a href="#R26">26</a>].

                                       criteria are evaluated, such as the number of public, health and cultural facilities.
                                       Typically, smaller cities have difficulties in scoring high in such categories due
                                       to the naturally restricted number of people that benefit from these facilities. Imbalances

                                       including linkages to as well as bottlenecks for the enhancement of livability, including
                                       strategies for overcoming challenges. The questions were open-ended to allow for a
                                       more flexible approach in the interviews [<a href="#R33">33</a>]. The interviewees were also encouraged to go beyond the scope of the interviews
                                       and to provide anecdotes about issues they felt are important for a better understanding
                                       of the field [<a href="#R34">34</a>]. All interviews were conducted in English as a working lingua franca, in which respondents
                                       (from Sweden) as well as interviewers (from Japan) are proficient.

                                    <p id="d1e691">Each interview lasted for 60 to 90 minutes. An interview guideline was provided at
                                       the beginning of each interview. All interviews were audiotaped and transcribed. MAXQDA
                                       was used for coding and for visualization analysis, and two of the authors were involved
                                       throughout the whole coding process to ensure the coding integrity. The analysis adopted
                                       a general inductive approach for qualitative data analysis [<a href="#R35">35</a>] which enabled the authors to retrieve categories and topics that describe contextually
                                       relevant livability dimensions. After data cleaning and anonymization, the interview
                                       transcripts were reviewed multiple times to identify through open coding the content
                                       relevant to urban livability. In order to generate categories, relevant words were
                                       first sorted into subgroups in iterative readings of the transcripts, using implicit
                                       meanings as well as explicit words and phrases from the interviews. Next, these groups
                                       were clustered into livability categories. To summarize the result of this coding
                                       analysis, a visualization tool was applied to illustrate the findings, and the authors
                                       selected appropriate quotes that represent the core themes and the essence of each
                                       topic [<a href="#R35">35</a>]. These results are presented in the next section.

                                    <p id="d1e842">Political stability is essential for politicians to be able to make important decisions
                                       (L, Table <a href="#Tab3">3</a>). Committed leadership is also an important feature. When Malmö shifted to a ‘sustainable
                                       city’ from its previous identity as a heavy-industrial city, the mayor at that time
                                       made strong initiatives to bring the city forward. During his time in office, Malmö
                                       became well known for its sustainability efforts [<a href="#R27">27</a>]. Since then, the city has actively taken innovative approaches to achieve and improve
                                       sustainable urban development. An iconic landmark for urban regeneration in Malmö,
                                       originating in that time period, is the Western Harbor district, which showcases the
                                       transformation from a brown-field site, formerly home to an internationally significant
                                       shipyard, to an environmentally high-tech residential area with considerable sustainability
                                       ambitions. In the Western Harbor the then largest collection of energy-efficient buildings
                                       was constructed, and extensive tests of systems for collecting organic waste were
                                       carried out. Malmö addresses different environmental issues simultaneously: for example,
                                       holistic mobility planning including public transport, investments in alternative
                                       fuel vehicles, and bicycle infrastructure [<a href="#R27">27</a>], and the city is internationally acknowledged for its urban planning and sustainable
                                       urban development efforts.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e853">The interviewees often brought up cooperation among city politics and municipal administration.
                                       “The role of politicians is to set goals, but we do not get involved the details,
                                       and leave how we can reach the set goals to the City Office. This communication trust
                                       is important to achieve the goals” (L, Table <a href="#Tab3">3</a>). Malmö showcases how politicians and city officials each play clear roles in achieving
                                       the set goals, and that reciprocal trust between both groups has been a key factor
                                       in the city’s transformation towards a more sustainable city.

                                    <p id="d1e861">In the performed case study, municipal administration relates strongly to politics.
                                       During one of the interviews, it was pointed out that the financial strategy is crucially
                                       important for administration, and that the municipality must diversify its efforts
                                       to use the budget efficiently (D, Table <a href="#Tab3">3</a>). The same informant also reported that the Swedish state railways used to withdraw
                                       more and more due to financial difficulties. In order to find ways of reducing costs,
                                       a division of Malmö’s municipal administration collaborates with publicly owned companies
                                       that are owned by the municipality itself or by another level of government.

                                    <p id="d1e869">Several interviewees mentioned that a ‘compact city’ is a key concept for city planning
                                       in Malmö. The compact city strategy is meant to influence the implementation of transportation
                                       plans and residential development alike. In order to conserve the very fertile farmlands
                                       located outside of Malmö’s built environments, the municipal administration strives
                                       to keep urban facilities and residences inside the Outer Ring Road. A lot of symbolic
                                       architecture and district-based development of the city, including the Western Harbor
                                       and university facilities, are strategically located close to the city center, increasing
                                       its attractiveness—together with measures for increased accessibility and improved
                                       living environments.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e871">One of the main benefits of the compact city strategy mentioned during the interviews
                                       was improved air quality and the reduction of traffic volumes from private cars (L,
                                       Table <a href="#Tab3">3</a>). A significant reduction in infrastructure expenditures was also mentioned as a
                                       benefit of compact city planning. Accordingly, the budget saved from reduced cost
                                       of maintenance and operation of city infrastructure could be invested in the construction
                                       of more educational facilities for the growing population (L, Table <a href="#Tab3">3</a>).

                                    <p id="d1e882">Transportation strongly influences city planning in Malmö because of its significant
                                       social and environmental impacts (e.g. carbon emissions, land price, social cohesion).
                                       Several of the interviewees mentioned the importance of the public transport sector
                                       in social integration. At the time of the case study, there had been a recent workshop
                                       about the social impact of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) which had focused on how public
                                       transportation was being utilized as a tool to improve social integration in socio-economically
                                       challenged parts of the city (I, Table <a href="#Tab3">3</a>).

                                    <p id="d1e890">A reason for Malmö’s population growth in the recent past is the growth of the business
                                       sector. The industrial transformation of the city resulted in the creation of attractive
                                       job opportunities, not least in IT industries. Creative industries such as gaming
                                       and smart phone application developers established their headquarters in the city.
                                       Business development was promoted also by the municipality (A, Table <a href="#Tab3">3</a>). One of the challenges identified in the business category, however, is the decline
                                       of commercial retail businesses in the city center where shop keepers struggle with
                                       competition from renovated or newly established shopping centers in different parts
                                       of the city. “Revitalization of commercial business is a key topic in Malmö nowadays.
                                       There are various attempts on business activation of central areas through collaborative
                                       actions with land owners to create safer and attractive residential and commercial

                                    <p id="d1e901">Human capital also links strongly with the business category in this case study. One
                                       of the topics mentioned by informants in relation to this category was the large number
                                       of foreign immigrants. Malmö was a substantial recipient of migrants during the acute
                                       phases of the refugee and migrant influx into the European Union that culminated in

                                       economic activities and increasing creativity, building cohesion between local residents
                                       and migrants can be challenging. Public consultation to enhance social cohesion between
                                       residents need to be given priority by city officials (B, Table <a href="#Tab3">3</a>).

                                       within this category. These topics connect with socio-economic and ethnic segregation,
                                       as well as with crime. Increasing safety—and thereby the attractiveness of afflicted
                                       areas—is one of the main challenges of the city of Malmö. Provision of affordable
                                       housing, for example for immigrants and other low-income residents, was mentioned
                                       as being an important measure for the improvement of living conditions in the city

                                    <p id="d1e926">Regional integration of Malmö in the cross-boundary Öresund Region of greater Copenhagen
                                       accelerated with the opening in 2000 of the Öresund Bridge that connects the city
                                       to the Danish capital. Transport connectivity has been a key factor for the successes
                                       that this integration has led to. Another important external contributor to Malmö’s
                                       development, especially when it comes to funding, is the European Union. City officials
                                       and politicians alike pointed out that EU funding has made significant facilitating

                                 livable city ranking schemes already in use (cf. Table <a href="#Tab2">2</a>) and context-specific categories of livability identified in a case study of Malmö
                                 (cf. Table <a href="#Tab4">4</a>). Figure <a href="#Fig4">4</a> provides an illustration of these results and also highlights some points for discussion
                                 in the context of prospects for further developments of livability concepts and evaluations
                                 thereof.

                              <p id="d1e963">One notable difference between standardized ranking schemes and the context-specific
                                 categories of livability extracted in this study appears in the domain of the ‘Politics’
                                 category. In standardized schemes, it only captures cities’ performance, political
                                 stability, and political events in relation to other cities. In contrast, the case
                                 study presented here identifies ‘leadership’ as the most influential factor within
                                 the Malmö-specific ‘Politics’ category. Committed leadership enabled the city’s transformation
                                 from a heavy-industrial city to a creative city of knowledge in a relatively short
                                 period of time. Cooperation among city politicians and administrators also appears
                                 as an important function in the category of politics. Well-defined institutional roles
                                 and well-functioning organizations are highlighted as well as the importance of both
                                 kinds of representatives sharing the vision of sustainable development. Stable and
                                 cooperative relations among city officials in Malmö is seen to have generated a positive
                                 cycle of development that attracted competitive human resources into Malmö. Thus,
                                 a localized and Malmö-specific measurement of livability ought to follow up along
                                 these particular dimensions.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e965">Another significant difference relates to transportation. In the categories in Table
                                 <a href="#Tab2">2</a>, transportation falls under physical capital. Among case study respondents, however,
                                 transportation appeared as a distinctly independent and influential Malmö-specific
                                 livability category. Interestingly, transportation was discussed not simply in terms
                                 of its mobility function but as an important way in which to encourage social cohesion
                                 and reduce segregation. Some of Malmö’s residential areas are disproportionately characterized
                                 by higher numbers of socio-economically disadvantaged households and by higher crime
                                 rates. With greater accessibility to mobility options that contribute to the opening
                                 up of these areas, it is hoped that social isolation can be counteracted and that
                                 intermingling among the city’s inhabitants can occur to a greater degree, which would
                                 also help in efforts to mitigate safety encroachments as well as crime in target areas.
                                 The kind of contextualization achieved in this analysis clearly sheds more light on
                                 Malmö’s livability challenges and status than the scores it got for commuting and
                                 travel connectivity in the Teleport Cities ranking scheme.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e970">Moreover, the context-specific category labelled ‘business environment’ that was identified
                                 in this study roughly corresponds to—but presents a narrower focus than—the category
                                 ‘economics’ in the comparative set of existing schemes. Once again, taking Malmö’s
                                 scores in the Teleport Cities ranking as a reference is illuminating. There, Internet
                                 access is one of the measurements used and one where Malmö scores well. In the qualitative
                                 assessment presented here, the importance of this topic is affirmed; it resonates
                                 as a prerequisite for innovative IT industry which receives particular emphasis (cf.
                                 Figure <a href="#Fig3">3</a>). Similarly, the quantitative measurement of venture capital is qualified here in
                                 terms of business support, and both are positively reviewed in Malmö’s case; by the
                                 Teleport Citites ranking and by the case study, respectively.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e975">The use of a qualitative approach and visualization tool in this study makes possible
                                 a closer inspection of the linkages and relations between different livability categories
                                 and topics than what quantitative ranking schemes normally allow for, thus addressing
                                 one of the major limitations of such schemes. The authors believe that the methodology
                                 applied here could be further developed as a way in which to provide context-specific
                                 and qualitative value-added to existing rankings.

                              <p id="d1e1081">Categories used in existing livable city rankings can be complemented by context-specific
                                 livability categories in the examination of the livability of cities, and the inclusion
                                 of qualitative analysis can provide a more comprehensive picture of the situation
                                 in an examined city. Such an approach highlights unique features of the city in question
                                 and can, in a more precise fashion, suggest specific ways in which urban livability
                                 may be enhanced.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e1083">Through the case study of Malmö, nine-context specific livability categories were
                                 identified. The inductive approach used to identify these categories revealed an important
                                 point for further development of livability assessments: a qualitative approach allows
                                 for more in-depth descriptions of livability categories because it can also reveal
                                 the context-specific relationships <i>between</i> categories. Explicit awareness of such relationships can in turn allow city officials
                                 and planners to have a more comprehensive approach when devising strategies to improve
                                 the livability of their cities. Widely used quantitative livability evaluations are
                                 usually performed by persons without previous experience and knowledge of target cities.
                                 In contrast, a qualitative approach enables local people to have a voice in the assessment
                                 of their city’s livability.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e1088">The results and discussions of this study may contribute to the further development
                                 of the livable city concept with the eventual purpose of better reflection of unique
                                 and context-specific features of cities in urban development plans. As the research
                                 presented here is limited to a single case study, further application in other cities
                                 of its inductive approach is needed in order to develop as well as to examine the
                                 limitations or the generalizability of the approach. The method for selection of respondents
                                 as the source for the analysis is one aspect that particularly needs further elaboration.
                                 At any rate, comparisons of the qualitative characteristics of cities could considerably
                                 enrich ongoing discussions on the improvement of existing livability evaluation schemes.

                     <sup>1</sup> Although there are ranking schemes that create a more holistic and comprehensive measurement of livability, including City Analysis Methodology
                     (CAM) and UK City Life [<a href="#R22">22</a>], these were not included in Table 1 since they are only applied to cities within the UK. CAM is an innovative urban
                     analysis framework that aims at providing a holistic evaluation of livability in UK cities with regard to well-being, resource security and CO 2 emissions
                     [<a href="#R23">23</a>]. The UK City Life, similarly, aims at providing a comprehensive and holistic evaluation of livability in UK cities [<a href="#R22">22</a>]. These two schemes show
                     more openness towards the development of a more holistic approach in measuring urban livability than the international schemes selected for this
                     study.
