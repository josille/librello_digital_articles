                  <p class="first" id="d1e110">Livability is a concept being applied to cities, even though it is vague. Worldwide,
                     there are several livable city ranking schemes in use, which compare the livability
                     of cities by making use of standardized indicator sets. The research presented here
                     recognizes, as a point of departure, that each city is unique, implying that comparisons
                     of cities by standardized categories only does not adequately reflect the reality
                     of each city. A qualitative approach to identify context-specific categories of livability
                     is proposed and employed to the case of Malmo ̈ in Sweden. Through interviews, nine
                     context-specific categories were identified and visualized. The findings of the study
                     demonstrate that a qualitative approach enables a more in-depth description of livability
                     categories because it can capture and illustrate relationships among the categories.
                     An explicit awareness of such relationships may provide a more holistic perspective
                     to city officials and planners as they aim to improve the livability of their cities.
                     The study concludes that a qualitative approach in identifying context-specific categories
                     can complement existing assessment schemes and allow a better grasp of livability
                     challenges to cities.

            <p id="d1e125">Cities are widely considered as pivotal actors for sustainable development efforts.
               Goal 11 of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aims at ensuring
               inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable development of urban settlements [<a href="#R01">1</a>], and urbanization can be seen as a positive driver for socio-economic development
               in cities. Some of the benefits it might (but does not necessarily) bring include
               (i) the fostering of human resource development, (ii) improved quality of life for
               dwellers, and (iii) employment and decent work [<a href="#R02">2</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e133">‘Livability’ has been proposed as a key concept for city development [<a href="#R03">3</a>], with the underlying assumption that a ‘livable city’ attracts labor force, investors,
               innovators and entrepreneurs—those who contribute to the economic growth of cities.
               Thus, especially from an economic perspective, livability can be seen as an important
               concept. It is inextricably linked to sustainability [<a href="#R04">4</a>], and one may argue that, at least in in an urban context, the two concepts are practically
               indistinguishable [<a href="#R05">5</a>]. Nonetheless, livability is a separate and broadly used term; even though it lacks
               a precise or generally agreed-upon definition [<a href="#R06">6</a>]. Its meaning remains nebulous with a variety of existing interpretations. One definition
               is that livability can be represented by three dimensions relating to human habitation
               and well-being, namely ‘suitability’, ‘tolerability’, and ‘functionality’ [<a href="#R04">4</a>]. Alternatively, it specifically relates to those elements of ‘home’, ‘neighborhood’,
               and ‘city’ that have to do with safety, economic opportunities and welfare, health,
               convenience, mobility, and recreation [<a href="#R07">7</a>]. Another definition describes livability as consisting of four key domains or ‘umbrella’
               concepts. These are (i) social development, (ii) environmental sustainability, (iii)
               economic performance, and (iv) good governance [<a href="#R08">8</a>], which encompass several inter-related issues [<a href="#R09">9</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e160">The livability of a city generally links strongly to economic conditions at the national
               level. During an economic recession, cities may struggle to attract talented human
               resources who would increase or maintain their economic attractiveness [<a href="#R03">3</a>]. On the other hand, economic growth can cause negative consequences as well, such
               as environmental degradation and deterioration of living environments. Thus, economic
               growth alone is not a sufficient requisite for the achievement of livability. Other
               dimensions of the economy are equally important in enhancing quality of life and making
               cities more livable [<a href="#R06">6</a>]. Recognition of such complexities and a growing interest in the concept have led
               to the adoption of various indicator sets in order to measure the livability of cities.
               Inevitably, confluence with the development of indicators for urban sustainability
               is considerable [<a href="#R10">10</a>]. This study, however, takes its point of departure in schemes that explicitly home
               in on livability.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e171">Assuming that resource owners resort to livable city rankings in choosing ‘the best
               city’ in which to settle, global competition among cities would occur [<a href="#R11">11</a>], wherein ranking schemes become guiding stars also for public policy- and decision-makers
               who strive to make their cities more attractive to globally mobile resources—including
               talent, high–net-worth individuals, innovators, entrepreneurs, investors, and capital
               [<a href="#R12">12</a>]. Arguably, such a premise represents an intrinsically flawed perspective on decision
               making [<a href="#R13">13</a>], which does not mean that it is without significance, neither in the eyes of those
               who create rankings, nor to actual outcomes of policies and governance.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e182">One critique to currently used livable city rankings is their extensive use of proxy
               indicators, which is due to the unavailability of actual or complementary data [<a href="#R14">14</a>]. In addition, the use of composite indicator schemes, which aim at deriving an integrated
               index from a combination of several single measurements using weighting and statistical
               methods [<a href="#R15">15</a>], is also criticized as it fails to capture the complex and multidimensional nature
               of urban livability. Moreover, this study points out that there are discrepancies
               between the state of livability perceived by locals and by external reviewers. This
               circumstance is a significant issue since most livable city schemes are created by
               actors that are external to the target cities. Typically, existing standardized methods
               for measuring urban livability (cf. Section 2 below) have been developed to make comparisons
               between different cities and release city rankings, thus failing to capture the contextual
               and qualitative uniqueness of each city.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e190">Against the backdrop of such critique, in acknowledgement of the fact that each city
               is contextually unique, the comparison of different cities by sets of standardized
               indicator categories appears to be an inadequate way in which to reflect actual city
               livability. Previous studies suggest that indicators of a more descriptive or contextual
               kind could provide key insights to city conditions and constitute vital sources of
               information for the evaluation of social-ecological issues and economic performance,
               as well as for the assessment of needs and resource distribution [<a href="#R16">16</a>, <a href="#R17">17</a>, <a href="#R18">18</a>]. Both context and quality of livability vary from place to place [<a href="#R19">19</a>], yet standardized indicator sets typically only include quantitatively measurable
               aspects and fail to incorporate local perceptions and experiences [<a href="#R06">6</a>].
               
            </p>
            <p id="d1e207">Appreciating that livability as a concept is a composite of multiple dimensions, both
               quantitative and qualitative, this study follows up on the inadequacies addressed
               above and explores a possible way in which to address them. It aims to present how
               appreciation of the qualitative dimensions of livability can be developed, and it
               does so through an inductive case study on the city of Malmö, Sweden, which provides
               an empirical basis for identifying context-specific livability categories. While recognizing
               the limitations of case study methodology in research on and development of indicators—for
               example with regards to generalization—it seeks to draw on its strengths, including
               openness for new patterns to emerge and for old ones to be questioned [<a href="#R20">20</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e212">Having elaborated in Section 1 on the concept of livability and its significance to
               cities, a theoretical foundation for the study described in this article has been
               laid. Section 2 explores existing livable city ranking schemes and provides a point
               of reference for efforts to complement them. Section 3 presents the chosen case study
               city, reasons for its selection, and the methodology of the empirical study performed,
               the outcomes of which are presented in Section 4. These outcomes are subsequently
               discussed and elaborated on in Section 5. Section 6 concludes the article with summarizing
               notes and messages from the authors.

            <p id="d1e217">Livability can be described as a measure of whether people’s aspirations of basic
               living conditions are met. To the extent that built, societal and social environments
               can affect such aspirations, livable city rankings are meant to capture and reflect

               Although there are ranking schemes that create a more holistic and comprehensive measurement
               of livability, including City Analysis Methodology (CAM) and UK City Life [<a href="#R22">22</a>], these were not included in Table <a href="#Tab1">1</a> since they are only applied to cities within the UK. CAM is an innovative urban analysis
               framework that aims at providing a holistic evaluation of livability in UK cities
               with regard to well-being, resource security and CO<span class="inline-formula">

               of livability in UK cities [<a href="#R22">22</a>]. These two schemes show more openness towards the development of a more holistic
               approach in measuring urban livability than the international schemes selected for
               this study.. Despite the inclusion of many variables, as shown in Table <a href="#Tab1">1</a>, these ranking schemes still fail to adequately illustrate critical dimensions of
               urban livability [<a href="#R24">24</a>]. Notably, the livability rankings included here apply standard quantitative measurements
               such as annual GDP growth, public infrastructure condition, and educational quality
               [<a href="#R21">21</a>]. These types of quantitative data are often readily available and accessible, but
               this approach, exclusively focusing on mean or median scores of set indicators to
               compare cities [<a href="#R06">6</a>], fails to illustrate the unique characteristics of each city. Furthermore, a closer
               look at the lists of indicators reveals that, while most schemes try to be as comprehensive
               as possible, others cover only a limited number of categories. One example, where
               supposedly significant characteristic have been omitted, is the exclusion of governance
               aspects by the Global Power City Index.

            <p id="d1e263">There is growing recognition that livability attributes vary from place to place,
               which has inspired the inclusion of contextually relevant local indicators [<a href="#R19">19</a>], but this trend has only been applied within the transport sector and not to whole
               sectors [<a href="#R07">7</a>]. To address this shortcoming, generation of complementary indicators that illustrate
               the multiple dimensions of livability is needed [<a href="#R06">6</a>]. In order to distill livability categories to apply as a point of reference in the
               study presented in this article, the authors coded and sorted key content—or ‘topics’—in
               the descriptions of the nine selected schemes. The result is an amalgamation consisting
               of eleven categories. These and their constituent topics are displayed in Table <a href="#Tab2">2</a>.

               generating contextually relevant local livability indicators. The empirical information
               was collected in a case study performed in 2016 in Malmö, Sweden, as described below
               (Section 3.3).

               <p id="d1e494">Malmö is the third most populous city in Sweden with approximately 320,000 inhabitants
                  [<a href="#R25">25</a>]. Its demographic composition is diverse and young, with 32% of the city’s population
                  originating in other countries, together representing 170 nationalities, and with
                  an average age of 38.5 years [<a href="#R26">26</a>]. Located in the southern-most part of Sweden, it is situated adjacent to Denmark’s
                  capital city of Copenhagen, as depicted in Figure <a href="#Fig1">1</a>. Red lines in Figure <a href="#Fig1">1</a> indicate the coastal line and land border of Sweden. The two cities are physically
                  linked through a combined bridge and tunnel connection which spans the Öresund Strait.
                  The map in Figure <a href="#Fig2">2</a> shows the physical plan of the built environment within the municipal boundaries
                  of the City of Malmö with residential areas marked in red. Socio-economically the
                  resident distribution has a higher mean income in the western and northern parts of
                  the city, whereas the eastern and southern parts have a higher proportion of socially
                  and economically challenged households. Industrial areas flank the city to the north
                  and to the south, with several old industrial districts in proximity of the city center
                  being or having been redeveloped into residential areas or mixed urban environments
                  of residence and business. Current planning priorities prescribe the ongoing expansion
                  to occur through urban densification within the perimeters of the Outer Ring Road
                  which circumscribes the city. The oldest parts of urban settlement in Malmö are surrounded
                  by canals in the city center, just south of the main train station in the old harbor
                  area. Malmö went through economic recession and depopulation in 1980s, but has since
                  recovered. Internationally acclaimed and awarded—receiving, for example, a Livable
                  Communities Award in 2007—it still faces numerous challenges [<a href="#R27">27</a>], and for the purpose of exploring livability indicators it presents an interesting
                  case.

                  <!-- named anchor --></a><h3 class="section-title">3.2.- Malmö’s Relevance as a Case for Studying Livability</h3>
               <p id="d1e538">Malmö provides for an interesting case study for the following two reasons.</p>
               <p id="d1e540">Firstly, the city has gone through major transformation in terms of economic structural
                  changes, successfully recovering from recession and population decline. These recent
                  economic and demographic developments in Malmö are unique [<a href="#R25">25</a>]. The city first underwent severe hardships following the transformation of local
                  industries: in the 1970s its population peaked at 266,000 and progressively diminished
                  to reach merely 229,000 by 1985 due to massive loss of employment opportunities in
                  shipyard and other manufacturing industries [<a href="#R25">25</a>]. It then managed to radically shift its dependence away from heavy industries to
                  a wider array of knowledge-based businesses in sectors such as bio-medical science,
                  environment, IT, digital media, game industry and education [<a href="#R26">26</a>]. Under stable political conditions and unchanging leadership between 1994 and 2013,
                  ‘work of vision’ largely affected city development and planning including, for example,
                  the content of successive updates of the city’s Comprehensive Plan [<a href="#R30">30</a>]. These visions, influenced inter alia by the Swedish economist Åke E. Andersson’s
                  ‘K-society’—based on knowledge (Kunskap), capital (Kapital), communication (Kommunikation),
                  and culture (Kultur)—set the course toward a more creative and innovative urban fabric
                  [<a href="#R30">30</a>, <a href="#R31">31</a>]. Additionally, large-scale public investments including financial support from the
                  national government contributed to the renewal of the city’s built environment, from
                  old heavy-industrial buildings to other kinds of structures such as eco districts
                  (for example Augustenborg and Bo01), university buildings, and cultural complexes
                  (for example Malmö Live) [<a href="#R30">30</a>, <a href="#R31">31</a>]. As a result, Malmö has become a center for employment in innovative and creative
                  industries and the population has increased rapidly. Current estimates predict that
                  the total population of Malmö will reach 377,000 by 2025 [<a href="#R26">26</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e570">Secondly, although Malmö is too small, even with forecasted growth, for the majority
                  of livable city ranking schemes, it does feature as a target city included by the
                  set of schemes in Table <a href="#Tab1">1</a>. Existing rankings generally focus only on more populous cities, with the exception,
                  however, of Mercer’s Quality of Life (QoL) ranking and the Teleport Cities ranking
                  by Topia. The latter rates 266 cities including Malmö, evaluating it as one of its
                  top cities within business freedom (9<span class="inline-formula">

                  criteria are evaluated, such as the number of public, health and cultural facilities.
                  Typically, smaller cities have difficulties in scoring high in such categories due
                  to the naturally restricted number of people that benefit from these facilities. Imbalances
                  of this kind provide further argumentation for the need to generate contextually relevant
                  indicator schemes. Smaller cities are no more or less in need of improved urban livability
                  and sustainability than metropolitan cites, and they should have the opportunity of
                  appropriate evaluation regardless of their size.

               <p id="d1e680">In order to identify context-specific livability categories for Malmö, 10 semi-structured
                  interviews were conducted in the latter half of 2016 with local experts in the field
                  of urban development and planning. Details regarding the interviewees, who were selected
                  through a snowballing approach, are shown in Table <a href="#Tab3">3</a>. The questions asked focused on identifying qualitative dimensions of livability,
                  including linkages to as well as bottlenecks for the enhancement of livability, including
                  strategies for overcoming challenges. The questions were open-ended to allow for a
                  more flexible approach in the interviews [<a href="#R33">33</a>]. The interviewees were also encouraged to go beyond the scope of the interviews
                  and to provide anecdotes about issues they felt are important for a better understanding
                  of the field [<a href="#R34">34</a>]. All interviews were conducted in English as a working lingua franca, in which respondents
                  (from Sweden) as well as interviewers (from Japan) are proficient.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e691">Each interview lasted for 60 to 90 minutes. An interview guideline was provided at
                  the beginning of each interview. All interviews were audiotaped and transcribed. MAXQDA
                  was used for coding and for visualization analysis, and two of the authors were involved
                  throughout the whole coding process to ensure the coding integrity. The analysis adopted
                  a general inductive approach for qualitative data analysis [<a href="#R35">35</a>] which enabled the authors to retrieve categories and topics that describe contextually
                  relevant livability dimensions. After data cleaning and anonymization, the interview
                  transcripts were reviewed multiple times to identify through open coding the content
                  relevant to urban livability. In order to generate categories, relevant words were
                  first sorted into subgroups in iterative readings of the transcripts, using implicit
                  meanings as well as explicit words and phrases from the interviews. Next, these groups
                  were clustered into livability categories. To summarize the result of this coding
                  analysis, a visualization tool was applied to illustrate the findings, and the authors
                  selected appropriate quotes that represent the core themes and the essence of each
                  topic [<a href="#R35">35</a>]. These results are presented in the next section.

               <p id="d1e842">Political stability is essential for politicians to be able to make important decisions
                  (L, Table <a href="#Tab3">3</a>). Committed leadership is also an important feature. When Malmö shifted to a ‘sustainable
                  city’ from its previous identity as a heavy-industrial city, the mayor at that time
                  made strong initiatives to bring the city forward. During his time in office, Malmö
                  became well known for its sustainability efforts [<a href="#R27">27</a>]. Since then, the city has actively taken innovative approaches to achieve and improve
                  sustainable urban development. An iconic landmark for urban regeneration in Malmö,
                  originating in that time period, is the Western Harbor district, which showcases the
                  transformation from a brown-field site, formerly home to an internationally significant
                  shipyard, to an environmentally high-tech residential area with considerable sustainability
                  ambitions. In the Western Harbor the then largest collection of energy-efficient buildings
                  was constructed, and extensive tests of systems for collecting organic waste were
                  carried out. Malmö addresses different environmental issues simultaneously: for example,
                  holistic mobility planning including public transport, investments in alternative
                  fuel vehicles, and bicycle infrastructure [<a href="#R27">27</a>], and the city is internationally acknowledged for its urban planning and sustainable
                  urban development efforts.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e853">The interviewees often brought up cooperation among city politics and municipal administration.
                  “The role of politicians is to set goals, but we do not get involved the details,
                  and leave how we can reach the set goals to the City Office. This communication trust
                  is important to achieve the goals” (L, Table <a href="#Tab3">3</a>). Malmö showcases how politicians and city officials each play clear roles in achieving
                  the set goals, and that reciprocal trust between both groups has been a key factor
                  in the city’s transformation towards a more sustainable city.

               <p id="d1e861">In the performed case study, municipal administration relates strongly to politics.
                  During one of the interviews, it was pointed out that the financial strategy is crucially
                  important for administration, and that the municipality must diversify its efforts
                  to use the budget efficiently (D, Table <a href="#Tab3">3</a>). The same informant also reported that the Swedish state railways used to withdraw
                  more and more due to financial difficulties. In order to find ways of reducing costs,
                  a division of Malmö’s municipal administration collaborates with publicly owned companies
                  that are owned by the municipality itself or by another level of government.

               <p id="d1e869">Several interviewees mentioned that a ‘compact city’ is a key concept for city planning
                  in Malmö. The compact city strategy is meant to influence the implementation of transportation
                  plans and residential development alike. In order to conserve the very fertile farmlands
                  located outside of Malmö’s built environments, the municipal administration strives
                  to keep urban facilities and residences inside the Outer Ring Road. A lot of symbolic
                  architecture and district-based development of the city, including the Western Harbor
                  and university facilities, are strategically located close to the city center, increasing
                  its attractiveness—together with measures for increased accessibility and improved
                  living environments.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e871">One of the main benefits of the compact city strategy mentioned during the interviews
                  was improved air quality and the reduction of traffic volumes from private cars (L,
                  Table <a href="#Tab3">3</a>). A significant reduction in infrastructure expenditures was also mentioned as a
                  benefit of compact city planning. Accordingly, the budget saved from reduced cost
                  of maintenance and operation of city infrastructure could be invested in the construction
                  of more educational facilities for the growing population (L, Table <a href="#Tab3">3</a>).

               <p id="d1e882">Transportation strongly influences city planning in Malmö because of its significant
                  social and environmental impacts (e.g. carbon emissions, land price, social cohesion).
                  Several of the interviewees mentioned the importance of the public transport sector
                  in social integration. At the time of the case study, there had been a recent workshop
                  about the social impact of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) which had focused on how public
                  transportation was being utilized as a tool to improve social integration in socio-economically
                  challenged parts of the city (I, Table <a href="#Tab3">3</a>).

               <p id="d1e890">A reason for Malmö’s population growth in the recent past is the growth of the business
                  sector. The industrial transformation of the city resulted in the creation of attractive
                  job opportunities, not least in IT industries. Creative industries such as gaming
                  and smart phone application developers established their headquarters in the city.
                  Business development was promoted also by the municipality (A, Table <a href="#Tab3">3</a>). One of the challenges identified in the business category, however, is the decline
                  of commercial retail businesses in the city center where shop keepers struggle with
                  competition from renovated or newly established shopping centers in different parts
                  of the city. “Revitalization of commercial business is a key topic in Malmö nowadays.
                  There are various attempts on business activation of central areas through collaborative
                  actions with land owners to create safer and attractive residential and commercial
                  areas” (L, Table <a href="#Tab3">3</a>).

               <p id="d1e901">Human capital also links strongly with the business category in this case study. One
                  of the topics mentioned by informants in relation to this category was the large number
                  of foreign immigrants. Malmö was a substantial recipient of migrants during the acute
                  phases of the refugee and migrant influx into the European Union that culminated in
                  2015. While locals acknowledge that immigration can be a positive driver for activating
                  economic activities and increasing creativity, building cohesion between local residents
                  and migrants can be challenging. Public consultation to enhance social cohesion between
                  residents need to be given priority by city officials (B, Table <a href="#Tab3">3</a>).

               <p id="d1e909">Safety and land value were the prominent topics discussed by case study informants
                  within this category. These topics connect with socio-economic and ethnic segregation,
                  as well as with crime. Increasing safety—and thereby the attractiveness of afflicted
                  areas—is one of the main challenges of the city of Malmö. Provision of affordable
                  housing, for example for immigrants and other low-income residents, was mentioned
                  as being an important measure for the improvement of living conditions in the city
                  (B, Table <a href="#Tab3">3</a>).

                  that this integration has led to. Another important external contributor to Malmö’s
                  development, especially when it comes to funding, is the European Union. City officials
                  and politicians alike pointed out that EU funding has made significant facilitating
                  contributions to the municipal budget (L, Table <a href="#Tab3">3</a>).

               <p id="d1e934">Table <a href="#Tab4">4</a> summarizes the content above. The nine context-specific categories identified in
                  this study allow for a more in-depth look at factors that affect the livability of
                  Malmö from the perspective of local persons as presented in Table <a href="#Tab3">3</a>. The factors identified cannot be fully explained or represented by quantitative
                  categories alone, but this research provides clues for how and where to look for contextually
                  appropriate and qualitative indicators for Malmö, thereby increasing the comprehensiveness
                  of livability measurements.

               <p id="d1e942">In Table <a href="#Tab4">4</a>, the column titled ‘Topics covered in Malmö’ contains details needed to delve further
                  into the uniquely Malmö-specific conditions, whereas the headlines used in the ‘Category’
                  column could also be more generally assigned and interpreted. Still, it should be
                  noted that these categories are context-specific as they reflect the characteristics
                  identified in this particular study, and that other studies in other cities may lead
                  to a different set of categories.

               <p id="d1e947">In the following section the results presented here will be discussed in relation
                  to existing standardized schemes for evaluations of livability in cities.

               <!-- named anchor --></a><h2 class="main-title">5.- Discussion</h2>
            <p id="d1e952">This study identifies differences and similarities between categories used in quantitative
               livable city ranking schemes already in use (cf. Table <a href="#Tab2">2</a>) and context-specific categories of livability identified in a case study of Malmö
               (cf. Table <a href="#Tab4">4</a>). Figure <a href="#Fig4">4</a> provides an illustration of these results and also highlights some points for discussion
               in the context of prospects for further developments of livability concepts and evaluations
               thereof.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e963">One notable difference between standardized ranking schemes and the context-specific
               categories of livability extracted in this study appears in the domain of the ‘Politics’
               category. In standardized schemes, it only captures cities’ performance, political
               stability, and political events in relation to other cities. In contrast, the case
               study presented here identifies ‘leadership’ as the most influential factor within
               the Malmö-specific ‘Politics’ category. Committed leadership enabled the city’s transformation
               from a heavy-industrial city to a creative city of knowledge in a relatively short
               period of time. Cooperation among city politicians and administrators also appears
               as an important function in the category of politics. Well-defined institutional roles
               and well-functioning organizations are highlighted as well as the importance of both
               kinds of representatives sharing the vision of sustainable development. Stable and
               cooperative relations among city officials in Malmö is seen to have generated a positive
               cycle of development that attracted competitive human resources into Malmö. Thus,
               a localized and Malmö-specific measurement of livability ought to follow up along
               these particular dimensions.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e965">Another significant difference relates to transportation. In the categories in Table
               <a href="#Tab2">2</a>, transportation falls under physical capital. Among case study respondents, however,
               transportation appeared as a distinctly independent and influential Malmö-specific
               livability category. Interestingly, transportation was discussed not simply in terms
               of its mobility function but as an important way in which to encourage social cohesion
               and reduce segregation. Some of Malmö’s residential areas are disproportionately characterized
               by higher numbers of socio-economically disadvantaged households and by higher crime
               rates. With greater accessibility to mobility options that contribute to the opening
               up of these areas, it is hoped that social isolation can be counteracted and that
               intermingling among the city’s inhabitants can occur to a greater degree, which would
               also help in efforts to mitigate safety encroachments as well as crime in target areas.
               The kind of contextualization achieved in this analysis clearly sheds more light on
               Malmö’s livability challenges and status than the scores it got for commuting and
               travel connectivity in the Teleport Cities ranking scheme.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e970">Moreover, the context-specific category labelled ‘business environment’ that was identified
               in this study roughly corresponds to—but presents a narrower focus than—the category
               ‘economics’ in the comparative set of existing schemes. Once again, taking Malmö’s
               scores in the Teleport Cities ranking as a reference is illuminating. There, Internet
               access is one of the measurements used and one where Malmö scores well. In the qualitative
               assessment presented here, the importance of this topic is affirmed; it resonates
               as a prerequisite for innovative IT industry which receives particular emphasis (cf.
               Figure <a href="#Fig3">3</a>). Similarly, the quantitative measurement of venture capital is qualified here in
               terms of business support, and both are positively reviewed in Malmö’s case; by the
               Teleport Citites ranking and by the case study, respectively.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e975">The use of a qualitative approach and visualization tool in this study makes possible
               a closer inspection of the linkages and relations between different livability categories
               and topics than what quantitative ranking schemes normally allow for, thus addressing
               one of the major limitations of such schemes. The authors believe that the methodology
               applied here could be further developed as a way in which to provide context-specific
               and qualitative value-added to existing rankings.

            <p id="d1e1081">Categories used in existing livable city rankings can be complemented by context-specific
               livability categories in the examination of the livability of cities, and the inclusion
               of qualitative analysis can provide a more comprehensive picture of the situation
               in an examined city. Such an approach highlights unique features of the city in question
               and can, in a more precise fashion, suggest specific ways in which urban livability
               may be enhanced.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e1083">Through the case study of Malmö, nine-context specific livability categories were
               identified. The inductive approach used to identify these categories revealed an important
               point for further development of livability assessments: a qualitative approach allows
               for more in-depth descriptions of livability categories because it can also reveal
               the context-specific relationships <i>between</i> categories. Explicit awareness of such relationships can in turn allow city officials
               and planners to have a more comprehensive approach when devising strategies to improve
               the livability of their cities. Widely used quantitative livability evaluations are
               usually performed by persons without previous experience and knowledge of target cities.
               In contrast, a qualitative approach enables local people to have a voice in the assessment
               of their city’s livability.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e1088">The results and discussions of this study may contribute to the further development
               of the livable city concept with the eventual purpose of better reflection of unique
               and context-specific features of cities in urban development plans. As the research
               presented here is limited to a single case study, further application in other cities
               of its inductive approach is needed in order to develop as well as to examine the
               limitations or the generalizability of the approach. The method for selection of respondents
               as the source for the analysis is one aspect that particularly needs further elaboration.
               At any rate, comparisons of the qualitative characteristics of cities could considerably
               enrich ongoing discussions on the improvement of existing livability evaluation schemes.
