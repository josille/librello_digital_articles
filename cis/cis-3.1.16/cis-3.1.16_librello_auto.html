                                 The globe’s first carbon projects were designed and implemented approximately 20 years ago following scientific
                                 insights that emissions of greenhouse gases needed to be
                                 mitigated. Visible in some of these early projects were the
                                 important aspects of social governance and local benefit
                                 sharing. The projects promised to be a panacea to environmental, social and economic problems in remote rural
                                 areas of developing countries. However, it took another
                                 decade before a wave of hundreds of carbon projects were
                                 launched. Many of the projects were offered under the
                                 mechanism of REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation, plus the role of 
                                 conservation, sustainable forest management and carbon enhancement), as well as under a variety of voluntary schemes
                                 and national programs, public-private partnerships, and
                                 forestry-based investment initiatives. As decision-makers
                                 prepare the Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climatic Change in Paris
                                 (COP21), Earthscan has released a book entitled ‘Carbon
                                 conflicts and forest landscapes in Africa’, edited by Melissa
                                 Leach and Ian Scoones. According to the editors, the focus of the book is on what happens on the ground when
                                 carbon forestry projects arrive, what types of projects work,
                                 and, equally important, what doesn’t work.

                                 Leach and Scoones launch the collection of ten chapters with a discussion of “political ecologies of carbon in
                                 Africa”. This is followed by a review of different carbon
                                 projects and policies. Finally, a variety of case studies
                                 are presented, concentrating on Ghana, Kenya, Sierra
                                 Leone, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe, clearly
                                 achieving a broad representation of different African 
                                 socioecological and political contexts. Adding to the geographical diversity, the contributing authors also represent a
                                 variety of academic perspectives, including 
                                 anthropologists, geographers, economists, natural resource 
                                 managers, agronomists, and social scientists. This broad spectrum makes clear that the reader should not expect strict
                                 assessments of carbon project impacts on forest 
                                 ecosystems or biodiversity in general. Lacking in the book, 
                                 however, are contributions and perspectives from ‘climate 
                                 protectionists’, conservationists, carbon brokers, or donors of
                                 carbon projects, which would have made the book more
                                 comprehensive and balanced.

                                 This piece of work is a critical revision of carbon
                                 projects as economic interventions that provide new value
                                 to ecosystems suffering from unsustainable use. Due to
                                 their economic relevance they have even become an 
                                 interesting object for brokers, traders, and consultants and
                                 often developed a certain potential to create social distortions on the ground. The editors present and discuss “a
                                 new round of ‘missionary’ development activity” advocated
                                 by donors and NGOs. Indeed, carbon projects are just
                                 another form of socioeconomic and legal mechanisms—
                                 paid for significantly by foreign donations—that can alter
                                 or restrict access to local natural resources and 
                                 potentially change local livelihoods. They represent interventions in extremely complex socio-ecological and political
                                 landscapes of forestry/ecosystem management, where 
                                 unsatisfied needs of local people combine with governance
                                 and enforcement deficits. The projects are stacked on top
                                 of many layers of conventional development projects and
                                 cannot escape their socio-cultural and historical contexts,
                                 or the standard problems related to the mobilization and
                                 engagement of local actors. In this context, also due to
                                 their design that differs from conventional projects, “carbon
                                 projects face a greater challenge in explaining themselves”
                                 (Mickels-Kokwe and Kokwe, p. 140).

                                 The two introductory chapters alone are a valuable
                                 compilation of facts about carbon projects, their 
                                 technicalities, and their political ecology. The chapters’ relevance goes far beyond the African context. Furthermore,
                                 they are meaningful in a broader context of a neoliberal
                                 and commodified model of ecosystem management, which
                                 is currently expanding and diversifying. The case studies compile a compelling amount of evidence of failures
                                 and conflicts. They also give voice to local stakeholders
                                 reflecting their perceptions of carbon projects, regarding
                                 both design and implementation. As the editors point out,
                                 the authors do not go as far as simply rejecting carbon
                                 projects. The reader who examines this book closely can
                                 come to conclusions that are grim and depressing: Carbon
                                 projects often stand for big promises and poor delivery, for
                                 high expectations that fail to match rigorous requirements,
                                 for gaining carbon finance, for ‘fortress conservation’ that
                                 forcefully excludes local people, sidelining farmers’ knowledge, for the displacement of food production as well as
                                 for benefits limited to old or new elites, just to summarize a few findings presented in the book. Indeed, it is
                                 disheartening to find so much evidence of missed opportunities and failure after so many years of implementing
                                 carbon projects. These seem to have significantly contributed to the credibility crisis of biodiversity conservation
                                 and ecosystem management; the concept of ‘big carbon
                                 money’ may have both corrupted and oversimplified the
                                 narrative of an ethically needed conservation.

                                 Science seems to show that “smallholders are not a
                                 significant cause but rather a significant victim of climate
                                 change. Therefore, social justice calls for compensation,
                                 rather than making them bear the costs of mitigation programmes” (Atela, p. 92). At the end of the day, carbon
                                 projects contribute to the commodification of the irreplaceable 
                                 fundaments of our life, fueling an ongoing privatization
                                 of ecosystem management and governance. They further

                                 The need for the conservation of functional and intact
                                 forests is undeniable and non-negotiable. But if carbon
                                 projects failed to enable and empower local actors and
                                 adequately compensate them for unavoidable opportunity
                                 costs, all this that once started as an apparently good idea
                                 has not just led to disappointment, but has become part
                                 of the problem. It is recommendable to carefully study
                                 this trend towards a flow-based governance of commodified carbon and biomass. Much more is to come under the
                                 rising paradigm of bioeconomy and a complexifying ‘green
                                 grabbing scenario’. In this context, this book is a very 
                                 valuable source. It gives important recommendations for the incremental improvement of carbon projects including pleas
                                 for taking social justice and equity seriously. Equally 
                                 important, it provides tangible arguments for pressing the ‘reset button’ in forest carbon governance. Game over? Is it
                                 time for decarbonization of conservation and development
                                 projects? This book should also inspire further critical 
                                 inquiry that helps us to competently question ‘greened’ neoliberal approaches to ecosystem management and avoid
                                 further sidetracks and traps that distract us from real sustainable development.
