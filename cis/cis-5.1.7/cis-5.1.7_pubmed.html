                  <p class="first" id="d1e93">Indigenous knowledge (IK) is now recognized as being critical to the development of
                     effective, equitable and meaningful strategies to address socio-ecological crises.
                     However efforts to integrate IK and Western science frequently encounter difficulties
                     due to different systems of knowledge production and underlying worldviews. New approaches
                     are needed so that sustainability can progress on the terms that matter the most for
                     the people involved. In this paper we discuss a case study from Aotearoa New Zealand
                     where an indigenous community is in the process of renegotiating and enacting new
                     indigenous-led approaches to address coupled socio-ecological crises. We reflect on
                     novel methodological approaches that highlight the ways in which projects/knowledge
                     are co-produced by a multiplicity of human and non-human actors. To this end we draw
                     on conceptualizations of environmental ethics offered by indigenous scholars and propose
                     alternative bodies of thought, methods, and practices that can support the wider sustainability
                     agenda.

            <p id="d1e112">Globally, researchers and policy makers are increasingly recognizing the importance
               of Indigenous Knowledge (IK) in the development and implementation of policies and
               management approaches 
               [
               <a href="#R01">1</a>
               ]
               . The recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report
               signals this importance of IK as a building block of human security in stating that
               there is a high likelihood and robust evidence to demonstrate that “indigenous, local
               and traditional forms of knowledge are a major resource for adapting to climate change”
               (
               [
               <a href="#R02">2</a>
               ]
               , p. 758). The integration of such bottom-up place-based knowledge with science is
               hoped to promote more robust approaches in increasing community resilience, adaptation,
               sustainability, and disaster preparedness 
               [
               <a href="#R03">3</a>
               ]
               . This is based on the premise that the integration of scientific and other knowledge
               systems can “lead to a more effective interface between science, policy and society”
               (
               [
               <a href="#R04">4</a>
               ]
               , p. 4). We argue that the transdisciplinary nature of sustainability science has
               the potential to examine the world through a more holistic approach, something that
               is often associated with indigenous groups' way of viewing the world. In this paper,
               our main aim is to discuss the range of challenges regarding integration, the ways
               IK is currently understood and researched, and the need for recognition of historical
               ideologies and processes, particularly in relation to matters of equity, accountability
               and fairness in indigenous- related research.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e126">The interest in IK has partly emerged through decades of `failed' development and
               the recognition that participatory, locally-led and locally-informed processes are
               more attuned to indigenous groups' priorities and aspirations  
               [
               <a href="#R01">1</a>
               ]
               . Attempts to integrate IK with Western scientific knowledge often struggle, however,
               due to the problematic treatment of IK by scholars. The dominant framing of IK is
               as a complementary source of knowledge to (Western) science, which can be used to
               augment empirical data on local environmental conditions including the status of biodiversity
               
               [
               <a href="#R05">5</a>
               ]
               , impacts of climate variability and change 
               [
               <a href="#R06">6</a>, <a href="#R07">7</a>
               ]
               , and frequency of hazards 
               [
               <a href="#R08">8</a>, <a href="#R09">9</a>, <a href="#R10">10</a>
               ]
               . This is problematic because it positions scientific knowledge as objective, rational,
               and universal and IK as highly situated, specific, embedded, and subjective. Thus
               scholars criticize Indigenous Knowledge-holders for having “inaccurate and poor conception…of
               past ecosystems and the changes undergone in their surrounding environment” (
               [
               <a href="#R05">5</a>
               ]
               , p. 279), without acknowledging, for instance, the impacts of colonization and globalization
               on IK traditions. There is also little appreciation or questioning of the knowledge
               base/roots where Western science and colonialism originated from, with their conceptual
               roots in European local histories that have became globally applied 
               [
               <a href="#R11">11</a>
               ]
               .
               
            </p>
            <p id="d1e156">Instead of direct comparisons with Western scientific knowledge, IK systems should
               be viewed as different but nevertheless equally valid ways of understanding the world
               
               [
               <a href="#R12">12</a>
               ]
               . IK systems can be defined as “the combination of knowledge systems encompassing
               technology, social, economic, and philosophical learning, or education, legal and
               governance systems” (
               [
               <a href="#R13">13</a>
               ]
               , p. 8). Indigenous approaches therefore use, for example, reciprocity as part of
               the process in responding to social problems and perceive themselves as “respectful
               partners in genealogical relationships of interconnected humans, non-human beings,
               entities and collectives who have reciprocal responsibilities to one another” (
               [
               <a href="#R14">14</a>
               ]
               , p. 25; Figure <a href="#Fig01">1</a>). Greater appreciation and consideration of IK is crucial if sustainability science
               is to encapsulate and build upon people’s values and worldviews in a meaningful manner

            <p id="d1e189">While it is outside the scope of this paper to provide a review of the definitional
               differences, sustainability is broadly defined by scholars in terms of the themes
               of interconnection of the social, economic, and environmental domains and intergenerational
               resource usage and requirements. Cutter (
               [
               <a href="#R17">17</a>
               ]
               , p. 73) defines sustainability as “the potential to maintain the long term well-being
               of communities based on social, economic, and environmental requirements of present
               and future generations” (
               [
               <a href="#R17">17</a>
               ]
               , p. 73). One of the challenges for sustainability science is to diversify the meaning
               of sustainability and well-being, which so far have been reliant on measures such
               as GDP. The incorporation of indigenous conceptualizations of well-being and sustainability,
               and their inclusion as driving values in policy and research, potentially offer a
               more inclusive platform for an enriched conversation as to what the goals and outcomes
               should be and why. This is crucial given that issues of equity and fairness are at
               the core of any discussion on sustainability 
               [
               <a href="#R18">18</a>
               ]
               . Moreover, an increase in `reflexive science' 
               [
               <a href="#R19">19</a>, <a href="#R20">20</a>
               ]
               is helpful for enhancing the validity of, and accountability in, sustainability science.
               Reflexive approaches which call for a greater recognition of both of our personal
               norms and values and those at work in processes where knowledge is generated and assessed
               could offer an avenue for a broader acknowledgement of indigenous perspectives and
               ways of being.

            <p id="d1e206">The paper is organized in the following manner: the next section examines the role
               of IK in sustainability science and the range of issues that arise in conducting indigenous-related
               research. The third section presents the case study of indigenous sustainability research
               from Aotearoa New Zealand where a new innovative knowledge integration methodology
               is used to provide a more inclusive and holistic approach to the notion of sustainability.
               This example is used to demonstrate the underlying different worldviews that IK holders
               and scientists often have and to highlight the necessity of considering the differences
               and similarities of different types of knowledges in knowledge production processes.
               This, we argue, does not mean only considering IK but finding innovative ways to understand
               and consider the multiplicity of meanings that exist in each context and influence
               what `sustainability' can and should look like. The last section summarizes the main
               points of the paper and also provides some suggestions how to move forward in this
               area of research.

               many of the proposed research themes can certainly be applied to indigenous sustainability
               research, the agenda treats `society', to some extent, as a somewhat uniform collective,
               with agreed processes of knowledge production. Yet, recently some sustainability scientists
               are starting to recognize IK as an integral part of sustainability science and draw

            <p id="d1e275">InAotearoa New Zealand, freshwater systems are affected by persistent degradation
               due to human activities. Some of the most immediate problems include nutrient contamination,
               heavy metals, flooding, biodiversity loss, invasive species, and over extraction.
               These problems present ongoing threats to the health and well-being of both ecological
               and human communities. Researchers at the University of Auckland are undertaking a
               transdisciplinary research project that investigates attempts to accommodate mātauranga
               Māori (Māori IK) and scientific knowledge in river co- governance and co-management.
               The three-year project (2016–2018) investigates the ways in which Ngāti Maniapoto
               (a Māori iwi or tribe in the central North Island) are asserting mātauranga and kaitiakitanga
               (Māori stewardship according to iwi aspirations and practices) in relation to the
               co-governance and co-management of the Waipā River.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e277">The Waipā River is the major tributary of the Waikato River, New Zealand's longest
               river, and has been identified as one of the most degraded freshwater systems in Aotearoa
               New Zealand

               . The Waipā River and its tributaries flow through environments that have been radically
               changed by human activities over the last 180 years. The consequences of radical environmental
               changes within the river catchment now present challenges for local communities and
               institutions (including local iwi). Co-governance and co-management of the Waipā River
               are formalized through legislation passed in 2012 (Nga wai o Maniapoto (Waipā River)
               Act 2012) following the settlement of a Treaty of Waitangi claim. The Treaty settlement
               was enabled by right to redress for grievances under the Treaty of Waitangi, which
               was signed by representatives of the British Crown and Māori Chiefs on 6 February
               1840. The starting point for the Maniapoto co-governance and co-management arrangements
               was the settlement between the Crown and Waikato-Tainui in 2008 in respect of the
               Waikato River. The current research examines the histories of the Waipā River and
               the close links between Māori dispossession and environmental change from the 1860s
               to the 1900s; contemporary governance arrangements and institutional changes that
               emphasize collaboration between Ngāti Maniapoto and the Crown; and, the ways in which
               expectations about uses of rivers and aspirations for river futures are evolving and
               being translated into restoration actions.

               own iwi) and professional relationship (participating in various projects and taking
               roles on various iwi environmental boards) the enactive and performative nature of

               and customs with regard to engagement, interaction, and knowledge sharing and conducting

            <p id="d1e323">The research findings to date indicate that progress in freshwater restoration and
               management of the Waipā River, as with other rivers in Aotearoa New Zealand, depends
               on building a better understanding of the multiple ways through which the biophysical,
               socio-cultural and economic dimensions of freshwater have been experienced, understood
               and narrated over time. For Waikato Regional Council (WRC), the regional government
               body responsible for the planning and management of the Waipā River, river management
               and, thus, water quality concerns focus on sedimentation, nutrient levels as a consequence
               of agricultural intensification, and microbial contamination (Waikato Regional Council
               2014). In response, the WRC developed the Waipā Catchment Plan in collaboration with
               the Waipā Zone Liaison Subcommittee, Maniaipoto Māori Trust Board and representatives
               of other <i>iwi</i> groups with an interest in the Waikato River (Waikato- Tainui Te Kauhanganui Incorporated,
               Raukawa Charitable Trust, Ngāti Mahanga and Ngāti Koroki Kahukura). The Catchment
               Plan adopts a catchment approach and the WRC seeks to address water quality problems
               through the use of models to identify highly erodible land, pressure points and sediment
               yields. In addition, monitoring stations are located along the Waipā and its tributary
               to measure changes in water quality. While this conventional scientific approach to
               estimating sediment losses and levels of nitrogen and phosphorous in waterways is
               useful for addressing the physical dimensions and characteristics of H2O 
               [
               <a href="#R43">43</a>
               ]
               , the social, cultural, spiritual and metaphysical characteristics of the <i>awa</i> (river) are absent from such calculative practices.
               
            </p>
            <p id="d1e334">For Ngāti Maniapoto the Waipā River is identified as being at the heart of Maniapoto
               spiritual and physical well-being and tribal identity and culture. The Waipā is considered
               a <i>taonga</i> (treasure) and the <i>mauri</i> (life force) of the <i>iwi</i>.  As such, decisions on how to manage the Waipā necessarily include attending to
               Waiwaia, a taniwha and kaitiaki (guardian) of the Waipā River and the Ngāti Maniapoto
               people. <i>Taniwha</i> are supernatural creatures that inhabit rivers, lakes, or caves, and may be seen
               as symbols of the mythical and metaphorical embodiment of the relations between Māori
               and their rivers. To Maniapoto, Waiwaia is held to be the essence and well-being of
               the Waipā. This relationship is explicitly acknowledged in Nga wai o Maniapoto (Waipā
               River) Act 2012. Following the passing of this legislation, Ngāti Maniapoto have engaged
               in a number of projects that focus on managing and restoring the Waipā. The <i>Maniapoto Upper Waipā Fisheries Plan 2015</i> provides for the protection, restoration and enhancement of the fisheries resources
               of the Waipā River catchment (Watene-Rawiri, Kukutai and Maniapoto Māori Trust Board,
               2015). In developing the <i>Fisheries Plan</i>, the Fisheries Reference Group adopted a <i>mātauranga</i> framework to convey the ontological and epistemological commitment by the group to
               acknowledging the multiple dimensions constituting the Waipā River (Kukutai, Watene-Rawiri
               and Maniapoto Māori Trust Board, 2015. Not only is Waiwaia explicitly identified and
               acknowledged within the <i>Fisheries Plan</i>; he was ever present at the meetings undertaken to develop the <i>Fisheries Plan</i> through recollections and stories shared by members of the <i>iwi</i> (Watene-Rawiri, Kukutai and Maniapoto Māori Trust Board, 2015). Ensuring the continuation
               of the reciprocal relationship between Waiwaia and Ngāti Maniapoto is at the forefront
               of the <i>Fisheries Plan</i>.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e370">These plans speak to the challenges of reconciling different knowledge traditions
               and ways of knowing rivers that characterize western science and Indigenous knowledge.
               In acknowledging that transforming freshwater management requires a broader appreciation
               of the diversity of communities, knowledges, and future planning needs, there is currently
               no consensus about how best to accommodate these different dimensions or how they
               can be used to build a freshwater management system able to halt environmental decline
               and enhance river health for future generations. For WRC, while the <i>Waipā Catchment Plan</i> acknowledges the special relationship between Ngāti Maniapoto, Waiwaia and the Waipā,
               an explicit <i>mātauranga</i> approach is absent.
               Rather than a lack of care or disregard for Waiwaia and <i>mātauranga</i> Māori, the care and protection
               of a supernatural creature and the spiritual dimensions of the river are not the traditional
               purview of a management organization utilizing western science. The <i>Maniapoto Upper Waipā Fisheries Plan 2015</i> can be seen as an attempt to incorporate scientific information into a <i>mātauranga</i> framework. While there is potential for this plan to precipitate changes in how fisheries
               (and river) management is imagined and practiced, the possibility also exists that
               a dual system is perpetuated in which Ngāti Maniapoto concerns are essentialized as
               simply `cultural' and Western science retains its privileged position in determining
               river futures. New, innovative, transdisciplinary approaches that move beyond the
               reliance on conventional scientific knowledge as the sole basis for thinking about
               freshwater management and restoration are needed (Figure <a href="#Fig02">2</a>).
            </p>
            <p id="d1e391">The overall goal of the “Rethinking Freshwater” project is to co-produce knowledge
               about freshwater with Māori, particularly Ngāti Maniapoto, and stakeholders in the
               Waipā River catchment. Stakeholders include local and regional governments, scientists,
               individual farmers, recreational users of the Waipā River, as well as a range of private
               sector and industry organisations. Understanding how IK can be accommodated in river
               restoration to enable the expression of cultural and spiritual values provides an
               opportunity to enhance ecological restoration scholarship and practice and to rethink
               how water resource management practices are done. By considering different knowledges
               and values (social, cultural and spiritual, in addition to economic and ecological)
               that are attached to the Waipā River, this project seeks to shift conceptual thinking
               away from narrowly delineated scientific measures of river value to a more inclusive
               approach.

            <p id="d1e405">In this paper we have discussed the role of IK in sustainability science and the challenges
               associated with the inclusion and consideration of IK in scientific discourse in general.
               We discussed the rationale for considering scientific knowledge and IK as mutually
               inclusive and useful sources of knowledge in reaching a fuller understanding of sustainability.
               Our Waipā River case study demonstrates attempts by conventional resource managers
               and indigenous peoples to utilize different knowledges to inform river management
               practices. In both cases, we found that the existence of different interpretations
               of river degradation and identifying possible solutions in a more holistic manner
               was recognized; however, the extent to which these different knowledges were translated
               into management plans (and practices) varied.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e407">We argue that there is a need to recognize the influence that environmental determinism
               and colonialism have in shaping the sustainability research agenda as is the need
               to pay closer attention
               to how research is designed, to what ends, and how communities are framed in research.
               All too often who is included in ‘society’ and the assessment of desired outcomes
               is exclusive of indigenous groups and represents mainstream ideologies that have become
               manifested overtime through visions which in turn have guided modifications of landscapes

               ]
               . We suggest that scholars need to adopt innovative methodologies that take into account
               both the historical legacies and present day concerns of indigenous communities about
               research, which includes confronting the “lingering imperialism…embedded in self-proclaimed
               critical methodologies” 
               [
               <a href="#R26">26</a>
               ]
               . In our research, we examined the historical records on governance decisions on New
               Zealand’s landscape modifications

               <a href="#R44">44</a>
               ]
               . For the Waipā, we are constructing narratives of river knowledges and practices
               through historical analyses, interviews with diverse stakeholders, workshops run according
               to Māori tradition and cultural practices, and other ethnographic techniques that
               facilitate the sharing of stories to gain deeper insights into the diverse ideologies
               and sources of knowledge embedded across time and space.

                        and cultural practices are essential avenues for knowledge transmission. Hence, approaches
                        that view knowledge systems as contextually-based and located in specific places and
                        times is necessary while also recognizing the broader insights that place-specific

                        This approach views people as collaborators and partners in co- design of research
                        and production of knowledge, rather than merely as informants.

                        researchers rarely consider sharing their research. Sharing knowledge needs to be
                        an ongoing and two-way process. Giving indigenous communities access to all copies
                        of research documents and engaging them in the analysis process will ensure that the
                        results are participatory and representative.

            <p id="d1e445">We encourage approaches that are explicit about the kind of knowledge each stakeholder
               group holds as most `valid' to guide the development of solutions to achieving sustainability.
               In our opinion, such an approach enables a deeper understanding of the diversity of
               perceptions needed for more holistic approaches to sustainability. This is, however,
               not always straight forward particularly when ideas embedded in IK and/or policy discourse
               conflict with researchers' own ideas and values. IK is not a homogeneous body of knowledge
               and claims of the need to promote a particular traditional practice and way of being
               can be contested within a cultural group. To respect the diversity found within IK,
               we as researchers must work with different segments of the communities (e.g. women,
               younger people, people with disabilities), to ensure appropriate protocols concerning
               the sharing and representation of IK are accepted across the group.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e447">In such cases a normative and ethical challenge emerges that requires unpacking how
               researchers and the groups we work with conceptualize `sustainability', what expectations
               we share and do not share in terms of how sustainability could be achieved, and what
               goals and values are ultimately driving these aspirations. While this necessitates
               the integration of different knowledge systems 
               [
               <a href="#R45">45</a>
               ]
               and finding ways to accommodate spiritual, material and technical views embedded in
               natural resource management, it also calls for closer introspection of our own biases,
               values, and preferences. Creating such diverse yet shared visions of sustainability
               
               [
               <a href="#R46">46</a>
               ]
               can lead to richer and more inclusive ways to tackle solutions.
