                              effective, equitable and meaningful strategies to address socio-ecological crises.
                              However efforts to integrate IK and Western science frequently encounter difficulties
                              due to different systems of knowledge production and underlying worldviews. New approaches
                              are needed so that sustainability can progress on the terms that matter the most for
                              the people involved. In this paper we discuss a case study from Aotearoa New Zealand
                              where an indigenous community is in the process of renegotiating and enacting new
                              indigenous-led approaches to address coupled socio-ecological crises. We reflect on
                              novel methodological approaches that highlight the ways in which projects/knowledge
                              are co-produced by a multiplicity of human and non-human actors. To this end we draw
                              on conceptualizations of environmental ethics offered by indigenous scholars and propose
                              alternative bodies of thought, methods, and practices that can support the wider sustainability
                              agenda.

                                 of Indigenous Knowledge (IK) in the development and implementation of policies and
                                 management approaches

                                 . The recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report
                                 signals this importance of IK as a building block of human security in stating that
                                 there is a high likelihood and robust evidence to demonstrate that “indigenous, local
                                 and traditional forms of knowledge are a major resource for adapting to climate change”
                                 (

                                 hoped to promote more robust approaches in increasing community resilience, adaptation,
                                 sustainability, and disaster preparedness

                                 systems can “lead to a more effective interface between science, policy and society”
                                 (

                                 the potential to examine the world through a more holistic approach, something that
                                 is often associated with indigenous groups' way of viewing the world. In this paper,
                                 our main aim is to discuss the range of challenges regarding integration, the ways
                                 IK is currently understood and researched, and the need for recognition of historical
                                 ideologies and processes, particularly in relation to matters of equity, accountability
                                 and fairness in indigenous- related research.

                                 more attuned to indigenous groups' priorities and aspirations

                                 due to the problematic treatment of IK by scholars. The dominant framing of IK is
                                 as a complementary source of knowledge to (Western) science, which can be used to
                                 augment empirical data on local environmental conditions including the status of biodiversity

                                 and universal and IK as highly situated, specific, embedded, and subjective. Thus
                                 scholars criticize Indigenous Knowledge-holders for having “inaccurate and poor conception…of
                                 past ecosystems and the changes undergone in their surrounding environment” (

                                 on IK traditions. There is also little appreciation or questioning of the knowledge
                                 base/roots where Western science and colonialism originated from, with their conceptual
                                 roots in European local histories that have became globally applied

                                 of IK in sustainability science and the range of issues that arise in conducting indigenous-related
                                 research. The third section presents the case study of indigenous sustainability research
                                 from Aotearoa New Zealand where a new innovative knowledge integration methodology
                                 is used to provide a more inclusive and holistic approach to the notion of sustainability.
                                 This example is used to demonstrate the underlying different worldviews that IK holders
                                 and scientists often have and to highlight the necessity of considering the differences
                                 and similarities of different types of knowledges in knowledge production processes.
                                 This, we argue, does not mean only considering IK but finding innovative ways to understand
                                 and consider the multiplicity of meanings that exist in each context and influence

                                 due to human activities. Some of the most immediate problems include nutrient contamination,
                                 heavy metals, flooding, biodiversity loss, invasive species, and over extraction.
                                 These problems present ongoing threats to the health and well-being of both ecological
                                 and human communities. Researchers at the University of Auckland are undertaking a
                                 transdisciplinary research project that investigates attempts to accommodate mātauranga
                                 Māori (Māori IK) and scientific knowledge in river co- governance and co-management.
                                 The three-year project (2016–2018) investigates the ways in which Ngāti Maniapoto
                                 (a Māori iwi or tribe in the central North Island) are asserting mātauranga and kaitiakitanga
                                 (Māori stewardship according to iwi aspirations and practices) in relation to the

                                 changed by human activities over the last 180 years. The consequences of radical environmental
                                 changes within the river catchment now present challenges for local communities and
                                 institutions (including local iwi). Co-governance and co-management of the Waipā River
                                 are formalized through legislation passed in 2012 (Nga wai o Maniapoto (Waipā River)
                                 Act 2012) following the settlement of a Treaty of Waitangi claim. The Treaty settlement
                                 was enabled by right to redress for grievances under the Treaty of Waitangi, which
                                 was signed by representatives of the British Crown and Māori Chiefs on 6 February
                                 1840. The starting point for the Maniapoto co-governance and co-management arrangements
                                 was the settlement between the Crown and Waikato-Tainui in 2008 in respect of the
                                 Waikato River. The current research examines the histories of the Waipā River and
                                 the close links between Māori dispossession and environmental change from the 1860s

                                 a <i>taonga</i> (treasure) and the <i>mauri</i> (life force) of the <i>iwi</i>.  As such, decisions on how to manage the Waipā necessarily include attending to

                                 an explicit <i>mātauranga</i> approach is absent.
                                 Rather than a lack of care or disregard for Waiwaia and <i>mātauranga</i> Māori, the care and protection

The <i>Maniapoto Upper Waipā Fisheries Plan 2015</i> can be seen as an attempt to incorporate scientific information into a <i>mātauranga</i> framework. While there is potential for this plan to precipitate changes in how fisheries
                                 (and river) management is imagined and practiced, the possibility also exists that

                                 river futures. New, innovative, transdisciplinary approaches that move beyond the
                                 reliance on conventional scientific knowledge as the sole basis for thinking about

                              <p id="d1e405">In this paper we have discussed the role of IK in sustainability science and the challenges
                                 associated with the inclusion and consideration of IK in scientific discourse in general.
                                 We discussed the rationale for considering scientific knowledge and IK as mutually
                                 inclusive and useful sources of knowledge in reaching a fuller understanding of sustainability.
                                 Our Waipā River case study demonstrates attempts by conventional resource managers
                                 and indigenous peoples to utilize different knowledges to inform river management
                                 practices. In both cases, we found that the existence of different interpretations
                                 of river degradation and identifying possible solutions in a more holistic manner
                                 was recognized; however, the extent to which these different knowledges were translated
                                 into management plans (and practices) varied.

                                 group holds as most `valid' to guide the development of solutions to achieving sustainability.
                                 In our opinion, such an approach enables a deeper understanding of the diversity of
                                 perceptions needed for more holistic approaches to sustainability. This is, however,
                                 not always straight forward particularly when ideas embedded in IK and/or policy discourse
                                 conflict with researchers' own ideas and values. IK is not a homogeneous body of knowledge
                                 and claims of the need to promote a particular traditional practice and way of being
                                 can be contested within a cultural group. To respect the diversity found within IK,
                                 we as researchers must work with different segments of the communities (e.g. women,
                                 younger people, people with disabilities), to ensure appropriate protocols concerning
                                 the sharing and representation of IK are accepted across the group.
