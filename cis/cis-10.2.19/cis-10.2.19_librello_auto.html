                                 grounded normative claims about what courses of action society should pursue in order
                                 to achieve sustainability. From a survey of the philosophy of science, social theory
                                 and sustainability science literature, I put forward an approach to justifying these
                                 normative arguments. This approach builds on the insight that social theories are
                                 value-laden and that dominant and pervasive social practices find their justification
                                 in some social theory. The approach: (i) focuses on the analysis of concrete cases;
                                 (ii) paying attention to the social practices that produce environmental problems
                                 and the theories that support those practices; (iii) examines alternative theories,
                                 and (iv) justifies a normative position by identifying the most comprehensive theoretical
                                 understanding of the particular case. Although the approach focuses on the analysis
                                 of particular cases it does not rely on value relativism. Furthermore, while the focus
                                 is on the role of science in producing normative arguments about societyâ€™s trajectory,
                                 it maintains space for the inclusion of the values of the public in environmental
                                 decision-making. However, while this approach aims to provide a rational basis to
                                 normative positions, it does not presume that this will lead to social consensus on
                                 these issues. &nbsp;</span></div>

                              <p id="d1e73">Sustainability science is an interdisciplinary field of study, which focuses on environmental
                                 problems and their social context, with the ambition to be use-inspired [<a href="#R1">1</a>]. Normativity is therefore considered an important feature of sustainability science
                                 [<a href="#R2">2</a>], meaning that it must deal with the evaluation of states of affairs (i.e. which
                                 are more and less sustainable) rather than just their description. Sustainability
                                 science deals with the interaction of society and nature [<a href="#R1">1</a>, <a href="#R3">3</a>], this raises the question of how sustainability science should handle social values,
                                 and what these values should be. Though the field itself has been around for more
                                 than 20 years, this continues to be a subject of discussion [<a href="#R3">3</a>]. In a recent intervention, for example, Nagatsu et al. [<a href="#R4">4</a>] have argued that it is crucial for the success of sustainability science to justify
                                 how values may legitimately enter into science. The central aim of this paper is to
                                 put forward one approach to providing such justification.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e94">Although there has been much recent discussion of the role of social values and normativity
                                 within sustainability science [<a href="#R5">5</a>, <a href="#R6">6</a>, <a href="#R7">7</a>], much of this discussion has tended to be disconnected from fields that have a long
                                 tradition of discussing the role of social values in science [<a href="#R6">6</a>]. Though normativity has always been central to sustainability science, it has thus
                                 far failed to draw on the full wealth of approaches from social sciences and the humanities
                                 that deal explicitly with it [<a href="#R8">8</a>]. Ignoring the discussion of these issues in other fields risks recreating old mistakes
                                 and doing poor scientific work [<a href="#R7">7</a>]. I engage with arguments from philosophy, in both the analytic and continental traditions,
                                 and social theory to develop the approach in this article. I also position the approach
                                 in relation to sustainability science literature by referring to some recent and key
                                 literature.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e115">I construct the approach in this paper by engaging with three related debates, which
                                 give this paper its structure. Along the way, I compare and contrast this approach
                                 with various approaches in sustainability science, and close with a summary of what
                                 I see as its advantages over others. The approach I propose in this paper holds that
                                 sustainability science can make objectively grounded normative claims about what courses
                                 of action society should pursue. However, it does not claim this as the exclusive
                                 remit of science; rather it allows space for the inclusion of the values of the public
                                 in decision-making. At the same time, it does this without reducing the problem to
                                 one of â€˜participationâ€™ or â€˜stakeholder dialogueâ€™. Nor does the approach seek to provide
                                 a universal list of values or general ethical frameworks, but justifies support for
                                 particular courses of action by analysing the application of theory in particular
                                 cases, and though it is sensitive to context, it avoids value relativism. With that
                                 said, it should be noted from the outset that the claim to provide objective support
                                 to normative positions is not a claim that social consensus on these issues will follow.
                                 In society, normative positions will inevitably be coloured by interests, ideologies,
                                 and so on, which even the highest levels of scientific consensus can never overcome.
                                 A case in point being the scientific consensus around anthropogenic climate change.
                                 What this argument can provide is (social) scientific justification for the pursuit
                                 of particular courses of action, which plays an important but limited part in the
                                 struggle between interests and ideologies.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e117">I will use the term objectivity in this paper a number of times. This is a very controversial
                                 term in the philosophy of science [<a href="#R9">9</a>]. Given the social necessity for science to be trustworthy, it is fitting that science
                                 should question the primary notion of what makes it trustworthy, namely objectivity.
                                 Yet, for the same reason, it is surprising that objectivity is so often and so easily
                                 written-off. For reasons that will become more obvious, I do not subscribe to notions
                                 of objectivity that equate it with being value-free. I use a capacious understanding
                                 of objectivity as non-subjectivity, meaning that objective knowledge is communicable
                                 between subjects. I follow the spirit of Popperâ€™s statement that â€˜â€˜the objectivity
                                 of scientific statements lies in the fact that they can be inter-subjectively testedâ€™â€™
                                 ([<a href="#R10">10</a>], p.&nbsp;22). I also acknowledge the importance of the social dimension of science in
                                 dealing with the fact that it is value-laden, to which Longino brings focus [<a href="#R11">11</a>], but ultimately argue that competing theoretical explanations can be objectively
                                 compared, following Lakatos [<a href="#R12">12</a>]. In relation to social values in sustainability, this definition implies that rational
                                 normative arguments can be constructed and subjected to intersubjective critique.
                                 Successful critique will show that one normative claim is objectively superior to
                                 another.

                                       within the analytic tradition of philosophy. Here the representatives of the different
                                       lines of critique are Heather Douglas [<a href="#R13">13</a>] and Hilary Putnam [<a href="#R14">14</a>]. Both hold that science cannot be value-free, but in different ways. Douglas focuses
                                       on the licit and illicit roles social values play in decision-making during the scientific
                                       process and the role of science in public decision-making, Putnam focuses on how scientific
                                       <i>theories</i> entail particular value positions. These arguments imply that we must provide justification
                                       for the values that enter into scientific practice in two ways: (i) we must justify
                                       how values enter into scientifically informed decision-making, and (ii) we must justify
                                       the values that obtain in the theories we apply in scientific research. I build the
                                       approach in this paper in response to the second point. I then treat the first point
                                       as a particular case of the second, and attempt a schematic application of the approach
                                       developed in this article to the question of values in decision-making.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e145">The second point, the question of justifying the values embedded in social theories,
                                       entails the question of whether values can be objective. This discussion centres on
                                       whether it is possible to decide that some values, and thereby some value-laden theories,
                                       and therefore some courses of action as described by theory, are objectively better
                                       than others. After briefly discussing positions that deny any objectivity to values,
                                       I show how many classical and contemporary social theorists support it. There are
                                       two approaches to this justification, one coming from Kant and the other from Hegel,
                                       broadly speaking. In summary, whereas the Kantian approach removes discussions over
                                       the justification of values to an abstract realm of reasoning parallel to science,
                                       the Hegelian approach argues that the justification of values cannot be separated
                                       from the practice of science in concrete contexts. I present a brief argument for
                                       why I favour the Hegelian approach and I close the section by quickly outlining the
                                       general tenets of the approach that is the main contribution of this paper.

                                    <p id="d1e147">In the third section, I return to the issue of scientifically informed decision-making
                                       to present a schematic application of the approach. After outlining a common approach
                                       to integrating values in decision-making from within sustainability science, and what
                                       have been identified as problems with this approach, I give an account of how three
                                       different approaches in social theory propose solutions to this problem. Each of these
                                       theoretical approaches entail normative claims about how social values should be incorporated
                                       in decision-making, and at the same time entail normative claims about the state of
                                       affairs towards which society should move. In practice, justifying a particular course
                                       of action could draw on these theoretical approaches, but would require analysis of
                                       concrete environmental problems and associated decision-making processes. I close
                                       the section by presenting how the approach might be put into practice more broadly
                                       in sustainability science, and conclude the paper with a summary of how it compares
                                       to other approaches in the field.

                              <p id="d1e152">The value-free ideal of science proposes that science can and should be completely
                                 separated from social values [<a href="#R9">9</a>]. This in itself relies on a fact/value dichotomy where facts and values are seen
                                 as separable. According to Philip Gorski there are two sources of support for the
                                 value-free ideal in contemporary debates, the sociological methodology of Max Weber
                                 and the philosophical work of the logical positivists [<a href="#R15">15</a>, <a href="#R16">16</a>]. The critiques of the value-free ideal of science that follow below imply that values
                                 play a legitimate role in science. They thereby imply that the values that enter into
                                 science must be justified, and place some requirements on how they should be justified,
                                 which is the purpose of introducing them here.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e163">Gregor Betz [<a href="#R17">17</a>], a defender of the value-free ideal, argues that there are two distinct lines of
                                 attack on the value-free ideal. These he calls the semantic and the methodological
                                 critique. The semantic critique argues that the description of and the evaluation
                                 of objective states of affairs cannot be separated, and so it goes beyond attacking
                                 the value-free ideal and proposes a collapse of the clear distinction between facts
                                 and values. Weber anticipated this critique and thought, while it was difficult to
                                 separate facts from values and perhaps ultimately impossible, that this separation
                                 should be pursued to the greatest extent possible in the practice of science [<a href="#R18">18</a>]. One version of the semantic critique is put forward by Hillary Putnam [<a href="#R14">14</a>] who argues that the separation between evaluation and description is not possible
                                 even in a limited sense. I will return to this later. The methodological critique,
                                 which I will deal with first, Weber does not anticipate. It argues that social values
                                 play a necessary and desirable role in the scientific process, from a methodological
                                 point of view. This position is, according to Betz, most forcefully argued by Heather
                                 Douglas [<a href="#R13">13</a>].

                                    <p id="d1e180">Douglas distinguishes between two potential roles for social values in the practice
                                       of science, a direct and an indirect role:
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e182">
                                       <i>â€˜â€˜In the first direct role, the values act much the same way as evidence normally
                                          does, providing warrant or reasons to accept a claim. In the second, indirect role,
                                          the values do not compete with or supplant evidence, but rather determine the importance
                                          of the inductive gaps left by the evidenceâ€™â€™</i> ([<a href="#R13">13</a>], p.&nbsp;96).
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e190">She argues that values should only play a direct role at very limited times, in particular
                                       in the selection of problems for investigation. On this point she agrees with Weber.
                                       But whereas for Weber values should be excluded wholesale from that point onward,
                                       and science should instrumentally pursue the solution of the problem, Douglas argues
                                       that values can also play an indirect, methodological role. She elaborates the indirect
                                       role through discussion of the concept of inductive risk. Inductive risk is the risk
                                       entailed when choosing to accept or reject a hypothesis based on findings with a certain
                                       level of uncertainty. Douglas proposes that certain hypotheses entail greater social
                                       risks and that this should be considered when deciding to reject or accept a hypothesis
                                       under conditions of uncertainty. For example, if mistakenly accepting a hypothesis
                                       might cause death, then perhaps the standard for acceptable uncertainty should be
                                       higher than if the social risks are lower, for example, if there is a risk that a
                                       food product will not be as sweet as desired. These social risks are determined by
                                       what is valued socially, e.g. human life is more valuable to us than sweetness. In
                                       this sense, Douglas argues that social values should enter into the practice of science
                                       in a methodological role. Betz [<a href="#R17">17</a>], responding to Douglas, defends the value-free ideal, essentially with a return
                                       to Weber, by asserting that uncertainties can be clearly communicated to the relevant
                                       decision-makers, there is no need for scientists to establish levels of acceptable
                                       uncertainty, this is the duty of politicians in a democratically organized society.

                                    <p id="d1e195">But these positions, though they might stand on opposite sides the philosophical debate
                                       over inductive risk, agree on a particular point that is instructive for the purposes
                                       of this paper. For both authors, certain social values have a role in determining
                                       the use of science, without affecting its objectivity. Douglas sees this as within
                                       the scientific process and Betz sees it as outside it, but for both, these values
                                       come from society, either at large or through formal political institutions. Both
                                       Douglas and Betz accept social values as decisive in determining the use of science,
                                       but the question of why we should accept these values (either as scientists or politicians)
                                       is, for both, separate from the practice of science. Nevertheless, by placing their
                                       hope in vague democratic processes, these arguments allude to the idea that values
                                       that enter into scientifically informed decision-making must be justified. In section
                                       , I will show how the approach I develop in the rest of the paper would approach this
                                       particular problem.

                                    <p id="d1e200">[10]There is another line of argument against the value-free ideal, which highlights
                                       another role that values play in science and seems to be largely neglected by discussions
                                       over inductive risk. This is the second criticism of the value-free ideal: the so-called
                                       semantic critique. One version of this has been argued by Hillary Putnam [<a href="#R14">14</a>]. Putnam builds his argument from engagement with the logical positivists, who argue
                                       that normative and descriptive statements are of completely different kinds. Putnam
                                       builds on the work of Quine and Duhem [<a href="#R19">19</a>] who examined the role of background assumptions in the formulation of scientific
                                       hypotheses, showing that what becomes accepted as knowledge can enter into science
                                       through experience and convention rather than the strict procedures of science. Putnam
                                       argues that it is not only convention and experience that are presupposed in science
                                       but values too. He focuses both on epistemic and ethical values. To make this argument
                                       Putnam draws our attention to what he calls â€˜â€˜thick conceptsâ€™â€™, concepts which combine
                                       descriptive and evaluative elements in an inextricable way, for example, â€˜crueltyâ€™,
                                       â€˜courageâ€™, and so on. The implication is that the presence of thick concepts in scientific
                                       theories means that they cannot be expunged of values.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e208">Putnam uses welfare economics as an example of how social theories necessarily entail
                                       value-laden concepts. Putnam discusses the attempt to establish economics on a value-free
                                       basis by the likes of Lionel Robbins [<a href="#R14">14</a>], partially under the influence of the logical positivists. The supposedly value-free
                                       basis of economics relied on the argument that utility can act as an objective measure
                                       of innumerable subjective mental states. Robbins argued that the comparison of individual
                                       utilities is meaningless, which means redistribution according to marginal utility
                                       is invalid, and Pareto Optimality becomes the supposedly value neutral aim of economics.
                                       But, Putnam argues, that the assumption that interpersonal comparisons of utility
                                       are meaningless, that one person cannot be said to get more utility from $1000 than
                                       another (even if the exact proportion of the differences in utility is not quantifiable),
                                       is in itself evaluative, and actually quite absurd. Concepts like utility and Pareto
                                       optimality, which abound in economics, are in fact thick concepts. The case has also
                                       been made for the concept of rational actors, which functions similarly in economic
                                       theory [<a href="#R16">16</a>]. The upshot of this argument is that economic theory is saturated in evaluative
                                       statements and is therefore inherently value-laden.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e216">This argument can be extended to social science theories generally. To take an over-simplified
                                       example for the point of illustration: values applied in Douglasâ€™ direct role in social
                                       science might dictate that we want to deal with a problem like poverty. Social scientists
                                       will be enlisted to find the way of solving the problem. But this will require the
                                       selection of economic theory. Different theories will suggest that to reduce poverty
                                       means different things. Do we reduce absolute or relative poverty, for example? Do
                                       we aim for growth in GDP or in other indicators like health and education? Value judgements
                                       like these are inherent to particular theories. The selection of a problem to deal
                                       with, means selecting a construction of that problem within a theory, which brings
                                       with it certain value judgements.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e218">This is a deeper implication of values in science than Douglas conceptualizes, which
                                       raises the question of whether this incursion of values affects the objectivity of
                                       the scientific work and whether we can justify the inclusion of the values entailed
                                       in theories, or is it a matter of personal choice or political bent. According to
                                       Putnam, value-laden concepts and theories are still subject to rational critique and
                                       therefore the concept of objectivity still applies [<a href="#R9">9</a>]. We can, for example, argue that it is more rational to pursue improvements in health
                                       and education rather than growth in GDP, or vice versa. Or as I will discuss later,
                                       we can argue that it is more rational to pursue transformation of agricultural systems
                                       in a particular country than pursuing incremental agricultural intensification. We
                                       will see in the next section that there are, broadly speaking, two different possible
                                       approaches to justification. Both of these positions hold that values themselves are
                                       subject to inter-subjective critique, meaning not whether they exist or not, but whether
                                       some values are right and some are wrong. In our post-religious and post-truth world,
                                       this may at first glance appear as a kind of moralism, but this position is actually
                                       commonplace in the social sciences.

                              <p id="d1e226">[10]Recall my argument that both Betz and Douglas rely on a similar notion of democracy
                                 to decide which values should play a role in scientifically informed decision-making.
                                 This is a position echoed by others in the philosophy of science e.g. Intemann [<a href="#R20">20</a>], but it is also a prominent position in sustainability science. As has been pointed
                                 out by [<a href="#R21">21</a>], one of the founding works on sustainability science takes a similar position. The
                                 preface to â€˜â€˜Our Common Journeyâ€™â€™, by the National Research Council of the U.S., written
                                 by Bill Clark and Robert Kates, states that in relation to the setting of goals at
                                 which sustainability science should aim, â€˜â€˜(o)f course, which goals should be pursued
                                 is a normative question, not a scientific oneâ€™â€™ [<a href="#R22">22</a>]. The authors suggest that politicians should set goals, and science should set out
                                 to achieve these goals. This is a position more recently repeated by Noel Castree,
                                 who argues that, â€˜â€˜(e)nvironmental scientists are expected to supply answers to cognitive
                                 questions not normative onesâ€™â€™ and that â€˜â€˜scientific inquiry (should be) directly
                                 framed by political goals and policy optionsâ€™â€™ [<a href="#R23">23</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e240">There are others in sustainability science who take a similar position but rather
                                 than defer to democratic institutions they refer to localised deliberative practices
                                 within the research process to establish the orienting values. Such work often draws
                                 on the work of Funtowicz and Ravetz [<a href="#R24">24</a>], and Gibbonsâ€™s [<a href="#R25">25</a>] notion of Mode 2 science, who argue that traditional criteria of objectivity need
                                 to be augmented with social criteria in order to determine the usefulness and use
                                 of science. Lang et al [<a href="#R26">26</a>], for example, argue that common values can be achieved across political divides
                                 as part of transdisciplinary research processes to give science its normative orientation.
                                 However there is big difference between the level of social consensus alluded to by
                                 Funtowicz and Ravetz and the kind of localised dialogues proposed by Lang et al.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e251">Nevertheless, these positions end up with a similar problem: what says that the goals
                                 set in these supposedly democratic process are correct? Do not many contemporary politicians
                                 and policies conflict with our scientific understanding of what is necessary to deal
                                 with climate change, even down to outright denial? Or in the case of the latter group:
                                 assuming (and it is a very big assumption) common values can be achieved in these
                                 dialogues, what is to say that common values as established in localised discussions
                                 are necessarily the right values? Without getting into a protracted discussion over
                                 real versus perceived interests, or â€˜false consciousnessâ€™, do we not know from experience
                                 that high levels of social consensus can conflict with what science tells us about
                                 what is appropriate to address climate change? These approaches do not satisfactorily
                                 solve the problem of justifying the values that enter into science.

                                    <p id="d1e256">There are of course, those who reject the possibility of establishing the â€˜rightâ€™
                                       values at all. The above positions follow Weber to the extent that they defer to political
                                       goals to guide science. However, Weber, like other value relativists, denies that
                                       there is any possibility of establishing these values as objectively right. Following
                                       Nietzscheâ€™s perspectivism [<a href="#R27">27</a>], Weberâ€™s position is that values are plural in modern society and cannot be reconciled
                                       or unified, they are â€˜warring godsâ€™ [<a href="#R18">18</a>]. This position is popular in both modern liberal thought, as exemplified in the
                                       politics of Weber himself, but also in post-modern theory following the likes of Foucault
                                       and Derrida. A recent review of the values question in sustainability science seems
                                       to end up in a similar position, though without tracing the lineage of these ideas
                                       [<a href="#R6">6</a>]. The authors of this review argue that there are numerous different ways for researchers
                                       to approach values, and that the individual researcher should reflect on their own
                                       value positions and declare them explicitly, but there is no suggestion of how we
                                       might determine whether some values are more conducive to sustainability than others.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e267">The Foucauldian response to this relativism is to side with the underdog, taking on
                                       the values of the marginalized, but with no rational justification beyond this [<a href="#R28">28</a>]. This position accepts that the struggles to address social or environmental problems
                                       are power struggles between different value positions; there are no objective foundations
                                       for taking particular normative positions on sustainability. However, if this is the
                                       case, then we have to ask, in a power struggle how likely are the underdogs or the
                                       marginal to win? And why make recourse to science at all? I think it should be clear
                                       that such an absolutely relativist position is untenable for sustainability science.

                                    <p id="d1e275">In the history of modern social thought value realism, the belief in the objectivity
                                       of social values, has been less problematic than it is in the post-truth environment
                                       of today [<a href="#R16">16</a>]. Gorksi uses the term ethical naturalism to describe a particular kind of value
                                       realism. This position holds that there are particular conditions under which humans
                                       will flourish and falter, and that these are objective features of the world. Because
                                       humans are social animals, social conditions will partly determine whether humans
                                       will flourish or not. Because of this, social theory has a role in saying under what
                                       conditions humans will flourish and not. Gorksi points out that this is a position
                                       taken by philosophers including Aristotle and Hegel, classical social theorists like
                                       Marx and Durkheim, and contemporary social thinkers like Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum.
                                       In terms of contemporary social science, sociology in the tradition of Marx or Durkheim
                                       and Senâ€™s economics all assume that social science can produce arguments that particular
                                       courses of social action are desirable. There is no space in this article to provide
                                       a full philosophical defence of this assumption.

                                    <p id="d1e280">What would adopting this position mean for sustainability? It would mean that sustainability
                                       science can have something to say about what we ought to do, because social theories
                                       are apt to describe conditions under which humans flourish (of which sustainability
                                       is surely a part). Science can have a role in saying where we should be aiming not
                                       just how we get there. But in order to do so the values that are entailed in these
                                       theories must be justified. There are two stereotypical options for this, the first
                                       can be traced back to Kant and the second to Hegelâ€™s critique of Kant.

                                             from the practice of science. For Kant morality â€˜â€˜belongs to a â€˜â€˜noumenalâ€™â€™ realm
                                             conceived as wholly separate from the empirical domain in which we live, decide, and
                                             actâ€™â€™ [<a href="#R29">29</a>], ethical reasoning is a form of universal reasoning conducted in parallel to the
                                             consideration of particular concrete circumstances and therefore separate from the
                                             examination of â€˜factsâ€™. This approach finds a contemporary representative in the Marxian
                                             sociologist Olin Wright [<a href="#R30">30</a>] who bases his critique of capitalist society in universal moral principles. From
                                             there he proposes particular courses of action to change society such that it would
                                             realize these principles. This also seems to be the position of Nagatsu et al. [<a href="#R4">4</a>] when they ask that â€˜â€˜ethical frameworksâ€™â€™ be developed for sustainability science
                                             to assist in scientifically informed decision-making. Indeed any approach that founds

                                          <p id="d1e302">To contrast with this approach is one where the justification of normative positions
                                             is done in tandem with the examination of society. This approach comes from Hegelâ€™s
                                             critique of Kant, where he stresses the contextual and historical nature of reason
                                             in contrast to Kantâ€™s universal reason [<a href="#R29">29</a>, <a href="#R32">32</a>]. Values can only be understood and evaluated in relation to the concrete social
                                             circumstances in which they operate. Their examination is therefore inseparable from
                                             the examination of â€˜factsâ€™. Similarly, which normative positions should be taken in
                                             particular circumstances will vary depending on the facts of that situation.

                                          <p id="d1e310">Marxâ€™s own work is a good example of this approach. Marxâ€™s view that capitalism must
                                             be transformed is not based on universal moral criteria but rather on capitalismâ€™s
                                             failure to deliver, or limited success in achieving, its promise of freedom and prosperity
                                             [<a href="#R33">33</a>, <a href="#R34">34</a>]. Only through a transition to socialism can the promise of capitalism be realised.
                                             This mode of reasoning is immanent (For more on immanent critique and normativity
                                             in sustainability science, see [<a href="#R21">21</a>, <a href="#R35">35</a>] and for applications in research, see [<a href="#R36">36</a>, <a href="#R37">37</a>]. The approach in this paper builds on this work by relating it to arguments in analytical
                                             philosophy, comparing its Hegelian foundations to the pervasive Kantian approach,
                                             and taking up the problem of values in decision-making, amongst other developments)
                                             [<a href="#R38">38</a>], which means that the necessity for change in a theory, mode of thought or system
                                             of social organisation, comes from the failures of the one examined. The new theory
                                             should explain everything that the previous one did, while also overcoming the problem
                                             that caused it to fail in the first place. This is a mode of scientific reasoning
                                             favoured also by Critical Realists [<a href="#R39">39</a>]. This approach assumes that prevailing and dominant social practices have some rational
                                             kernel, and therefore some theoretical support. Social systems, institutions and practices
                                             are justified by some social theory, which (as we learned from Putnam) entail values.
                                             These ideas and theories can be subjected to critique, examining whether they are
                                             consistent in themselves, whether they are applied consistently, and whether they
                                             conflict with empirical facts. If such failures are found, alternative or new improved
                                             theories can be developed and put into practice, which means setting new normative
                                             goals. The new normative orientation gets its objective justification from its improvement
                                             on the incumbent theory.

                                             or to give a full philosophical argument for supporting the Hegelian over the Kantian
                                             approach. However, even if the Kantian position is a philosophically valid way of
                                             supporting a normative position in a scientific argument, I think two points are sufficient
                                             to support the Hegelian over the Kantian position for the purposes of sustainability
                                             science. The first is that it maintains focus on the particular case being examined
                                             rather than deferring to abstract ethical systems to justify the proposed course of
                                             action. The second is that it seeks to point out the problems with the incumbent regime
                                             on the terms of that regime as opposed to from an external viewpoint. This, in principle,
                                             provides a critique that will be more convincing to supporters of the incumbent regime.

                                 analyse current cases of decision-making and the theoretical approach entailed. Though
                                 some form of Cost-Benefit Analysis tends to be dominant in environmental decision-making

                                 with many advocating for decision-making based on participation and deliberation,
                                 where the various values of the public can be integrated. Practitioners of this deliberative
                                 approach presume that in decision-making processes there are a range of different
                                 values (or norms, or political opinions etc.), but that these can be reconciled through
                                 discussion. For example, Raymond et al. [<a href="#R6">6</a>] argue that improved communication and better process design can resolve the problems
                                 of power imbalances and clashing values. A similar position is taken in some of the

                                 in the above quoted paragraph. Here is a clear weakness in the theory being applied,
                                 which has even been identified by those who advocate this approach.

                              <p id="d1e400">In order to apply the approach to developing objectively grounded normative arguments
                                 outlined in , let us suppose that an example of the deliberative approach to decision-making
                                 has failed because it replicated the â€˜business-as-usual approachâ€™ and failed to solve
                                 an environmental problem. Let us further suppose that analysis reveals that power
                                 dynamics within the deliberative environment were responsible for this failure. Whereas
                                 the deliberative approach has difficulty dealing with power dynamics, much social
                                 theory deals with this problem head on [<a href="#R44">44</a>, <a href="#R45">45</a>]. The procedure would be to survey the available theories that might improve on the
                                 understanding deployed by the deliberative approach, and apply them to the same case.
                                 There are various theories that may be useful here, three of which are reviewed in
                                 the following section. These theoretical approaches outline specific social conditions
                                 under which common values might be agreed upon and thereby guidance on how we might
                                 go about including the values of the public in decision-making processes.

                                    <p id="d1e411">The first example comes from economist Amartya Sen [<a href="#R46">46</a>, <a href="#R47">47</a>]. For Sen, there will inevitably be clashes of values in decision-making procedures,
                                       but this can be combatted by using a limited type of decision criteria. Sen argues
                                       against the dominant way of settling these disputes, which he identifies as aiming
                                       for the maximization of monetary value. He believes it is possible, under purposely-designed
                                       institutional arrangements, to come to a reasoned consensus on a prioritization of
                                       â€˜capabilitiesâ€™, or substantive freedoms, such as health, education, community ties,
                                       access to nature, and so on. These objectively measureable freedoms should be the
                                       focus of decision-making, he argues. This involves deliberation by those who will
                                       be affected by the decision, with the specific goal of developing a ranked list of
                                       capabilities with which to evaluate alternatives. Senâ€™s belief is that while we might
                                       not agree with another personâ€™s choice of priority, we have the ability to accept
                                       that another personâ€™s prioritization is reasonable [<a href="#R48">48</a>]. Aggregating the various priorities of a large group of people can thereby lead
                                       to an acceptable, if not ideal, outcome for those involved. This represents an advance
                                       on the simplistic ideas of deliberation and consensus, by focusing on objective capabilities
                                       and stringent institutional arrangements. However, Sen is optimistic that liberal
                                       democratic institutions and a market economy can work as the foundation for such decision-making
                                       procedures. This is a major point upon which Sen has received criticism. Peter Evans,
                                       for example, has argued that Sen underestimates the role of social structural forces
                                       in establishing values [<a href="#R49">49</a>]. In our hypothetical case, the possibility of implementing such an approach would
                                       have to be tested against the concrete case in question. Senâ€™s suggestion that the
                                       focus on capabilities might be able to overcome the problems in the deliberative approach
                                       may or may not be born out in the case. If it is not, the next two approaches may
                                       be more suitable.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e425">The second example comes from JÃ¼rgen Habermas [<a href="#R50">50</a>], who is superficially similar to Sen in the emphasis he places on speech and deliberation
                                       in establishing common values. However, whereas Sen sees the market economy as the
                                       foundation for unified values, Habermas argues that the perverse effects of the market
                                       must be resisted in order to establish unified values. Habermas thereby brings attention
                                       to the necessity of social change and institutional reform in order for democratic
                                       processes to be possible in the first place. Habermas deploys a theory of communicative
                                       reason, to argue that through discussion, but only under stringent conditions known
                                       as an â€˜ideal speech situationâ€™, the unforced force of the better argument will win
                                       out. This can allow the formation of common values, which can push back against the
                                       instrumentalisation of human life by the capitalist system, including presumably the
                                       instrumentalisation of nature and the environment. Habermas argues, however, that
                                       some form of social power will have to be deployed to achieve this, at different times
                                       placing his hope in social movements and the legal system.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e430">The final example here is taken from Gramsciâ€™s theory of hegemony [<a href="#R51">51</a>]. This position takes from Marx the idea that the dominant values in society are
                                       the values of the ruling class, or class-faction, in society. According to this theory,
                                       values are examined in terms of their social role, meaning their contribution to maintaining
                                       or challenging hegemony; how they function to unite or divide particular social groups,
                                       and so on. A gramscian analysis might explain the fact that the business-as-usual
                                       approach was replicated in our hypothetical decision-making process by reference to
                                       class interests and hegemonic politics. The struggle to make certain values (those
                                       that promote sustainability, for example) the basis of decisions, would therefore
                                       be understood within the context of hegemonic and counter-hegemonic politics. Ensuring
                                       democratic processes, which are capable of instilling â€˜sustainable valuesâ€™, would
                                       necessitate that social movements from subaltern groups in society make new values
                                       dominant through political action.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e435">With the latter two approaches, the problem, and therefore the normative argument,
                                       shifts from designing decision-making processes to processes of social change â€“ legal
                                       reforms, social movements â€“ which can ensure the possibility of democratic decision-making.
                                       It is worth pointing out here that drawing on these social-theoretical approaches
                                       comes with political implications. This contrasts with the depoliticized approach
                                       that seems to be favoured by some advocates of transdisciplinary deliberative approaches
                                       [<a href="#R52">52</a>].
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e440">The guiding notion of the approach outlined in  and outlined schematically here is
                                       that critique of the hypothetical case, drawing on one of these theories, or a range
                                       of other theoretical options, will result in a better analysis of the problem (meaning
                                       it solves the problem of why the deliberative process failed in the first place).
                                       The normative orientation that goes along with the new theoretical analysis will therefore
                                       be better justified.

                                    <p id="d1e445">I have focused on how this approach could be used in relation to concrete episodes
                                       of environmental decision-making and how they integrate values. But it could be applied
                                       to other value controversies in the field. Take for example the debate over whether
                                       we should transform agricultural production systems according to principles of agro-ecology
                                       or commit to a more gradual process of agricultural intensification, which Nagatsu
                                       et al. [<a href="#R4">4</a>] describe as a conflict over incompatible values. The approach outlined here would
                                       make this conflict an object of analysis in a concrete context. It could for example
                                       examine the extent to which intensification in a particular region is capable of achieving
                                       the sustainability goals it has outlined itself. If it is found to be lacking, it
                                       could investigate whether the agro-ecological approach seems better able to achieve
                                       these goals. Indeed such an analysis is not hypothetical, because work on very a similar
                                       question to this has been done by Ellinor Isgren [<a href="#R53">53</a>] in the Ugandan context, who found that agro-ecology was a better alternative. This
                                       analysis was broadly in line with the approach outlined here, though not explicitly
                                       so.

                              <p id="d1e456">[20]The discussion in this paper started by looking at the debate over inductive risk.
                                 This debate brings attention to the fact that an important point where values become
                                 entangled with science is in the process of decision-making. Which values enter into
                                 decision-making must be justified. In order to outline an approach to justifying the
                                 normative content of scientific arguments, I first drew on Putnamâ€™s argument that
                                 values penetrate science deeply, being inseparable from social scientific theories.
                                 The theories we use entail normative arguments about courses of action that society
                                 should take. Nevertheless, this normative content must be justified. I suggested this
                                 can be achieved in two ways either with reference to universal abstract moral principles
                                 or based on the analysis of particular concrete contexts, and favoured the latter
                                 as more useful in sustainability science. This allowed me to outline an approach to
                                 justifying normative positions taken in sustainability science based on the critique
                                 of the application of theory to concrete environmental problems. I returned to the
                                 question of how values enter into decision-making to show how this approach might
                                 be applied to these types of problems. It allowed me to introduce briefly some theory
                                 that could be useful for sustainability scientists both to suggest courses of action
                                 toward sustainability and that provide instruction on how values can enter into scientific
                                 decision-making.

                                          or fragments thereof, will reach a consensus on a course of action, and even though
                                          it pays attention to specific contexts it avoids value relativism. It does all of
                                          this by preserving a directly normative role for sustainability science in specifying
                                          courses of action to achieve sustainability.

                                          themselves outline conditions under which peopleâ€™s values should be involved in deciding
                                          on courses of action for sustainability.

                                 public about what they should do, but to engage with agents of change that are already
                                 directed toward the course of action that research identifies as desirable [<a href="#R35">35</a>, <a href="#R54">54</a>]. From there it is up to researchers to engage with agents in society to negotiate
                                 how their research can be practically useful in pursuing these courses of action.
                                 The implication of this is that we as sustainability scientists can have objective
                                 grounds for lending our support to particular agents of change.
