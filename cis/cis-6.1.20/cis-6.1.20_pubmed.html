                     reach that has been developed to encourage responsible and sustainable forest management.
                     Despite its broad appeal, there is little scientific assessment to substantiate the
                     effectiveness of FSC in the boreal zone. In this study, an ecosystem-based and participatory
                     approach was applied to a case study in the Arkhangelsk Region of the Russia Federation
                     to assess the potential influence of the principles, criteria and indicators of the
                     Russian FSC standard. An ECOSEFFECT theoretical plausibility analysis was conducted
                     to evaluate the potential effectiveness of FSC in safeguarding the ecological integrity
                     of the ecosystem. Besides spatial analysis and a field visitation, core elements of
                     the methodological procedure were workshops with experts and stakeholders who directly
                     contributed to knowledge mapping and analysis. The results of the study suggest FSC
                     can potentially influence and improve forest management including monitoring and evaluation,
                     foster the institutional capacity, and enhance knowledge on the impacts of forest
                     management. Theoretically, FSC has a certain potential to reduce a range of anthropogenic
                     threats to the ecosystem, such as large-scale deforestation and forest degradation,
                     logging of High Conservation Value Forests, large size of clear-cuts, excessive annual
                     allowable cuts, damage to trees during forest operations, and hydrological changes.
                     However, human-induced fire is the only ecological stress that was assumed to be effectively
                     tackled through a strong and positive influence of FSC. The results of the theoretical
                     analysis with a semi-quantitative evaluation revealed the potential for FSC to generate
                     much more effective outcomes for biodiversity by prudently targeting key ecological
                     problems. The biggest problem is the large-scale clear-cutting practice, especially
                     within IFL. These devastating practices are not promoted by, but are compliant with
                     the current Russian FSC standard. This feeds doubts about the consistency of FSC practice
                     and its credibility.

            <p id="d1e166">The Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) is a voluntary sustainability standard developed
               to promote responsible management of the world’s forests that is environmentally appropriate,
               socially beneficial, and economically viable [<a href="#R01">1</a>]. Based on a generic certification system with a given set of general principles
               and criteria, 46 national standards for 38 different countries have been formulated
               and approved, each with their own specific indicators, verifiers, norms, and guidance
               [<a href="#R02">2</a>]. FSC is a market-based tool that has been prepared by a multi-stakeholder group
               and is the most widely adopted forest standard, already covering 196 million hectares
               of the forest across 83 different countries worldwide [<a href="#R03">3</a>]. Motivated by ethical concerns for the environment and underpinned by the Sustainable
               Development Goals as well as international directives to safeguard biodiversity, FSC
               is regarded as a powerful instrument to achieve Sustainable Forest Management (SFM)
               [<a href="#R04">4</a>]. SFM aims to commercially use forests without compromising biodiversity, biomass
               productivity, the capacity for natural regeneration, vitality, and the functionality
               to provide ecosystem services in the long-term and without threatening other ecological
               systems [<a href="#R05">5</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e183">The concept of SFM seems to be in accordance with the requirements of the ecosystem
               approach [<a href="#R06">6</a>]; at least both pursue the same ultimate goals [<a href="#R07">7</a>]. The ecosystem approach promotes the conservation of biodiversity and sustainable
               use of natural resources taking into account the inherent dynamics and complexity
               of ecological systems [<a href="#R08">8</a>]. It acknowledges the close interrelation and interdependency of ecological and anthropogenic
               systems as well as the need for protecting biodiversity when utilizing natural resources
               [<a href="#R09">9</a>]. The reduction of present and future anthropogenic threats to biodiversity fosters
               ecosystem resilience by supporting ecosystem functionality in the long-term, and in
               doing so, increasing the ability of ecosystems to cope with perturbations and environmental
               changes [<a href="#R10">10</a>, <a href="#R11">11</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e204">Growing scientific evidence indicates that forest certification probably decreases
               social and environmental shortcomings [<a href="#R12">12</a>]. FSC members are convinced that FSC certification generates social benefits such
               as improved communication processes and the resolution of conflicts [<a href="#R13">13</a>]. For instance, FSC certification induced beneficial social outcomes in terms of
               living conditions of forest workers and benefit-sharing in the Congo basin [<a href="#R14">14</a>]. In Tanzania, FSC-certified community forests showed improved forest structure and
               forest regeneration as well as a less fire incidents [<a href="#R15">15</a>]. Nevertheless, the effects of FSC certification on the management of community forests
               are often limited and do not necessarily refer to certification itself, but to the
               emphasis of public policy and positive institutional influence [<a href="#R16">16</a>]. Regarding short-term environmental impacts, FSC certification led to a slight reduction
               in logging damage, impacts from skidding trails and roads, and loss of above-ground
               biomass in Gabon [<a href="#R17">17</a>]. In Indonesia, FSC certification decreased deforestation and air pollution and was
               associated with benefits to local communities including health issues, but still,
               forest management for timber harvesting causes ecosystem disturbance [<a href="#R18">18</a>]. Amongst three different commercial forest reserves in Malaysia, mammal species
               richness including threatened species and above-ground biomass were highest in a FSC-certified
               area [<a href="#R19">19</a>]. In Mediterranean oak woodlands, FSC had a positive effect on stream quality after
               five years by enhancing riparian vegetation [<a href="#R20">20</a>]. In a global panel analysis it was concluded that forest certification can reduce
               deforestation directly and indirectly [<a href="#R21">21</a>]. However, logging activities under FSC cannot always be associated with lower carbon
               emissions [<a href="#R22">22</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e240">More than one fifth of the world’s FSC-certified area is located within the Russian
               Federation [<a href="#R03">3</a>]. The increasing demand for certified timber together with an active promotion from
               international organisations, especially from environmental NGOs, has been the main
               driving force behind FSC certification in the Russian Federation [<a href="#R23">23</a>]. However, evidence for the environmental benefits of FSC is to be found mainly in
               the tropical and subtropical biomes. In contrast, there have been very few studies
               published on FSC practices in boreal forests, and those that have are restricted to
               EU-countries such as Sweden or Finland, and to North America. A study conducted in
               12 stands in the USA concluded that FSC-certified harvesting showed no significant
               differences at stand level in comparison to non-certified forestry, except for an
               increase in woody residues [<a href="#R24">24</a>]. In the boreal forests of the Russian Federation less evidence about the impacts
               of FSC certification was produced. Maintaining the functionality of the Russian forests
               is highly relevant, as forest cover in the Russian Federation is the most extensive
               of all the larger countries [<a href="#R25">25</a>]. In 2010, forest was estimated to cover almost 800 million hectares of the Russian
               territory [<a href="#R26">26</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e257">The taiga represents a boreal forest ecosystem encompassing the largest terrestrial
               biome on the globe, but much of the natural structures and dynamics have been heavily
               impacted by anthropogenic exploitation [<a href="#R27">27</a>]. In the production forests of the Russian Federation clear-cuts of up to 50 ha are
               allowed in accordance with the forest code [<a href="#R28">28</a>]. In more recent times, the predominantly high intensity timber logging, clear-cuttings,
               and human-induced fires have caused substantial tree cover losses and ecosystem degradation
               [<a href="#R29">29</a>]. The transformation from intact forest landscapes (IFL) to forests that are deeply
               fragmented, especially in European Russia, changed the ecology of the region and threatens
               to reduce ecosystem functionality in the long-term [<a href="#R30">30</a>]. At present, within the Arkhangelsk Region and the Komi Republic, large tracts of
               IFL remain [<a href="#R31">31</a>], but at the same time these areas continue to suffer from substantive tree cover
               loss [<a href="#R29">29</a>, <a href="#R32">32</a>]. The FSC promotes the preservation of IFL as part of high conservation value forests
               (HCVF) [<a href="#R33">33</a>]. The reduction of logging in primary forests and the identification of HCVF were
               encountered as positive environmental impacts of FSC that contribute to biodiversity
               conservation in the Russian Federation [<a href="#R23">23</a>]. Specifically, in tracts of forest managed as clear-cut, those areas spared from
               felling are important landscape elements for biodiversity and are promoted by FSC
               certification [<a href="#R34">34</a>]. Nevertheless, most studies about the impacts of FSC in the Russian Federation focus
               on issues relating to governance and society [<a href="#R35">35</a>, <a href="#R36">36</a>, <a href="#R37">37</a>, <a href="#R38">38</a>], and much less on ecological effects.

            <p id="d1e303">In this study, an ecosystem-based and participatory methodology, named ECOSEFFECT,
               is applied to systemically assess and evaluate the principles, criteria and indicators
               (PCI) of FSC and their potential for reducing recognized environmental threats to
               biodiversity that result from conventional forest management practices. ECOSEFFECT
               has been developed specifically to assess the performance of certification systems
               for the sustainable management of natural resources with a focus on maintaining ecosystem
               functionality. The Arkhangelsk Region was the chosen study site because of its relevance
               for timber supply in Europe and Russia, and also because it supports large tracts
               of intact forest, but most crucial is the recent expansion of FSC across the forest
               leaseholders. The main aim of the study was to estimate the potential benefits derived
               from implementing the PCI of FSC in the Arkhangelsk Region, and to identify eventual
               challenges and shortcomings of the standard.

                  sparsely populated [<a href="#R41">41</a>]. The economy is based predominantly on timber extraction and processing, and by
                  the beginning of the 20th century, Archangelsk was already one of the largest sawmilling

                  <!-- named anchor --></a><h3 class="section-title">2.2.- Conceptual Scope and General Methodological Approach</h3>
               <p id="d1e344">The methodological framework ECOSEFFECT (<i>ECOsystem-based assessment of Sustainability standards and their EFFECTiveness</i>), used in this study is based on MARISCO, an adaptive and proactive conservation
                  management tool [<a href="#R45">45</a>, <a href="#R46">46</a>]. The applied method is grounded in an ecosystem approach which includes the principle
                  that humans and their economic activities are an integral part of the global ecosystem
                  and depend on the full functioning of ecosystems. In the case of forests and their
                  management it becomes especially apparent that both economic and social sustainability
                  entirely depend on the functioning of the ecosystem. For this reason we postulate
                  a clear ‘hierarchy of sustainabilities’ reflecting that the sustainable existence
                  and functioning of the ecosystem is a <i>conditio sine qua non</i> for any dependent subsystem. To justify the development and use of a sustainability
                  standard for ecosystem management such as FSC requires proof of its effectiveness
                  in safeguarding the ecology and the integrity of the service-provisioning system.
                  Beneficial influences of FSC on the social and economic sphere can be important achievements,
                  which are very much appreciated, but if short-term benefits for human well-being do
                  not translate into potential ecological outcomes then they are irrelevant to our study
                  (e.g., safety requirements that lead to reduced injuries of forest workers does not
                  induce any positive impacts in the forest ecosystem [<a href="#R47">47</a>]). Nevertheless, we fully recognize the complexity inherent in nature and its relationship
                  with society. The evaluation of the benefits and gains made by applying certification
                  cannot focus solely on changes in forests and forest management operations, but also
                  requires an analytical framework that carefully considers the causal origin of outcomes
                  [<a href="#R48">48</a>]. ECOSEFFECT scrutinizes the human-induced threats to ecosystems and the ability
                  of sustainability standards to reduce the resulting ecological stresses by abating
                  the underlying drivers of negative environmental change. The human dimension, including
                  social and economic aspects, appears in the analysis as the drivers of environmental
                  change on the one hand and on the other hand human well-being is directly affected
                  by the consequences of deteriorated ecosystems. The approach taken deliberately applies
                  a systemic framework with as much of the complex situation and prevailing conditions
                  represented as possible. It pools information from experts and stakeholders, and is
                  an open-source, transparent knowledge sharing platform with the purpose of understanding
                  different view-points and angles of interpretation.

               <p id="d1e851">Ecosystem Diagnostics Analysis (EDA) is the first step in ECOSEFFECT and comprises
                  a desktop assessment of available spatial data combined with quick field visitations
                  of a designated project site or landscape. In the spatial analysis, forest cover and
                  evidence of land cover change were examined as preparation for both the conceptualisation
                  of the situation analysis and a field inspection. Data on annual tree cover loss between
                  2001 and 2014 [<a href="#R50">50</a>] was used to look at logging patterns and to calculate tree cover loss before and
                  during FSC certification, as well as in the forest landscape outside of FSC-certified
                  concessions. Maps on the spatial distribution of FSC-certified forest management units
                  (FMU) as of May 2016 [<a href="#R51">51</a>] were processed, the issue date for each certificate holder was revised according
                  to available certificates [<a href="#R52">52</a>], and the dataset was clipped with annual tree cover loss [<a href="#R50">50</a>] using the software ArcGIS [<a href="#R53">53</a>]. In the spatial analysis, the relative year in relation to the implementation of
                  FSC was computed. In particular, tree cover loss that occurred within a logging concession
                  before it was FSC-certified was classified as “before FSC”. Tree cover loss classified
                  as “during FSC” implies that the tree cover was lost while an FSC-certificate was
                  valid. Tree cover loss in the initial and final year of certification as well as tree
                  cover loss after FSC certification (altogether accounting for 12% of the dataset within
                  FSC concessions) was excluded from the analysis to reduce uncertainty, as it was unclear
                  if that particular moment of tree cover loss was recorded just before or after certification.

               <p id="d1e890">A situation analysis describes the process of systemically collecting available knowledge
                  to assess the conditions within a region of interest, including the vulnerability
                  of biodiversity, and the complex interaction of the main drivers of change. A three-day
                  workshop was launched in June 2014 close to the city of Arkhangelsk to conduct a situation
                  analysis of the Arkhangelsk Region together with 16 experts affiliated to NGOs, FSC,
                  academic research institutions, and timber companies (Table <a href="#Tab2">2</a>).
               </p>
               <p id="d1e895">Together with the findings of the previously conducted EDA, the results of the situation
                  analysis were visualised in a conceptual model presenting a systemic knowledge map
                  depicting causally interlinked factors that are responsible for shaping the actual
                  situation within the scope (Figure <a href="#Fig1">1</a>).
               </p>
               <p id="d1e900">The systemic analysis began with the identification of the main ecosystem types and
                  the fundamentals necessary to maintain full ecological function, the so-called key
                  ecological attributes (KEA). Other information imported into the conceptual model
                  include a list of aspects relating to human well-being, which is supported by ecosystem
                  services provided by functional ecosystems on the one side, and by social services
                  generated by social systems on the other side. Observable and also speculated environmental
                  stresses that represent negative impacts on biodiversity were compiled as well as
                  the contribution and interaction of the different pressures or threats that cause
                  environmental stresses. The respective drivers of threats, called contributing factors,
                  were also incorporated into the conceptual model. After cumulating and arranging all
                  elements comprising the conceptual model (Table <a href="#Tab3">3</a>), the various systemic components were interlinked according to the most logical
                  cause-effect relationships known or assumed by experts participating in the workshop
                  in order to generate a complex and complete picture of the forests and the impacts
                  of human interventions. The key question for this ‘backward-moving’ procedure detecting
                  potential causality was “Where does this come from? What are the direct drivers?”.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e905">The method described for this form of conceptual modeling relies on repeated revision
                  and refining of the analysis by the stakeholders participating in the process based
                  on their knowledge and assumptions, until the best possible representation of the
                  situation is achieved. In order to determine those elements in the system that contribute
                  most to the overall vulnerability of biodiversity, the <i>strategic relevance</i> of contributing factors, threats, and stresses was semi-quantitatively evaluated
                  by the workshop participants. It presents a cumulative measure comprising <i>criticality</i> (including <i>geographical scope, severity of impact, and irreversibility), dynamics (e.g., trend
                     of change, expected future criticality)</i>, and <i>systemic activity (in- and outgoing influence)</i> (Table <a href="#Tab3">3</a>) applying the MARISCO rating scheme [<a href="#R45">45</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e926">Elements rated as being highly relevant are those that should be prioritized by FSC
                  to initiate targeted mitigation strategies and action to restore and safeguard the
                  function of the forest environment in the long-term. The situation analysis provides
                  the fundament for the further analysis and represents the situation of forests without
                  FSC certification.

                  of FSC as <i>strategic complexes</i> that encompass a group of strategies related to a distinct thematic realm. The 56
                  FSC criteria were understood as <i>strategies</i> that are a set of activities or measures designed to deliver desirable goals and
                  objectives. Indicators of each criterion were interpreted as <i>activities</i> describing specific actions or series of decisions related to a certain strategy.

                  locations where small interventions can induce crucial changes [<a href="#R54">54</a>]. In this study they present points in the conceptual model where FSC criteria apply.
                  At this point, at least one activity of a strategy addresses a specific factor and
                  influences it in such a way as to generate one or more outcomes. The leverage points
                  of FSC were determined by seven experts made up of representatives of WWF Russia,
                  FSC Russia and FSC International, the Northern (Arctic) Federal University of Arkhangelsk
                  as well as one timber company working on the conceptual model during a three-day workshop

                  and positive influence) (Table <a href="#Tab4">4</a>).

               <p id="d1e1236">The theory of change describes a process of predetermining the outcomes derived from
                  the influence of FSC on the causally interlinked elements collected in the conceptual
                  model. The direct influence and positive transformation of factors induced by FSC
                  can potentially trigger a cascade of responses leading to a mitigation of anthropogenic
                  threats and the alleviation of environmental stresses. The reformulation of contributing
                  factors, threats and stresses was conducted in the second workshop by participating
                  experts according to their best knowledge, by experience, and logical assumptions.

               <p id="d1e1241">In a gap analysis, those elements in the conceptual model that remain unaddressed
                  by FSC as well as PCI, that do not apply to the situation in the Arkhangelsk Region,
                  were identified. Any contributing factor, threat, and environmental stress unaddressed
                  or intensified by a strategy could potentially jeopardize the effectiveness of the
                  certification system in achieving its ecological objectives. Potential limitations
                  of FSC have been identified and recommendations for improving the certification system
                  and its effectiveness were developed. This step takes into account the scope of FSC
                  in the Arkhangelsk Region that was delineated by discussing the effective range of
                  influence of the standard with focus on forest ecosystem management with experts.

               <p id="d1e1354">The Arkhangelsk Region comprises an area of around 31 million hectares of which almost
                  half is classified as forest (as of 2000) [<a href="#R50">50</a>]. The complex ecosystem mosaic of forests, rivers and mires is fragmented by roads.
                  Large tracts of managed forest are under FSC certification (Figure <a href="#Fig3">3</a>).
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1362">The implementation of FSC in the Arkhangelsk Region first started in 2004 with the
                  certification of two companies encompassing around 235 thousand hectares. FSC-certified
                  areas have been increasing up to more than 9 million hectares, leased under 41 different
                  companies in 2016 (Figure <a href="#Fig4">4</a>).
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1367">Over the years commercial logging has reshaped the natural boreal forest ecosystem
                  into a patchwork of checkerboard-like patterns created by systematic geometric clear-cutting
                  (Figure <a href="#Fig5">5</a>a).
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1372">The clear-cuts appear as geometrical rectangles, and forest roads become visible as
                  straight lines of tree cover loss, whereas larger irregular patches of tree cover
                  loss are most likely burnt sites, but could also be the results of deforestation for
                  mining activities. Due to the inaccessibility of remote forest areas and the absence
                  of local population, the small and diffuse patches of tree cover loss were not referred
                  to logging but classified as forest die-back. Examples of die-back, particularly in
                  spruce forest, were noticed in unmanaged stands during field-trips in the neighborhood
                  of clear-cuts. Across most of the study area, the systematic harvesting of timber
                  brought about a distinctive ‘checkerboard’-pattern that has been steadily increasing
                  both within and outside FSC-certified areas. [15]The consecutive, year-by-year clear-cuts
                  add up to larger continuous clear-cuts without any substantial remaining tree cover
                  that can be several square kilometers across (Figure <a href="#Fig5">5</a>b). Legal logging activities, also in FSC-certified logging concessions, have contributed
                  to a considerable decrease in the extent of IFL in 2013 in comparison to 2000 and
                  logging patterns in the example area show how the remaining IFL has been shrinking
                  in recent years and how formerly continuous tracts of forest are now fragmented and
                  can be prone to tree dieback (Figure <a href="#Fig5">5</a>c).
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1380">Between 2000 and 2014, almost one million hectares of forest in the Arkhangelsk Region
                  were affected by tree cover loss, of which more than half was recorded within the
                  concessions that were already FSC-certified or had acquired certification during this
                  period (Figure <a href="#Fig6">6</a>).
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1385">Tree cover loss was detected in 5.35% of the total area held by companies that have
                  been or are in the process of certification compared with 2.44% of forest that has
                  never been under FSC-certification (Table <a href="#Tab5">5</a>).

                  Region were identified during the expert workshops and illustrated in a conceptual
                  model (Annex 1). The ecosystem complex ‘<i>taiga of Arkhangelsk</i>’ is determined to be an umbrella <b>biodiversity object</b> encompassing 27 nested biodiversity objects. The nested objects include key species
                  of flora and fauna within the three interacting sub-ecosystems forests, mires (ombrotrophic
                  and mineralotrophic), and aquatic ecosystems. The diverse mosaic of forest ecosystems
                  comprises spruce forest, aspen forest, broad-leafed forest, karst forest, dune forest,
                  herb-rich forests and riparian forests, and supports important fauna, including soil
                  biota as well as aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1553">The workshop participants described 21 regulating, provisioning, and cultural <b>ecosystem services</b> that contribute to 11 objects of <b>human well-being</b> classified under: health, security, materials for living, and social relationships.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1561">The <b>Key Ecological Attributes</b> (KEA) consist of 11 abiotic factors relating to energy, humidity, lithosphere, wind,
                  and temperature together with 23 biotic factors classified broadly under three categories:
                  biomass (living and dead), information (genetic information), and networks (structures
                  and interrelations). Biotic and abiotic factors, but particularly those attributes
                  relating to networks and information, are found to be affected by human-induced disturbances.
                  The lithosphere and the hydrological regime would also be impacted, but in general,
                  abiotic KEA are considered to be less affected by the identified stresses than biotic
                  ones.

               <p id="d1e1580">The semi-quantitative evaluation of stresses, threats, and contributing factors by
                  experts and stakeholders suggests that all identified and rated contributing factors
                  are important or extremely important in increasing the overall vulnerability of the
                  conservation objects, which is represented by high values of <i>‘criticality’</i>. <b>Contributing factors</b> relating to governance and socio-economics, forest management, institutional capacity
                  and knowledge as well as nature protection are assumed to be the major and persistent
                  drivers of negative changes in the taiga of the Arkhangelsk Region. The <b>threats</b> that are rated highest for criticality are linked to problems of <i>“Deforestation and forest degradation”, “Infrastructure within the forest”</i>, the <i>“Construction of non-forest roads”</i>, and <i>“Extreme weather events”</i>. The problem of large-scale clear-cuts (<i>“Too big size of clear-cut”</i>), which in turn links up to <i>“Harvesting in HCVF, including intact forests”</i>, and <i>“Forest infrastructure”</i> is recorded as highly critical to the long-term security of biodiversity.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1610">One third of all identified <b>stresses</b> are considered to be very critical symptoms of negative impacts. In particular, <i>“Contamination of surface and underground water”, “Decrease of natural forest regeneration”,
                     “Dissociation of populations - gene flow”, “Change of forest age distribution - less
                     very old trees”, “More homogenous and contrast spatial structure”, “Diversity of forest
                     ecosystem is reduced”, “Number of habitat is reduced”, “Vulnerable species extinction”,
                     “Change of wood species - changed cycles”</i>, and <i>“Changed routes of animal migration”</i> are rated as extremely important stresses.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1621">Most of the rated elements are estimated to be moderately relevant. Apart from three
                  contributing factors, none of the other factors, threats or stresses is rated as being
                  highly relevant. Almost one fourth of all the contributing factors and less than one
                  third of threats are recorded as being highly relevant (Figure <a href="#Fig7">7</a>).

               <p id="d1e1633">The three most strategically relevant contributing factors identified in the workshop
                  are linked to governance and include <i>“Too many norms, legislations &amp; regulations”, “Poor legislation &amp; guidelines”</i> as well as the institutional factor <i>“Lack of long-term multipurpose planning”</i>. This suggests ambiguous and contradictory legal instruments and governance, together
                  with insufficient specifications, hamper the effective implementation of ecologically
                  relevant legislations. The strategically most relevant threats refer to large-scale
                  forest degradation, infrastructure, landform configuration, and climate change. Changes
                  to the natural structure and character of habitats are considered to be the most strategically
                  relevant stresses including <i>“More homogenous and contrast spatial structure”, “Diversity of forest ecosystem is
                     reduced”</i>, and <i>“Number of habitat is reduced”</i>. The stated causes of natural habitat destruction given by the participants are manifold;
                  the most important ones relate to forest management practices and the need for accessibility
                  by roads.

               <p id="d1e1650">According to the experts and stakeholders, FSC strategies target more than 75% of
                  all identified contributing factors directly. Most of the contributing factors are
                  addressed only once, but several strategies refer to the same contributing factor
                  several times (Figure <a href="#Fig8">8</a>).
                  
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1655">In total, 104 points in the conceptual model are leveraged on 29 different contributing
                  factors by 39 different strategies. Two contributing factors, namely <i>“Poor law enforcement”</i> and <i>“Failure to involve stakeholders”</i>, are targeted most often and addressed by 11 different strategies. The estimated
                  influence of the strategies ranges from weak and negative to strong and positive,
                  whilst most strategies appear to influence contributing factors in a weak and positive
                  way (Figure <a href="#Fig9">9</a>).
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1666">All contributing factors that are rated as being highly and very highly strategically
                  relevant are addressed by FSC, whereas the two strategically relevant contributing
                  factors <i>“Inadequate government control (of nature use)”</i> and <i>“Mining”</i>, as well as the two strategically less relevant factors <i>“Wish to make quick money”</i> and <i>“Violations of technological regulations”</i>, are understandably not covered by FSC (Figure <a href="#Fig10">10</a>).
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1683">Most of the strategies derived from the FSC criteria are assumed to target one or
                  several of the contributing factors. A total of 17 strategies (including nine based
                  on criteria describing principle 10: “Plantations”) do not target any of the threats
                  or contributing factors in the conceptual model. Some of the strategies are seen to
                  relate more often to certain contributing factors than others. For example, criterion
                  1.6 (“Long-term commitment to FSC Principles and Criteria”) is mapped most frequently
                  and leveraged 11 factors. Three criteria, criterion 1.1 (“Respect all national &amp; local
                  laws and administrative requirements”), criterion 6.1 (“Complete Environmental Impact
                  Assessment and integrate into management”), and criterion 6.2 (“Safeguards to protect
                  rare, threatened and endangered species and their habitats; establish conservation
                  zones and protection areas; control inappropriate hunting, fishing, trapping and collecting”),
                  are referred to seven different contributing factors (Figure <a href="#Fig11">11</a>).

               <p id="d1e1719">The following paragraphs present the results for the assessment of the potential outcomes
                  of action triggered by FSC certification according to the postulated theory change
                  (Annex 5). The scope of certification embraces the total leased area rather than including
                  just selected sites. Consequently, all potential outcomes would have to apply to all
                  FSC-certified logging concessions.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1721">Within the group of <b>contributing factors</b> linked to governance, FSC criterion 1.1 targets each of the contributing factors
                  relating to legislation in a positive but weak way. In theory, the negative influence
                  attributed to strategically relevant ineffective norms and the current legislation
                  relating to forests and forestry are supposed to be reduced. The strategically relevant
                  factor <i>“Corruption”</i> is considered to be reduced by the weak but positive influence of three different
                  FSC criteria designed to enhance the documentation of legislative requirements and
                  long-term land-use rights. Theoretically, FSC would lead to the provision of effective
                  and clear legislation for responsible forest management, based on the given guidelines
                  for road and bridge construction, and the contribution to a more stringent enforcement
                  of administrative regulations. Illegal activities, including illegal logging, are
                  assumed to be prevented under FSC. The rights, as well as all health and safety requirements
                  of workers are believed to be respected. All kinds of applicable payments are supposed
                  to be documented and promptly paid. The attendance by staff on training in the proper
                  implementation of FSC and on forest management planning would, hypothetically enhance
                  their level of knowledge, expertise, and proficiency. The expectation would be for
                  clear and obvious compliance with laws and international treaties ratified by the
                  Russian Federation.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1729">According to the experts, all factors relating to forest management would be directly
                  influenced by various FSC criteria. As a possible outcome, the management objectives
                  of a certified company would be defined in the long-term, at least for a minimum of
                  five years. Poor forest management is expected to improve in certified forest companies
                  by amending the forest management plans according to the findings of an Environmental
                  Impact Assessment (EIA). In theory, the EIA would be conducted and a forest monitoring
                  system would be established according to the guidelines anchored in the FSC standard.
                  Moreover, it is assumed an economic analysis would be conducted and the findings incorporated
                  into the forest management plan. A monitoring program is supposed to be established,
                  being clearly documented, consistent, replicable, and regularly revised by the FSC-certified
                  forest companies. Deviations from the management plan and discrepancies between actual
                  and expected results would be assessed and considered in the revision of the management
                  plan. It is presumed that transparency would be enhanced through the publication of
                  management documents and monitoring results for certified companies, except in cases
                  where confidentiality is required. Consequently, the quality of available information
                  would be enhanced, including environmental, economic, and social aspects of forestry
                  as well as improved access to information on natural resources for planning purposes.
                  In addition, FSC is expected to deliver improvements in the availability of data on
                  yields, growth rates, forest composition, regeneration, and changes in the composition
                  of flora and fauna.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1731">The analysis concludes that FSC would lead to a reduction of logging in primary or
                  old-growth forests. In theory, FSC requires HCVF areas to be identified and considered
                  in the planning and the implementation process of forest management operations. Stakeholders,
                  such as local people, authorities, administrations, and forest managers would be technically
                  consulted, especially in the frame of a social impact analysis. Land-use rights for
                  indigenous people and their access to natural resources are requirements for companies
                  operating under FSC. The interests of local communities extend to unrestricted access
                  to timber and non-timber forest resources. In principle, the FSC PCI are designed
                  to reduce the risk of disputes and grievances between local communities and commercial
                  companies, and in part, this is achieved through an anticipated enhancement in environmental
                  and social awareness amongst forest workers and staff by providing training, and by
                  employing predominantly local people with strong concerns for the forest and its natural
                  resources.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1733">In theory, the planning and implementation of forest management under FSC takes into
                  account international treaties as well as conventions on biodiversity conservation
                  and protected areas. For example, the identification, monitoring, and protection of
                  rare, threatened and endangered species, key habitats, and HCVF would be developed
                  by researchers and in consultation with specialists and other stakeholders, and then
                  implemented by the certified company. Thus, in theory, it is assumed that HCVF and
                  undisturbed areas would be protected from forestry activities and buffer zones would
                  be established around sensitive sites. Under FSC, water protection zones would be
                  maintained and riparian areas that have been degraded by forest operations would be
                  restored. Moreover, a network of representative examples of existing ecosystems is
                  supposed to be established and management restrictions observed. The effectiveness
                  of conservation measures on HCVF would be assessed annually by the certified company.
                  Participants assume that under FSC, the annual allowable cut (AAC) is calculated sustainably.
                  Forest operations would take account of economically inaccessible regions and areas
                  where logging is restricted, such as in HCVF. The rationale for the calculation of
                  AAC and planned harvesting level is expected to be provided in the management plan
                  of FSC-certified logging companies. The financial resources needed to implement the
                  forest management plan would be available at certified companies. As a potential result,
                  it is postulated that forest management would be conducted according to the management
                  plan and any negative environmental impacts due to forest operations described as
                  “cut-and-go practice” are reduced.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1735">FSC promotes the use of all merchantable woody resources and the diversification of
                  utilized and processed forest products. Thus, it is assumed that a FSC-certified forest
                  company would optimize their expenses by an effective economic analysis being incorporated
                  into the management plan. Data on costs, productivity, and efficiency of the forest
                  management are supposed to be collected and analyzed by FSC-certified forest companies.
                  This is expected to result in high profitability and economic sustainability that
                  would also contribute to stabilizing the local economy. As a theoretical result, income
                  opportunities for the local population are enhanced by getting the chance of an employment
                  in the forestry sector and the possibility to increase incomes of forest workers by
                  negotiating with their employers. The illegal use of natural resources would be banned
                  under FSC.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1737">The changes to contributing factors by FSC are assumed to initiate a strong and positive
                  influence on 45%, and a weak and positive influence on 30%, of the identified threats.
                  All of the strategically least relevant threats are anticipated to have a stong influence
                  in a positive way (Figure <a href="#Fig12">12</a>).
                  
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1742">Half of the threats believed by the participants to be strategically relevant, in
                  theory, are, likely to be influenced by FSC in a weak and positive way, whilst 17%
                  are considered to be effected in a strong and positive way. For each of the targeted
                  threats, threat-reduction-results are formulated (Annex 6). Only one of the threats,
                  namely <i>“Gathering of forest litter”</i>, is assumed to be negatively influenced due to the diversification and optimal use
                  of forest that increases the collection of forest residues. A strong and positive
                  influence is postulated for 60% of the identified threats. The strong and positive
                  influence of FSC is assumed to mitigate all identified threats leading to large-scale
                  tree cover loss. In theory, the strong positive influence of FSC would reduce the
                  size of clear-cut patches and also decrease the percentage of clear-cuttings, prevent
                  logging in HCVF, reduce the deterioration of soil quality, avert the change of soil
                  composition and hydro melioration, lower the excess of allowed cut during selective
                  logging, induce selective logging without damaging trees, and foster a more sustainable
                  use of non-timber forest products. Potentially, the identified negative impacts of
                  infrastructure on the forest ecosystem induced by the construction of new roads and
                  bridges would be slightly reduced. Moreover, the weak and positive influence of FSC
                  requirements would reduce the overexploitation of timber resources and encourage negotiations
                  as well as agreements between the certified forest company and communities about the
                  location of pastures. Moreover, changes in the hydrological regime are supposed to
                  be avoided, and water quality would be maintained.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1747">The anticipated reduction of perceived threats to the forest environment is estimated
                  to reduce almost half of all identified stresses (Annex 7). Most of the stresses are
                  anticipated to be moderately reduced. The three most relevant stresses are expected
                  to be influenced in a weak and positive way (Figure <a href="#Fig13">13</a>).
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1752">One single potential stress-reduction result, namely <i>“Reduced anthropogenic forest fires”</i>, being rated as less strategically relevant, is transformed through a strong positive
                  influence of FSC. The presumed reduction of tree cover loss in HCVF, key habitats,
                  and representative samples of ecosystems would contribute to a loss of habitat for
                  forest-dwelling species in general, but forest operations and habitat degradation
                  would continue elsewhere within the concession.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1758">FSC certification does not specifically require the restoration of degraded forests.
                  The homogeneity and loss of forest diversity are assumed to be reduced by the promotion
                  of smaller and fewer clear-cuts, and retaining mature and old trees in primary forests
                  under the FSC regime. The potential for regeneration in logged forests is supposed
                  to be improved by supporting natural rejuvenation and retention of seed-trees. The
                  extinction of vulnerable species and the disturbance of forest fauna would be possibly
                  reduced where rare, threatened and endangered species and their habitats are identified
                  and where protection or restoration measures are implemented. The intensity of flooding
                  is supposed to be reduced by retaining or restoring riparian vegetation. The quality
                  of water would improve thanks to reduced pollution after FSC-certification.

               <p id="d1e1777">Four of the identified contributing factors are assumed to be out of the scope of
                  FSC. In particular, <i>“Mining”, “Agricultural activities”, “Global human population growth”</i>, and <i>“Increasing global resource demand”</i> are neither directly nor indirectly related to forest management. Those contributing
                  factors are not directly manageable by applying forest management strategies and are
                  not addressed by the PCI. All identified threats, apart from the climate change related
                  threat <i>“Extreme weather events”</i>, are supposed to be impacted by forest management operations and could potentially
                  be strategically influenced by forest certification.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1788">The gap analysis revealed that <i>“Inadequate government control (of nature use)”</i> and the introduction of exotic fauna, together with the disruptions they can cause
                  to forest ecosystems, as well as <i>“Overhunting”</i> of animals (except for those species identified as rare, threatened or endangered)
                  would remain unaddressed by FSC. FSC targets the negative impacts of infrastructure
                  construction and the reduction of negative impacts of existing infrastructure on biodiversity,
                  but only inside designated IFL.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1796">FSC does not address forest fragmentation and isolation outside IFL and HCVF, including
                  areas that are voluntarily spared from felling, inaccessible or unprofitable for timber
                  extraction. According to the Russian FSC standard, timber-logging companies are not
                  required to alter the systematic and extensive felling of trees according to the prevailing
                  ‘checkerboard system’. Large-scale forest degradation is likely to continue unless
                  there is active conservation planning to establish wildlife corridors at a scale appropriate
                  for the needs of large mammals such as elk, bear, wolf and wild reindeer. Continuing
                  with current practices in forest management, even under FSC certification, is predicted
                  to disadvantage large mammal populations and to contribute further to ecosystem degradation.
                  Changes in the migration routes of the larger mammals are addressed indirectly by
                  FSC through the specifications for HCVF, representative ecosystems, and through ecological
                  networks.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1798">All criteria and indicators associated with principle 10 (<i>“Plantations”</i>) do not apply to the situation analysis, as all forestry in Arkhangelsk Oblast is
                  carried out in primary and secondary forest landscapes. In the situation analysis,
                  the conventional forest management scenario is described with no reference to potential
                  conflicts between FSC PCI and national legislation. As a result, criterion 1.4 (<i>“Conflicts between laws, regulations and the FSC Principles and Criteria shall be
                     evaluated for the purposes of certification, on a case by case basis, by the certifiers
                     and the involved or affected parties”</i>) does not apply.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1806">The matter relating to forest employees is not recognized by the workshop participants
                  as an issue likely to affect the ecology of the forest, and this is reflected in the
                  analysis. The specific FSC criterion 4.3 (<i>“The rights of workers to organize and voluntarily negotiate with their employers
                     shall be guaranteed as outlined in Conventions 87 and 98 of the International Labor
                     Organization (ILO)”</i>) does not address any of the threats and contributing factors in the conceptual model.
                  Another example of non-coverage by FSC standards relates to the use of pesticides.
                  In the case of Arkhangelsk, there is no pest management. For this reason, criterion
                  6.6 (<i>“Management systems shall promote the development and adoption of environmentally
                     friendly non-chemical methods of pest management and strive to avoid the use of chemical
                     pesticides. World Health Organization Type 1A and 1B and chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticides;
                     pesticides that are persistent, toxic or whose derivatives remain biologically active

                     banned by international agreement, shall be prohibited. If chemicals are used, proper
                     equipment and training shall be provided”</i>) and criterion 6.8. (<i>“Use of biological control agents shall be documented, minimized, monitored and strictly
                     controlled in accordance with national laws and internationally accepted scientific
                     protocols. Use of genetically modified organisms shall be prohibited”</i>) do not relate to any of the threats and contributing factors recorded by the participants.
                  Similarly, exotic species are not addressed by forest management operations in Arkhangelsk,
                  and so, criterion 6.9. (<i>“The use of exotic species shall be carefully controlled and actively monitored to
                     avoid adverse ecological impacts”</i>) is not mapped into the conceptual model. Criterion 6.10 (<i>“Forest conversion to plantations or non-forest land uses shall not occur, except
                     in circumstances where conversion: a) entails a very limited portion of the forest

            <p id="d1e1833">The findings of this study are broadly in line with the outcomes of previous research
               carried out on the effectiveness of FSC in that compliance with FSC standards has
               the potential to influence substantially most activities associated with commercial
               forestry [<a href="#R56">56</a>]. Previous assessments on the effectiveness of FSC using interviews and questionnaires
               concluded there was a positive ecological benefit to forest biodiversity and ecosystem
               integrity from FSC [<a href="#R57">57</a>]. In our conceptual model of the Arkhangelsk Region, a considerable proportion of
               contributing factors relating to forest management, including monitoring and evaluation
               but also the institutions’ capacity and knowledge, were assumed to be transformed
               towards the better by FSC. Consequently, following the theory of change, FSC has the
               potential to reduce a range of anthropogenic threats such as large-scale deforestation,
               logging in HCVF and intact forests, large clear-cuts, excessive AAC, tree damage,
               and hydrological changes. However, the reduction of human-induced forest fires was
               assumed to be the only stress abated effectively.
               
            </p>
            <p id="d1e1841">The semi-quantitative evaluation of the FSC-induced influence, as estimated during
               the theoretical plausibility analysis, suggests that FSC could produce even more effective
               outcomes for biodiversity by targeting identified problems more specifically and precisely
               in order to generate a strong and positive influence on relevant drivers of negative
               environmental impacts. Quite a few FSC-induced measures seem to induce rather minor
               improvements. For instance, the concept of safeguarding biodiversity by adopting a
               ‘set-aside’ area such as HCVF is in contrast to more contemporary thinking that advocates
               the ecosystem-based approach targeting functional landscape ecosystems rather than
               small even though representative patches. The protection of parts of commercially
               used forests with high conservation values and key biotopes by FSC is important for
               biodiversity conservation in Russia [<a href="#R58">58</a>]. However, the size and quality of HCVF were found to be much more related to the
               scale and type of tenure but were also regarded as a means of demonstrating compliance
               with existing legislation for designated protected species, and not for maintaining
               or promoting ecosystem function [<a href="#R59">59</a>]. A more in-depth analysis and evidence-based study is recommended to determine the
               effectiveness of current HCVF in reducing biodiversity loss and maintaining ecosystem
               functionality, especially in the boreal zone. More specific guidance for forest managers
               on the control and restoration of habitats, including riparian vegetation and wildlife
               corridors is strongly recommended.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e1849">A key finding is that the participatory situation analysis does not entirely match
               with findings gathered from the spatial analyses and field visitations. According
               to the conceptual model developed by the workshop participants, large-scale clear-cuts
               present a key problem of unsustainable forestry practices in the region. Apart from
               fragmenting habitats and reducing populations of organisms, this creates massive impacts
               on soil and hydrology, leads to large-scale land cover change and is likely to change
               micro- and mesoclimate. The clear-cuts do not resemble large-scale natural disturbance
               such as forest fires. Fires do not lead to almost complete loss of biomass and nutrients,
               and do not mechanically change the soils – as industrialized timber mining does. FSC
               PCI would encourage small-scale, close to nature practices of harvesting that would
               mimic natural gap dynamics in boreal forests. This is not supported by the spatial
               analysis and site visits, which indicated substantial clear-cuts of 50 hectares or
               more, after a few years covering much larger areas of consecutively cleared forest.
               The conventional ‘checkerboard’ clear-cutting continues even after certification,
               and clearly progresses into IFL as shown for the example area. The loss of tree cover
               under certification appears to increase over time in response to a greater up-take
               of certification by commercial companies operating in the field. Our analysis does
               not suggest that FSC certification promotes large-scale clear-cutting in primary forests,
               but equally, there is no evidence for either a decrease or avoidance of large-scale
               degradation of forest cover in certified areas. Theoretically, deviations observed
               from expected outcomes can also be related to an incomplete implementation of FSC
               criteria and indicators. This would be corrected during the audits. Indeed, more than
               half of the so called corrective action requests (CAR) that were raised during FSC
               audits were related to environmental issues [<a href="#R60">60</a>]. However, the key problem of large-scale clear-cuts in primary forests seems to
               be compliant with the Russian standard which gives reasons for serious concerns.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e1854">The continued practice of large-scale clear-cuts has far reaching consequences for
               the forest environment. In particular, it causes long-term degradation to soils and
               the hydrological regime, and also affects local climatic conditions. The complex ecosystem
               with its mosaic of mires, peats, and water systems contributes substantially to the
               resilience of the planet, specifically, they contribute to the global temperature
               balance [<a href="#R61">61</a>] and store huge amounts of carbon [<a href="#R62">62</a>]. However, the boreal is also a deeply vulnerable ecosystem, responding rapidly to
               human disturbance. Most of the fires in recent times can be attributed to human activity,
               and also the change in fire frequency and intensity that threatens the survival and
               resilience capability of the boreal zone. Regarding climate change, FSC refers to
               the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and whilst certain criteria
               target climate change mitigation by restricting forest conversion (6.10), reducing
               erosion (6.5), and supporting forest regeneration (6.3 and 8.2), a more specific guidance
               on developing and adopting climate change adaptation measures is urgently needed to
               foster sustainable development and to ensure the provision of ecosystem services by
               the boreal forest of the Arkhangelsk Region in the long-term. The findings of our
               spatial analysis are in line with recent studies from other continents that found
               no or very limited effects of certification on halting tree cover loss [<a href="#R18">18</a>, <a href="#R48">48</a>, <a href="#R63">63</a>, <a href="#R64">64</a>]. Especially in the case of poor forest governance, forest certification alone cannot
               limit deforestation [<a href="#R65">65</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e1878">The disparity between theory and reality revealed in this study underpins the need
               for generating measurable indicators along the postulated cause-effect chains following
               the theory of change induced by FSC certification. By employing a definitive set of
               indicators as part of a complementary empirical assessment of FSC practice in the
               field, it should be possible to effectively assess the benefits and drawbacks of the
               certification scheme.

               <!-- named anchor --></a><h2 class="main-title">5.- Conclusions</h2>
            <p id="d1e1883">The theoretical plausibility analysis revealed that FSC is able to address various
               elements critical for the effective functioning of forest ecosystems in the Arkhangelsk
               Region. However, any perceived benefits on forest management were, according to the
               theoretical assessment, deemed to be weak and likely to result in ineffective outcomes
               for safeguarding biodiversity and ecosystem services in the long-term. An ecosystem-based
               forest management, which is specially tailored to the present situation, is highly
               recommended, under certification or not. The postulated success in reducing identified
               environmental threats and stresses through a smaller size of clear-cuts, more selective
               logging, and harvesting in secondary forests needs further investigation and evidence
               on the ground, including additional spatial analysis.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e1885">Sustainability standards that are unable to translate principles into effective action
               with measurable outputs will fail in meeting intended objectives of safeguarding the
               environment and securing human well-being. The discrepancy between the guidance provided
               by the PCI and its interpretation by certification bodies and the implementation on
               the ground are noted even within the FSC itself [<a href="#R13">13</a>]. Inevitably, the setup of certification systems reflects the philosophy and expertise
               of its designers [<a href="#R66">66</a>]. In the case of FSC, the three chamber system was designed to balance ecological,
               economic and social impacts of certification. Actually, this is not compatible with
               an ecosystem approach that accepts that humans and their activities are dependent
               components of the ecosystem, which therefore must be kept functional by all means.
               Recent FSC decisions on rejecting ‘Motions’ such as the “Landscape Approach to Protect
               Intact Forest Landscapes at the Landscape Level” (Motion GA2017/17, FSC 2017) at the
               general assembly 2017 in Vancouver, Canada, give the impression that the development
               of relevant ecological issues can easily be outvoted by one of the other chambers
               [<a href="#R67">67</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e1896">The modus operandi of FSC based on the development of national interpretations of
               the global principles and criteria seems to provide a solid fundament for creating
               an effective, regionally adequate sustainability standard. But there is no evidence
               that beyond the audits of certified companies or concessions, FSC systematically compiles
               overarching assessments on certification effectiveness for further development of
               the various national standards. The franchising-like approach, where a good part of
               the responsibility for the national standards is delegated to national experts influenced
               by the corresponding conceptual and legal frameworks, does not allow for consistency
               and credibility of the standard. The simple fact that, according to the Russian FSC
               standard (and legislation), it seems to be acceptable to exploit primeval forests
               by creating large-scale clear-cuts, seriously undermines the credibility of FSC.
