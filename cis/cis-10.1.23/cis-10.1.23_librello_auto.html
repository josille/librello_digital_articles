                                 and adjacent to Ecological Economics engages with, yet organizations that recognize
                                 this social ecological imperative have few options for funding and implementing radical
                                 transformations to the needs and well-being provisioning systems that currently exist.
                                 Ecological macroeconomic ideas and EE principles of long term well being and justice
                                 on a livable planet will be explored in the context of the housing crisis in Canada,
                                 and a rural Ontario community organization attempting to find transformative solutions
                                 to the lived, local experience of this crisis. Provisioning systems for housing, when
                                 tied to real estate markets, debt money creation, land enclosures, and financialized
                                 supply chains, contribute to capital accumulation cycles; it is hardly possible to
                                 meet our housing needs, in aggregate, without also perpetuating the form of this provisioning
                                 system. The idea presented here, that of Capital Sequestration, proposes to remove
                                 capital from markets and `invests' this capital in land trusts as an intentional transformation
                                 of financial capital into social and ecological values. Through land and housing trusts
                                 as well as non-market funding pathways, Capital Sequestration is a method of investing
                                 in the transformation of provisioning systems through the sustained and collective
                                 boundary management of financial markets and incommensurable values. This practice
                                 offers significant promise as it applies ecological macroeconomic theory work, is
                                 grounded in the normative goals of and emerges from empirical research of EE, and
                                 meets a pressing need within society for imagining alternative economies.</span></div>

                              <p id="d1e92">We are faced, as we have been for the last four decades, with a Global Ecological
                                 Crisis (GEC) in the form of climate change, increasing social inequality, environmental
                                 injustice, loss of biodiversity, massive species extinction, and more. In 2018, the
                                 IPCC report [<a href="#R1">1</a>] called for ‘‘rapid, far reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society’’
                                 including the (re)negotiating of values, fairness, justice, and well-being. This confirms
                                 the need for the systemic structural change that frontline communities, activists,
                                 and climate scientists have long been calling for [<a href="#R2">2</a>]. In addition to this system transformation that many within Ecological Economics
                                 (EE) position their research in relationship to, the current popular calls for ‘building
                                 back better’, ‘a new normal’, or ‘a new future’ in the wake of the global coronavirus
                                 pandemic has brought the prospect of bold policy and social changes to the forefront
                                 of public, private, and academic spaces. The challenge of engaging in participatory
                                 transformation of the provisioning systems that constitute our economies presents
                                 an opportunity to bring the systems-based, justice oriented, ecologically-informed
                                 research and proposals of EE into policy discussions and application.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e100">Tied to rising social inequalities are the lived impacts such as housing crises, homelessness,
                                 addiction and mental health issues, and more. As in most high-income countries with
                                 rising income inequality [<a href="#R3">3</a>], Canada has a housing crisis that has long been identified as a policy priority,
                                 yet has seen very little shift in outcomes in the last decades [<a href="#R4">4</a>]. Most attempts at ‘solving’ the housing crisis treat homelessness and precarious
                                 housing as a mere housing market failure, and attempt to create a non-market ‘bridge’
                                 for people to enter the housing market. This centres and reinforces a real estate
                                 market that clearly does not provide sufficient well-being for enough of the peoples
                                 of Canada. Advocates for transforming the housing provisioning system or for degrowth-compatible
                                 housing struggle with financing truly non-market solutions to homelessness and precarious
                                 housing [<a href="#R5">5</a>, <a href="#R6">6</a>]. Applying Ecological Macroeconomic theory and EE principles to housing provisioning
                                 systems as participatory, community-led transformation of this aspect of society brings
                                 into focus pathways to degrowth and post growth many have long envisioned.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e114">Here I propose a concept of Capital Sequestration as a method of investing in the
                                 transformation of provisioning systems through the sustained and collective boundary
                                 management of financial markets and incommensurable values. This practice offers significant
                                 promise as it applies ecological macroeconomic theory work, is grounded in the normative
                                 goals of and emerges from empirical research of EE, and meets a pressing need within
                                 society for imagining alternative economies.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e116">To explore this idea, we will focus on housing provisioning systems, the housing crisis
                                 in Canada, and proposed solutions from both a mainstream and social ecological perspective.
                                 We will begin with some background defining the critical work this concept draws upon
                                 and connects with. Next, an ecological macroeconomic analysis of the housing crisis
                                 as well as the solutions will be elaborated on and the emerging concept of Capital
                                 Sequestration will be discussed.

                                    <p id="d1e124">Ecological Economics is a transdisicplinary research and scholarship community that
                                       identifies ‘‘the economy’’ as the name we give to the way we acquire, process, and
                                       distribute what we need and want for our lives [<a href="#R7">7</a>]. This economy is embedded in society and in the biosphere in ways that cannot be
                                       conceptually isolated from the ecological relations this implies. Arising from this
                                       empirical grounding in ecological systems is the normative position that the human
                                       economy should be explicitly oriented in policy and institutional spheres towards
                                       meeting needs for long term well-being and justice on a livable planet. This has many
                                       implications for research, scholarship, and policy that continue to be explored by

                                    <p id="d1e129">While there is discussion about what <i>exactly</i> the common principles of EE are [<a href="#R8">8</a>, <a href="#R9">9</a>], I identify the EE lens, based on these discussions, to be: 1) taking a systems
                                       approach to understanding the complexity of social and ecological relations, 2) the
                                       incommensurability or non-substitutability of values, 3) the subject of meaningful
                                       inquiry having many scales from the individual human to communities to bioregions
                                       to the global macroeconomy, 4) research that is empirically informed, 5) the embracing
                                       of normativity, and 6) recognizing the finite limits of planetary systems. Social
                                       Ecological Economics has been identified as a sub-field of EE that considers these
                                       principles to constitute a distinct macroeconomic and onto-epistemological perspective,
                                       and engages with theory development as part of a research agenda [<a href="#R9">9</a>, <a href="#R10">10</a>, <a href="#R11">11</a>]. Much of the empirical research conducted since the origin of EE in the 1980s has
                                       contributed to establishing the case for the broadly accepted EE policy goal of degrowth
                                       towards a post growth or steady state economy with a lower throughput of materials
                                       and energy.

                                    <p id="d1e150">Degrowth is defined as a ‘‘voluntary transition towards a just, participatory, and
                                       ecologically sustainable society’’ [<a href="#R12">12</a>] through the ‘‘planned reduction of energy and resource throughput designed to bring
                                       the human economy back into balance with the living world in a way that reduces inequality
                                       and improves human well-being’’ [<a href="#R13">13</a>]. Whatever name we give to future economies, economic growth as it is understood
                                       and characterized today is unsustainable, thus ‘post growth’ and ‘steady state’ are
                                       often used to name the time after a process of degrowth to a scale of throughput within
                                       ecological limits. I use the term ‘post growth’ to differentiate from today’s growth
                                       oriented public policy approach to a time when economic growth is no longer the primary
                                       economic policy goal of governance bodies. I use degrowth and post growth together
                                       because the proposals dealt with in this article have relevance for both de- and post-
                                       growth, but this is not always the case and these are not interchangeable terms. There
                                       is a rich body of literature as to the distinctions between the two [<a href="#R12">12</a>, <a href="#R14">14</a>], with degrowth having a more explicitly northern hemisphere, normative, and justice
                                       orientation [<a href="#R6">6</a>, <a href="#R14">14</a>], with degrowth having a more explicitly northern hemisphere, normative, and justice
                                       orientation [<a href="#R6">6</a>, <a href="#R13">13</a>] than post growth theorizing which may be said to incorporate a more broad macroeconomic
                                       space that includes ‘‘degrowth, agrowth, steady state, and post-development thinking’’
                                       [<a href="#R14">14</a>]. Degrowth is understood within EE as a required process primarily because of the
                                       empirically demonstrated inability to decouple fossil fuel based carbon emissions
                                       from economic growth within meaningful time frames [<a href="#R1">1</a>, <a href="#R15">15</a>, <a href="#R16">16</a>].

                                    <p id="d1e190">One of the core ideas of EE is that of value incommensurability, which is to say that
                                       there are a number of sources of flows of value such as human labor, social practices,
                                       the ecologies of the biosphere, built infrastructure, and money, and these flows of
                                       value are not fully substitutable to one another. These are often named as capitals:
                                       human capital, social capital, natural capital, manufactured capital, and financial
                                       capital; capital being a way of looking at the world and understanding value/s. The
                                       distinctions made between weak and strong sustainability in early debates within EE
                                       revolved around the commensurability of these capitals, with the recognition that
                                       the substitutability of any of these capitals for any other is limited if we also
                                       recognize the finiteness of the biosphere and the thresholds for resilience in ecological
                                       systems [<a href="#R17">17</a>]. This value incommensurability led to the identification of ‘critical’ natural capital
                                       as the form of natural capital that must be protected from market exposure, commodification,
                                       and a process of financial valuation only [<a href="#R17">17</a>]. The utility of naming these as capitals is contested and debatable, and often hinges
                                       on what one thinks the definition of capital itself is. Daly and Farley [<a href="#R18">18</a>] have defined capital as ‘‘a stock that yields a flow of goods or services’’ which
                                       generally echoes other heterodox economics traditions, in which capital is described
                                       as: ‘‘any income-generating asset that generates some benefit, including income’’
                                       [<a href="#R19">19</a>], the production process itself [<a href="#R19">19</a>], or how Marx [<a href="#R20">20</a>] quite famously put it: value in motion. For the purposes of this discussion, I am
                                       using capital to mean the sources of flows of value, and I will use the terms social
                                       and ecological value instead of social or natural capital, and will continue to use
                                       the term financial capital.

                                    <p id="d1e214">Ecological Macroeconomic Theory (EMT) and model development hinge around the normative
                                       EE goals of how to manage an economy without constant growth in resource and energy
                                       throughput while also meeting needs for justice and well-being [<a href="#R21">21</a>]. Ropke [<a href="#R22">22</a>] suggests that EMT must present a ‘third way’ in contrast to neoclassical austerity
                                       policies and growth-oriented Keynesian approaches that dominate macroeconomic thinking
                                       today. Mainstream macroeconomic concerns are often productivity, employment, consumption,
                                       public spending and output, while EMT proposals by Jackson and Victor [<a href="#R23">23</a>] seek to add financial stability, the distribution of income and wealth, and resource
                                       use/flows to these concerns. Models and theory, while they engage with the same normative
                                       goals, are distinct. Macroecononic models are generally national scale economic models
                                       tied directly to state governance and concerns [<a href="#R23">23</a>], while macroeconomic theory, on the other hand, is engaged with whole system perspectives
                                       on total resource use and flows, and social, cultural, and political processes that
                                       structure economies [<a href="#R24">24</a>], which includes but is not restricted to nation states.

                                    <p id="d1e231">As economist Sheila Dow [<a href="#R25">25</a>] has said, the variables that are selected as focal points reveal a lot about macroeconomic
                                       approaches themselves. In the context of EE, the systems of provision approach originally
                                       articulated by Fine &amp; Leopold [<a href="#R26">26</a>, <a href="#R27">27</a>] and adapted in the work of Roepke and Plank et al [<a href="#R22">22</a>, <a href="#R28">28</a>], is a systems approach to macroeconomic inquiry. Provisioning systems are understood
                                       as both physical and social systems such as infrastructure, technology, markets, and
                                       institutions that connect with investment, production, processing, politics, lock-in,
                                       practices, consumption, and waste of particular systems, whether for goods or services.
                                       These provisioning systems deliver the ‘satisfiers of human needs’ and have been used
                                       by researchers in food regime theory [<a href="#R29">29</a>], commodity studies [<a href="#R30">30</a>], and EE [<a href="#R28">28</a>, <a href="#R31">31</a>] as a means to understand ‘‘the transferring of symbolic value’’ [<a href="#R32">32</a>]. Provisioning systems are metabolic in nature, bounded by the components and relationships
                                       of the systems themselves [<a href="#R32">32</a>]. Critically, different provisioning systems, exhibiting different metabolic characteristics,
                                       can meet the same needs with different energy and material throughput, as evidenced
                                       by the distinctions between public transit and individual car ownership for meeting
                                       transportation needs [<a href="#R16">16</a>].

                                    <p id="d1e271">The Canadian federal government, like many governments, has a sustainable development
                                       strategy that outlines policy goals for environmental and social outcomes, and has
                                       stated that all Canadians should ‘‘live in clean, sustainable communities that contribute
                                       to their health and well-being’’ [<a href="#R33">33</a>]. EE research out of the Living Well Within Limits project has established that there

                                       conditions in which the provisioning systems remain unchanged. The carbon intensity
                                       of a given provisioning system is not inherent. Recent research by Steinberger et

                                    <p id="d1e294">Understanding housing as a part of a provisioning system for well-being begins with
                                       land as a foundation, both in abstract terms as well as grounding housing in the biosphere
                                       and all the planetary and ecological processes of a given place. The physical structure
                                       of a home is built from materials from the biosphere like wood, stone, metal, or resource-derived
                                       products (like drywall or rock wool) processed using resources and labor. The distance
                                       that materials can travel to build and maintain a home depend on infrastructure like
                                       roads and seaports, mediated by communication and other technologies. Institutions
                                       facilitate and delineate how these processes are organized through rules and regulations
                                       at varying scales including building codes, trade governance, funding pathways, interest
                                       rates, and labor laws. Housing is also subject to local and community social norms
                                       and practices, and ideologies of justice and distribution. Housing is considered a
                                       fundamental ‘need satisfier’ for the purpose of well-being. Right now, provisioning
                                       systems for housing are intimately tied to real estate markets, debt-money creation,
                                       financialization through the creation of commodity forms such as mortgage backed securities,
                                       land enclosures and land legally defined as private property, and international material
                                       supply chains subject to financialization.

                                       process, during which investments in housing correlated with economic growth overall
                                       [<a href="#R35">35</a>]. Capital formation is generally understood to be additions to ‘fixed assets’ or

                                       well-being of the labor force and worthwhile for the further consumption and demand
                                       it represented. New houses needed to be furnished and maintained; they were sites
                                       of increasing throughput which would reflect well in national accounts like GDP. In
                                       the increasingly financially deregulated international and domestic landscape that
                                       characterizes the last forty years, however, understanding capital formation as contributing
                                       to a ‘real economy’ became blurred as mainstream understandings of what produces value,
                                       and is thus understood as an asset, became sublimated under a form of value monism
                                       that treated all profit as value creation [<a href="#R36">36</a>]. Capital formation then came to be measured by merely assessing national changes
                                       in net savings, and any form of return on investment became an investment in capital
                                       formation [<a href="#R37">37</a>]. As Schneider and Nelson [<a href="#R6">6</a>] note in their book, Housing for Degrowth, housing has long been an important sector
                                       of the economy as a site of economic growth, and growth itself considered a solution
                                       to affordability issues and housing shortages.

                                    <p id="d1e313">Real estate is part of the acronym FIRE (Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate), which
                                       distinguishes public equity market investments in a post-industrial service economy
                                       as opposed to manufacturing sector sources of value creation [<a href="#R38">38</a>]. Housing is a critical site for current debt-money creation through the issuing
                                       of mortgages. In 1950, more than half of owner-occupied homes in North America were
                                       debt-free [<a href="#R35">35</a>], but recent trends in Canada show that this is no longer the case, with 43% of owner-occupied
                                       homes free from initial mortgage debt [<a href="#R39">39</a>], though often still carrying home equity lines of credit (HELC), all of which contributes
                                       to total mortgage and HELC debt in Canada reaching $2 trillion in 2021 [<a href="#R40">40</a>]. Banks issue 75% of mortgages in Canada and then issue 74% of the mortgage-backed
                                       securities as financial products [<a href="#R41">41</a>]. Much of the remaining proportion is part of the private investment funds increasingly
                                       interested in rental properties as long term asset management in uncertain financial
                                       climates [<a href="#R42">42</a>]. The bank-issued debt upon which rests further commodity forms of speculative securities
                                       is the predominant form of homeownership for Canadians (and Americans, it must also
                                       be said), and ties housing to a provisioning system with a financial growth imperative.
                                       In the context of the Global Ecological Crisis, this economic growth imperative has
                                       ecological consequences that are significant due to the current lack of meaningful
                                       decoupling of GDP growth rates from carbon emissions growth rates [<a href="#R43">43</a>].

                                       refers to the combination of visible and invisible homelessness, housing costing more
                                       than 30% of one’s income, having too many people in a home, housing in need of significant
                                       repair, or what is termed ‘unfit housing’. It may be more broadly phrased as a state

                                    <p id="d1e345">In Canada, homelessness has been on the rise between 2010-2017 [<a href="#R44">44</a>], with 1% of the total population visibly homeless, that is, sleeping rough or using
                                       shelters, and 8% of the population experiencing ‘hidden’ homelessness such as sleeping
                                       in their car, with friends, ‘couch surfing’, or in a tent [<a href="#R45">45</a>]. Canada also has the highest income to house price ratio in the world [<a href="#R46">46</a>], which means that the average price of a house costs more for Canadians relative
                                       to income than anyone else in the world. This might explain Canada’s household debt
                                       to income ratio at currently more than 170%, and vacancy rates for rental properties

                                    <p id="d1e365">North Hastings is the northern part of Hastings County in Ontario, Canada. This land
                                       is the home of the Kijicho Manito Madouskarini Algonquin First Nation, and the land
                                       falls under Gdoo-naaganinaa, also known as the Dish with One Spoon Treaty, a commons
                                       management treaty between the Nishnaabeg and Haudenosaunee [<a href="#R48">48</a>]. The territory remains unceded as of 2021, though negotiations to resolve land relations
                                       with the Canadian federal government are ongoing. Post-colonization, the primary local
                                       economy has been extraction of minerals and timber, though today this occurs in lesser
                                       amounts relative to the growing service and tourism industry [<a href="#R49">49</a>]. North Hastings is considered a ‘more affordable’ cottage country compared to areas
                                       closer to metropolitan centres such as Toronto, Ottawa, or Montreal, though this too
                                       is changing.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e373">House price inflation during the pandemic has been widespread across Canada (and beyond),
                                       but the highest increases have been felt in rural areas like North Hastings, which
                                       experienced a 31% increase from February 2020 to February 2021 alone [<a href="#R50">50</a>], and recent real estate reports claim a three year price inflation of 78% from 2017
                                       to 2020 [<a href="#R51">51</a>].

                                       average rates of homelessness, both visible and hidden [<a href="#R52">52</a>]. Even within Hastings county, the peoples of North Hastings, as a predominantly
                                       rural and geographically isolated part of the county, experience disproportionately
                                       high levels of housing stress. While a housing report from 2019 shows that 1/6 of
                                       county households have insufficient housing [<a href="#R53">53</a>], this percentage is thought to be higher in North Hastings because of higher average
                                       rents combined with lower than average incomes; as of the 2016 census, the average
                                       median income of North Hastings was below the provincial poverty line [<a href="#R54">54</a>]. Homelessness in Bancroft (the primary city in North Hastings) is estimated to be
                                       almost 2% of the population [<a href="#R55">55</a>], disproportionately affecting indigenous people who account for 50% of homeless
                                       people, while constituting only 32% of the population [<a href="#R54">54</a>, <a href="#R56">56</a>].

                                       of anti-poverty work, the core importance of housing to addressing poverty through
                                       the ‘housing first’ approach recognizes that housing is a non-negotiable aspect of
                                       well-being and satisfaction of needs, and any work to increase well-being must address

                                    <p id="d1e410">Anti-poverty mandates often come into conflict with traditional funding pathways that
                                       situate the non-profit sector primarily as addressing market failures in the form
                                       of distributional social problems. Much public and increasingly private funding is
                                       organized around the problem framing of market failure [<a href="#R57">57</a>], ie: that the lack of affordable housing is due to failures of the market to allocate
                                       housing efficiently, and thus the solution is to invest in practices that merely correct
                                       the market fault without affecting the market itself. Many organizations, NHCT included,
                                       have turned towards community land and housing trusts as a non-market solution to
                                       meet well-being needs as well as imagine truly sustainable futures. However, NHCT
                                       as an organization is interested in CLTs that are explicitly not imagined as a ‘bridge’
                                       to the housing market, but instead are a form of world building towards a more just
                                       and sustainable future. Following in the footsteps of attempts to imagine other worlds
                                       through CLTs, the clarity of NHCT’s goals align with the ‘transformative vs affirmative’
                                       framework used by Defilippis et al [<a href="#R58">58</a>], based on the work of Nancy Fraser [<a href="#R58">58</a>]. This distinction is between responses to injustice which transform systems to no
                                       longer produce injustice vs affirm and reproduce these systems, and thus continue
                                       to reproduce the same injustices.

                                    <p id="d1e427">All scales of government in Canada are tasked with prioritizing increases in affordable
                                       housing as the solution to the housing crisis, and most official policy plans include
                                       language around this. Numerous NGOs, charities, non-profits, and private development
                                       organizations are also trying to create more affordable housing. Most solutions that
                                       include public funding treat the lack of affordable housing as a market failure, and
                                       target other aspects of the provisioning system such as zoning, funding pathways and
                                       risk management, as a means to make the housing market function more efficiently [<a href="#R59">59</a>, <a href="#R60">60</a>]. In Canada, despite ‘affordable’ housing being defined as representing less than
                                       30% of monthly income expenditure [<a href="#R60">60</a>], public funding or zoning reforms which, instead of being tied to needs through
                                       previous ‘rent-geared-to-income’ support, have been replaced by reframing ‘affordable’
                                       as a percentage of market rent, which tracks with markets instead of needs. This might
                                       be understood as a commodification of non-market housing as new markets are institutionally
                                       defined for those who can’t participate in the larger market.

                                       of governance, from the direct provisioning of housing to allocating funds to fund
                                       private or non-profit housing development [<a href="#R4">4</a>]. This has been identified as part of the broader neoliberal governance regimes which
                                       shift service delivery strategies from the public domain to privatized or public-private
                                       partnerships [<a href="#R61">61</a>, <a href="#R62">62</a>]. This has led to less new affordable housing being built [<a href="#R4">4</a>].

                                    <p id="d1e452">Charity, public grants, and private-public partnerships produce housing that is still
                                       part of a capital formation process, as they usually are required to service long-term
                                       debt for either social or private investors, and are often part of ‘progressive’ zoning
                                       reforms that uses profits from market rate rentals to subsidize the offering of lower-rate

                                    <p id="d1e460">Alternative, less widespread, approaches attempt to use financial markets and direct
                                       financial capital towards social ends. They acknowledge housing market failure but
                                       instead of merely correcting for the failure (lack of affordable housing), they re-situate
                                       funding as the novel approach to capital formation in the housing market. This happens
                                       not through bank financing and thus bank-managed risk, but through municipal bonds,
                                       social bonds, or community investment bonds, through which risk is managed either
                                       through private cooperative or social investment funds [<a href="#R64">64</a>], public banks [<a href="#R65">65</a>], or municipal governments [<a href="#R66">66</a>]. In many of these cases, an investment opportunity is offered to private investors
                                       with varying rates of return, often named things like ‘profit with purpose’ or ‘social
                                       impact investing’.

                                    <p id="d1e471">The general vision in these alternative approaches is to direct capital to do good
                                       deeds while it is busy accumulating. This assumes we can attempt to align investment,
                                       and thus production, activities with the logic of capital accumulation, and tie our
                                       purposes to that of capital. However, in most of these cases, we have not redirected
                                       capital to social ends as much as we have redirected our social goals towards the
                                       accumulation of capital.

                                    <p id="d1e473">The housing provided through these mechanisms may itself be non-market, but the other
                                       parts of the provisioning system such as the institutions, funding bodies, and administrative
                                       norms that are part of the provisioning system are still dominated by market logics
                                       of capital formation, debt servicing, and competing with other all-purpose capital
                                       for investment. It must be said that these projects still produce housing and this
                                       is important and required. This analysis is meant to merely clarify that these solutions
                                       do not transform provisioning systems. Organizations interested in transforming provisioning
                                       systems will need to look beyond most solutions currently practiced today that treat
                                       housing principally as a site of capital formation instead of as a needs-satisfier
                                       for well-being.

                                    <p id="d1e478">Land trusts are legal structures which remove land from the real estate market in
                                       perpetuity. Land trusts define the relationship of humans to land and other humans,
                                       distinct from private property, which is an agreement of rights between humans about
                                       land or objects. Land trusts are often pursued for conservation purposes and are not
                                       always part of a process of ‘commoning’, or bringing land back into relationships
                                       of community governance. However, many land trusts become part of Community Land Trusts
                                       (CLTs) or housing trusts, which is considered to be more of a ‘commoning’ of land
                                       and part of a transformative approach to housing solutions [<a href="#R58">58</a>]. A housing trust tied to a land trust removes land from real estate markets and
                                       redefines relationships of the people to the land through responsibilities to the
                                       community and to the future.

                                    <p id="d1e483">A housing trust is a specific form of home ownership within a land trust in which
                                       you don’t own the land upon which your house rests, but the ownership of the house
                                       can be transferred with prescribed limits to financial gains. Houses are typically
                                       owner-occupied and cannot be a site of profit seeking such as renting, though other
                                       forms such as individual co-ops or cooperative property management organizations are
                                       also possible [<a href="#R67">67</a>]. Community land trusts are considered a non-market ‘third sector’ of affordable
                                       housing, as opposed to government-produced or private for-profit affordable housing
                                       developments [<a href="#R68">68</a>]. CLTs have been part of permanent solutions to affordable housing since the mid
                                       1980s in Canada, though they have their roots in civil rights movements in the USA.
                                       In Canada, they are almost exclusively urban, though in the USA there are a variety
                                       of rural, urban, and semi-urban CLTs.

                                    <p id="d1e491">CLTs, which have goals of permanent affordability, attempt to hold onto the value
                                       of subsidies and grants through agreements with homeowners that limit equity gain
                                       on house sales, but most of the financing of the corresponding mortgages still comes
                                       through traditional pathways of private bank debt-money creation [<a href="#R68">68</a>], which is part of larger securities trading and speculation. So while CLTs have
                                       removed land from markets, the housing on those lands remains substantially financialized.

                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e516">Markets are part of many provisioning systems for human needs and wants, as institutionally
                                       bounded spaces, both physical and conceptual/legal, for buying and selling goods and
                                       services with money. Markets are not unique to capitalism, but it is the scale of
                                       markets under financialized capitalism as the primary allocative regime that is under
                                       discussion here. Classical Economics makes distinctions between types of goods and
                                       services that are excludable, non-excludable, rivalrous and non-rivalrous. The parts
                                       of our world that are both excludable and rivalrous are considered by mainstream economists
                                       to be most efficiently allocated through market mechanisms in which we treat these
                                       goods as commodities in order to compare relative value through a single metric of
                                       price. However, for markets to function ‘efficiently’, the price must reflect supply
                                       and demand, with prices for goods or services by class; all corn is the same, all
                                       bitumen is the same, all coffee is the same. All the processes and social and ecological
                                       contexts that are part of production disappear as the good enters the market and becomes
                                       a commodity, immediately assumed to be an average within the class [<a href="#R71">71</a>]. Aside from averageness, commodities have in common that they are all produced for
                                       exchange, and for profit. In order for a price to be set by supply and demand functions,
                                       these commodities have to be produced with supply and demand and price in mind. Yet,
                                       Polanyi [<a href="#R73">73</a>] points out, labour, land, and money are not ‘produced’ to be sold in markets, so
                                       any commodification and market pricing of these factors of production conceals the
                                       true origin of their value.
                                       
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e524">The parts of the world that are shared, that are embedded in ecological relations
                                       that do not adhere to a clear distinction of rivalrous/non-rivalrous; that these goods
                                       and services should be allocated by markets does not fulfill even mainstream logic.
                                       This includes land and housing. While land has long been understood as a false commodity
                                       [<a href="#R73">73</a>], housing, on the other hand, is indeed sometimes produced as a commodity to be sold
                                       in the real estate market (as opposed to owner-builds). And yet, housing has a demonstrated
                                       history as a badly behaved commodity. Even within mainstream economics which treats
                                       both land and housing as commodities, there has been much note of how poorly real
                                       estate markets adhere to market logic. For instance, though part of the housing crisis
                                       in the USA and Canada has been attributed to absolute and relative scarcity of housing,
                                       there is an acknowledgement that when new housing is added to markets, prices do not
                                       drop as one might expect [<a href="#R46">46</a>]. Even in the 1950s it was already established that demand for housing corresponds
                                       to fluctuations in income much more than it reacts to price changes in housing markets
                                       [<a href="#R35">35</a>]. If demand, price, and supply have weak, if any, relationship, we might be forgiven
                                       for surmising that markets are not allocating as expected, and market theory is not
                                       performing as desired.

                                       human liberty is best expressed as the freedom to respond to price signals. And yet,
                                       Brown [<a href="#R57">57</a>] put it succinctly that under these market conditions, ‘‘the value of someone’s well-being
                                       is determined by their ability to pay existing prices: no wealth/income, no share.’’
                                       When well-being is dependent on shelter, and on other needs satisfiers as determined
                                       by Doyal and Gough [<a href="#R16">16</a>], or Max-Neef [<a href="#R75">75</a>], there can be no ‘freedom’ to respond to price signals, one cannot choose to not
                                       have housing as an expression of ‘preference’. Consent is often defined as the ability
                                       to say no, and an ‘offer you can’t refuse’ is usually called coercion. In order to
                                       meet one’s needs through engagement in a market, to express ‘preference’, there can
                                       be no consent when it comes to essential needs satisfiers like water, food, housing,
                                       safety, and health care. Which might suggest that markets shouldn’t be the primary
                                       form of provisioning these essential needs-satisfiers.

                                    <p id="d1e555">The incommensurability of values recognized as critical to the well being of all life
                                       on earth is troubled by the existence of institutionalized fully commensurable financial
                                       capital and what Hornborg [<a href="#R76">76</a>] calls all-purpose money. He explains that this single form of valuation via money
                                       conceals the unequal distribution, relations, and constitution of values within exchanges,
                                       much of which takes place in markets. Susan Strange [<a href="#R77">77</a>] suggests that in market based economies that use prices to guide production choices
                                       as a form of governance and pathway to capital accumulation, the monetary structure
                                       itself, as it provisions credit, becomes of prominent importance. This echoes the
                                       work of Svartzman et al [<a href="#R78">78</a>] in endorsing an EE understanding of money as endogenous to the economy, creating
                                       both the means and the language of full commensurability of value. Taking this into
                                       consideration, money and credit becomes an integral part of provisioning systems themselves
                                       and, proposals within EE that call for sovereign money [<a href="#R79">79</a>], local currencies [<a href="#R80">80</a>], ecological currencies [<a href="#R76">76</a>], can and should be situated within the provisioning systems of our economy in order
                                       to better contextualize the impacts beyond theory and how these might contribute to
                                       transformations of provisioning systems themselves.

                                       not need to be a driver of growth, a consideration that has received much treatment
                                       in EE and EMT theorizing [<a href="#R81">81</a>, <a href="#R82">82</a>, <a href="#R83">83</a>] as well as in more mainstream economic circles [<a href="#R84">84</a>]. However, as Ament [<a href="#R83">83</a>] notes as part of an ecological theory of money, <i>all</i> money is a claim to resources. Situating debt-money creation within provisioning
                                       systems ties debt-money creation to resource use, production processes, markets, and
                                       regulatory institutions which determine parameters for the creation of money and to
                                       what end it is directed. The logically sound Keynesian monetarist theory which lays
                                       the groundwork for making a claim that debt-money creation does not create growth,
                                       cannot be said to adhere to the parameters of financialized global markets and the
                                       almost exclusive regulatory commitment to debt-money creation under a regime of fully
                                       commensurable values for the purpose of capital formation undifferentiated between

                                       we accept the critique of mainstream solutions to housing crises as not addressing
                                       the causes of housing crises because of how they reproduce market logics elsewhere

                                    <p id="d1e605">Capital sequestration is about taking current financial capital in the form of all
                                       purpose money that has been part of cycles of accumulation based on full commensurability
                                       of values, and disaggregating this financial capital in a permanent and semi-permanent
                                       manner into social and ecological values. How to do this requires formal and semi-formal
                                       institutions to manage the boundaries of these values, for the purpose of shifting
                                       provisioning systems for housing to provision housing resources not through markets
                                       but through alternative governance bodies.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e607">Capital sequestration is then a combination of taking already existing money, using
                                       it to invest in land trusts, which immediately moves land outside of markets, and
                                       housing trusts to move housing outside of markets. This movement from market to non-market
                                       provisioning disaggregates all purpose money into permanent forms of so-called critical
                                       natural capital [<a href="#R17">17</a>] that remains outside of single-value market valuation, into long term well-being
                                       through housing, and into community forms of money through the terms of capital controls
                                       in housing and investment products.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e612">Calling this capital sequestration is to be explicit about its ecological purposes.
                                       Not all removal of assets from markets is a form of decommodification, if they remain
                                       a site for the creation of new commodity forms such as mortgage backed securities,
                                       or if they are still tied to other aspects of the provisioning systems that are market-grounded.
                                       The implied connection with carbon sequestration is intentional, to stimulate a connection
                                       to building an economy that is recognized to be inherently ecologically embedded.
                                       Though there isn’t a direct claim that can be made yet about the ecological impact
                                       in an absolute or macro sense about the practice of initial small scale choices like
                                       moving land into a trust, it indicates that it is part of a larger world building
                                       project directly implicating financialized markets as they are situated and structured
                                       within provisioning systems today as core drivers of ecological <i>un</i>sustainability. Capital sequestration removes financial capital from markets, while
                                       retaining the capacity for social and ecological flows of value for the purpose of
                                       satisfaction of essential needs. Provisioning systems being metabolic in nature [<a href="#R30">30</a>], one might hypothesize that community-led transformation of the provisioning systems
                                       for housing could have significant and desirable ecological impact.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e620">It can be called sequestration, as opposed to destruction or depreciation, because
                                       the land and housing is still an asset, albeit not on the record books of single-valuation
                                       financial institutions, and still provides a flow of value towards creating well-being,
                                       in the form of providing place and relationship to ecologies through shelter. Much
                                       treatment in EE literature has been given to the theoretical idea that ‘‘growth’’
                                       might not violate planetary boundaries as long as it was growth of well-being, or
                                       ecological resilience, and the EE push for alternative metrics to GDP reflects this
                                       [<a href="#R85">85</a>, <a href="#R86">86</a>]. The neoliberal capture of the discourse around decoupling and green growth has
                                       diminished some of the excitement about advocating for forms of growth other than
                                       financial, and for good reason, because so many aspects of provisioning systems have
                                       either experienced market capture or fall under market logic and exclusively financial
                                       valuation. The concept of growth in well-being or ecological resilience being distinct
                                       from financially quantified economic growth requires transformations of provisioning
                                       systems as well as the creation and empowerment of new institutions to manage the
                                       boundaries of incommensurable values.

                                    <p id="d1e631">A paradox of degrowth has been how to invest in a transformation, producing intentionally
                                       less returns to financial capital (in aggregate), while also competing with single-metric
                                       valuations of financial capital for investors. The purpose of investing is usually
                                       capital formation, to create increased or new flows of income in monetary form. So
                                       investing in/as capital <i>sequestration</i> is a method of creating new stocks of incommensurable non-market value, from which
                                       flows goods and services such as housing, and as a process of shifting our human relationship
                                       to land from that of (false) commodity as private property and real estate to interconnected

                                    <p id="d1e636">Investment matters, and what we do with money matters- capital sequestration is neither
                                       capital destruction in the form of consumption spending, nor capital formation. Investment
                                       is a form of world building, and where capital is directed matters because of the
                                       way it reinforces and structures provisioning systems and processes of production.

                                    <p id="d1e638">Some social change discussions hinge around grass roots or from-below transformations
                                       that originate in the activism and labour of peoples marginalized from hierarchies
                                       of power [<a href="#R87">87</a>]; in this context, capital sequestration can be considered a middle pathway of investing-from-below.
                                       It is ‘from-below’ because it bypasses current dominant institutional forms of capital
                                       management, and it is a middle path because it leverages privately held capital to
                                       make changes to provisioning systems. This privately held financial capital yields
                                       a power that cannot be said to come from the margins or from below. Capital sequestration,
                                       then, as an investment in transformation, can be viewed also as the practice of forging
                                       a counter-hegemonic historical bloc in the tradition of Gramsci [<a href="#R88">88</a>], as well as part of a process of resituating power in civil society institutions

                                    <p id="d1e652">The process of valuation is itself a form of world building, and as the late David
                                       Graeber has said, ‘‘it is value, then, that brings universes into being’’ [<a href="#R90">90</a>]. Recognizing incommensurable values, as EE advocates for, and creating value articulating
                                       institutions then becomes a pathway for transformation, for world building. The term
                                       ‘world building’ is used here as a way to think about social reproduction, about affective
                                       labor, about what we put our effort towards, what we invest in, and what we value.
                                       This ties to the work of many heterodox economists [<a href="#R91">91</a>, <a href="#R92">92</a>, <a href="#R93">93</a>], theorists [<a href="#R90">90</a>, <a href="#R94">94</a>], and philosophers [<a href="#R95">95</a>, <a href="#R96">96</a>, <a href="#R97">97</a>] to describe the power and agency of directing resources towards a desired end, while
                                       also avoiding the abstruse use of terms like social reproduction outside of theory
                                       discussions. World building does not exactly reflect the full complexity all of these
                                       terms, but it connects with all of them in ways that are meaningful, and ties into
                                       emerging onto-epistemological discussions happening in the realm of social ecological
                                       economics [<a href="#R11">11</a>, <a href="#R98">98</a>]. It should be mentioned that world-building is also terminology used in fiction
                                       writing to describe the ontology or construction of a creative landscape for the purpose
                                       of narrative, which seems less like a conflict than a complement to the literal, material,
                                       and social construction of the shared experience of reality I use the term to describe.

                                    <p id="d1e691">There is much discussion of how critical ‘value-articulating institutions’ are to
                                       governance in a degrowth or post growth context. It might be easy to take one of the
                                       fundamental assertions of EE, that within our shared world exist incommensurable values,
                                       and say then that some or indeed all of these institutions of degrowth/post growth
                                       must be able to articulate and thus govern the incommensurability of these values
                                       as a core EE mandate focused on allocation, scale, and distribution. Because as political
                                       economist Rodrik says, ‘‘institutional arrangements are the rules that determine the
                                       allocation of rights to a society’s resources’’ [<a href="#R99">99</a>]. But what might this look like? The extensive work by Ostrom [<a href="#R100">100</a>] into place-based, ecologically and culturally situated institutional governance
                                       forms, as well as analysis of institutions by Vatn [<a href="#R101">101</a>] and Veblen [<a href="#R102">102</a>] are all parts of EE considerations of post growth, degrowth, and postcapitalist
                                       institutions, and the ‘boundary commoning’ work of De Angelis [<a href="#R103">103</a>] is particularly relevant to imagining institutions for the purpose of governing
                                       the boundary between market/non-market and financial valuation/plural values.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e708">To a certain extent, the disaggregating of capital into social and ecological value
                                       through land and housing trusts is the easy part, it is the keeping it disaggregated,
                                       thereby sequestered, that is the challenge. This is a role of institutions of degrowth:
                                       to manage the boundary of market and non-market, of incommensurable values. CLTs use
                                       language around ‘permanent affordability’ to hold the financial value of subsidies
                                       within housing trusts through the use of equity limits. This means that when a homeowner
                                       wants to transfer title to their housing (but not the land, which is held in trust),
                                       most of any increase in the sale price compared to the original purchase price is
                                       returned to the housing trust organization for the purpose of maintaining affordability
                                       and not to the owner (though there are exceptions for improvements and maintenance
                                       to the home). So while CLTs have removed land from markets, the housing on those lands
                                       remains substantially financialized, as most of the financing of the corresponding
                                       mortgages in CLTs still comes through traditional pathways of private bank debt-money
                                       creation [<a href="#R68">68</a>], which is part of larger securities trading and speculation. As the institutional
                                       forms already exist to manage the boundary of land in the legal entity of a land trust,
                                       and the structures developed by CLTs such as equity limitations placed on housing,
                                       along with rights of refusal and other clauses written into contracts, serve as already-existing
                                       boundary management forms, it is the funding practices, then, that remain to be coordinated
                                       with these institutional forms to frame investment as world building, as sequestering
                                       capital.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e713">This can be done as an institution such as a community investment fund issuing social
                                       or community investment bonds, with either municipal, public, or collective private
                                       management of risk. The risk is managed in the fund itself if the scale of financing
                                       is large enough, with anywhere from 10-200 million being suggested as the starting
                                       scale for community investment funds wishing to hold the trust of investors enough
                                       to warrant the risk of holding capital [<a href="#R64">64</a>]. For discussion purposes, I will be calling this a Capital Sequestration Fund (CSF).
                                       Alternatively, the risk could be managed through the issuing of low- or no-interest
                                       loans or mortgages through public banks in relationship with the CLT, without a CSF,
                                       agreements with government to underwrite certain phases of bond issuance as is done
                                       in Ontario with green investing [<a href="#R104">104</a>] or the municipal management and issuance of low or no interest loans, as is done
                                       for some UK green investment projects [<a href="#R66">66</a>] and could also be done for CLT housing projects.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e724">In a CSF, long or short term bonds, which are a financial product offered to investors,
                                       can be used to create a fund capable of then issuing mortgages for individual homeownership
                                       within the CLT, and/or can be used to fund what might be called a degrowth development
                                       initiative that builds and/or manages housing as rental properties, cooperatives,
                                       or co-housing. How this differs from existing non-profits already in the affordable
                                       housing sector is in the by-laws of the organization itself- as many non-profits and
                                       CLTs frame themselves as addressing market failures and attempting to create a bridge
                                       to the larger market for low-income people [<a href="#R68">68</a>]. The by-laws for a non-market property management or development organization situated
                                       within a provisioning system largely structured by financial markets must be explicit
                                       in long term market-boundary governance goals not only for the organization itself
                                       but for the provisioning system it is a part of, as well as articulating what they
                                       are protecting from markets, why, and for how long. There are likely some organizations
                                       that indeed fulfill this role in practice already, and these should be identified
                                       as potentially part of a capital sequestering and degrowth world-building process.

                                    <p id="d1e732">Capital controls are normally discussed in terms of cross-border trade and global
                                       markets. However, if we consider the boundary of market and non-market as a site of
                                       governance, then community capital controls becomes a framing that is not only meaningful,
                                       but potentially resolves some of the tensions around community currencies debated
                                       in EE and in degrowth [<a href="#R6">6</a>, <a href="#R80">80</a>]. Using ecological macroeconomic understandings of incommensurable capitals, capital
                                       controls at varying scales must become a community governance issue, and community
                                       capital controls becomes a method of managing decommodification as a part of degrowth.

                                       this CSF financing housing, becomes a form of capital control. Capital sequestration
                                       treats currently existing financial resources people have as community money without
                                       needing a community currency. The use of this money and direction of this money need
                                       not be mediated by the market logics of private banks which seek a return in compensation

                                       an inherent and thus infinite requirement for capital management in an ecological
                                       economy. Capital sequestration may actually be a necessary part of degrowth, through
                                       scaling down the financialized capital and sequestering it into other values. Theoretically,
                                       after a degrowth transition, this idea and practice of capital sequestration doesn’t
                                       need to exist. This is not because in a post growth economy that financialized capital
                                       never needs transforming, because value takes many value forms as it moves through
                                       provisioning systems, but that instead of being capital sequestration ad infinitum,
                                       it becomes a form of capital management, or capital governance with post growth institutions.
                                       In a post growth economy, in which multi-criteria valuation and a plurality of metrics
                                       stand in as shared goals instead of mere GDP, the concept of capital sequestration
                                       need not be relevant any longer.

                                       provisioning systems would likely not be without some perceived risks and frustrations.
                                       Even today, when homeowners move from CLTs with associated equity limits to open market
                                       housing which is priced according to growth norms, CLTs appear to offer less financial

                                       homes and land as retirement security. While this is a legitimate concern in the present

                                       systems, whether or not a home represents a secure retirement investment will be the

                                    <p id="d1e755">As said by Schneider and Nelson, editors of a critical book on Housing and Degrowth
                                       [<a href="#R6">6</a>], ‘‘The degrowth housing narrative must illustrate that another world is possible,
                                       that a realistic pathway exists for transformation- a strong, coherent, realist narrative
                                       where bottom-up and top-down action and interdisciplinary perspectives can inspire
                                       such a holistic movement.’’ Degrowth scholars and housing advocates alike regularly
                                       assert the need for treating housing as a human right, without explicitly stating
                                       that to define something as a human right is a discursive method of managing a market
                                       and non-market boundary. Schneider &amp; Nelson [<a href="#R6">6</a>] and Mete [<a href="#R5">5</a>] have all pointed out the ways in which financing, re-thinking property rights and
                                       participation, and inclusivity of degrowth or post growth housing are critical to
                                       and underdeveloped in the degrowth/post growth literature. Capital Sequestration is
                                       put forth here as a proposal to contribute to a conversation about what the financing
                                       of an alternative and non-market housing provisioning system might look like, how
                                       to engage with property in the form of land and housing trusts, and how the initiatives
                                       of organizations like North Hastings Community Trust can be supported by and support
                                       this transformative world building.

                              <p id="d1e769">Capital sequestration is an idea that brings together many principles, ideas, and
                                 theory work within EE to assist organizations like North Hastings Community Trust
                                 in participating in community-led transformations of provisioning systems. By taking
                                 a provisioning system approach to housing, it is possible to collectively disaggregate
                                 financial value into ecological and social values through the combined use of legal
                                 and institutional structures of land and housing trusts and novel approaches to funding.
                                 This effectively sequesters financial capital for common benefit of common resources
                                 and creates a community form of capital control. Much has yet to be explored within
                                 this concept, but capital sequestration holds much promise for imagining how to invest
                                 in degrowth, and assist local anti-poverty and affordable housing initiatives to apply
                                 EE theories towards meaningful world building.
