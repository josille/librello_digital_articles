                              have re- confirmed the relevance of sustainability as the guiding paradigm in countering
                              the development and climate crisis of the Anthropocene. Recent decades however, have
                              been characterized by confusion, contestations, and arbitrariness in defining the
                              nature and pathways of sustainable development. Humanity must urgently find ways to
                              unlock the potential of the sustainability paradigm and organize a sustainability
                              transforma- tion. An emerging sustainability science community has already established
                              considerable consensus on essential features of transformative science and research.
                              Sustainability scholars are providing growing evidence that an emancipatory and democratic
                              construction of sustainable development and more equitable, deliberative, and democratized
                              knowledge generation are pivotal in tackling sustainability challenges. These findings
                              are further underpinned by experiences gained in the Eastern and Southern Africa Partnership
                              Programme (1999–2015)—a rare case of a long-term, transnational, and transdisciplinary
                              research en- deavour already completed. The programme fulfilled the dual role which
                              is compulsory in transformative research: It generated contextualized knowledge and
                              innovation at the science–society interface while simultaneously securing meaningful
                              participation and Southern agency in a co-evolutionary process. This paper offers
                              insight into the programme’s adaptive structure and implementation processes, which
                              fostered deliberation, capacity development, and joint programme navigation benchmarked
                              against local needs and broader sustainability demands. The ESAPP experience confirms
                              that, if taken as the overarching frame of reference for all actors involved, the
                              sustainability paradigm unfolds its integrative and transformative power. It enables
                              sustainability-oriented actors from all scientific and practical fields to seek consilience
                              between differing development and innovation paradigms and synchronize their development
                              agendas and research frameworks on behalf of societal co-production of knowledge and
                              innovation. Accordingly, the sustainability paradigm has the power to guide development
                              and innovation policy, and practice out of the current confusion and ineffectiveness.</span></div>

                                    <p id="d1e88">At the 2015 United Nations Sustainable Development Summit in New York, world leaders
                                       responded to alarming scientific evidence showing that we humans are interfering with
                                       the Earth system at a scale and magnitude that threatens our own survival. With the
                                       adoption of the <i>2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals</i> (SDGs), they reconfirmed the primacy of sustainability as the guiding development
                                       paradigm (UN, 2015). Framed in the so-called “Brundtland Report” [<a href="#R01">1</a>] and endorsed at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio, the sustainability paradigm is not
                                       novel; and looking back, it has fallen short of expectations in various ways. Nevertheless
                                       it continues to be the official global response to the development and climate crisis
                                       of the Anthropocene. But—and this is confirmed by the renewed global commitment—science
                                       and society must urgently find ways to unlock its potential and organize a sustainability
                                       transformation [<a href="#R02">2</a>].
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e99">The Post-Brundtland world is characterized by confusion, contestations, and arbitrariness
                                       in identifying the nature and pathways of sustainable development [<a href="#R03">3</a>, <a href="#R04">4</a>, <a href="#R05">5</a>]. The implications of the sustainability paradigm as an antithesis to the paradigm
                                       of growth and transfer are not easy to capture. Although our understanding of development
                                       intervention and global governance has fundamentally changed [<a href="#R06">6</a>, <a href="#R07">7</a>, <a href="#R08">8</a>], the normativity and the transformative power of sustainability have reached buzzword
                                       status [<a href="#R09">9</a>]. At the same time, unorthodox scholars across diverse fields in science, technology,
                                       and development, have observed narrow, exploitative, and often destructive use of
                                       promising post-Rio development concepts such as innovation [<a href="#R10">10</a>, <a href="#R11">11</a>], gender mainstreaming [<a href="#R12">12</a>], livelihoods [<a href="#R13">13</a>, <a href="#R14">14</a>], justice [<a href="#R15">15</a>], or transformation [<a href="#R16">16</a>], to mention just a few. Scholars argue that systemic thinking, equity-based science-society
                                       interaction, and reflexive learning – which are all indispensable in generating knowledge
                                       and innovation for sustainable development—continue to be marginalized, confined to
                                       single sectors, and used to serve vested interests [<a href="#R17">17</a>, <a href="#R18">18</a>, <a href="#R19">19</a>]. Despite progress on the integration of civil society in global environmental assessments
                                       and negotiations, power disparities and self-interest are hampering action and creating
                                       new tensions, disparities, and bargaining between the global North and South [<a href="#R20">20</a>, <a href="#R21">21</a>, <a href="#R22">22</a>, <a href="#R23">23</a>]. While economic bias gets much of the attention in the debate, sustainability scholars
                                       also criticize frequent environmental bias at the expense of human and social issues
                                       [<a href="#R04">4</a>], and social bias. The latter prevailed in the Millennium Development Goals, for
                                       example [<a href="#R24">24</a>]. Spangenberg ([<a href="#R18">18</a>] p. 277) points out a damaging “trend towards a further fragmentation of research
                                       concerning the substance of sustainability”. Skoglund and Jensen ([<a href="#R22">22</a>] p. 124) provide a striking example of how climate policy is misguided; they refer
                                       to Chandler (2012), who showed “how different policies and non-governmental organizations
                                       rely on the `adaptation agenda' to suggest survival strategies for the poor: thus
                                       attempting to align the marginalized with `vulnerability to climate change', instead
                                       of addressing the broader economic and social factors that gave rise to their marginalized
                                       position”. Such examples illustrate how concrete efforts and successes fade in an
                                       amalgam of overlapping and often contradictory approaches and discourses ranging from
                                       mainstream sustainability to green radicalism [<a href="#R25">25</a>], or from weak sustainability to more radical constructions of strong sustainability
                                       [<a href="#R04">4</a>, <a href="#R26">26</a>, <a href="#R27">27</a>]. As a consequence, the pre-Brundtland paradigm of growth, with its “loading-dock
                                       approach” [<a href="#R28">28</a>] of transferring scientific and technological solutions to decision-makers, is persisting
                                       [<a href="#R29">29</a>, <a href="#R30">30</a>]. To break its dominance and unlock transformative potentials, sustainability advocates
                                       have begun to reclaim the emancipatory power inherent in the original conceptualizations
                                       of development in their respective disciplines and practical domains. Taking systems
                                       approaches, they strive for epistemological and practical grounding as well as for
                                       further clarification of the interfaces between diverse development concepts (see,
                                       for example, [<a href="#R09">9</a>, <a href="#R10">10</a>, <a href="#R11">11</a>, <a href="#R19">19</a>, <a href="#R31">31</a>, <a href="#R32">32</a>, <a href="#R33">33</a>, <a href="#R34">34</a>]).

                                    <p id="d1e227">This leads to the approach I take in this paper. My overarching question is: How can
                                       science contribute to a sustainability transformation? More specifically, I reflect
                                       on various aspects that are essential in organizing transformative research. I argue
                                       that an emancipatory and democratic construction of sustainable development is pivotal
                                       in tackling sustainability challenges. An emerging sustainability science is providing
                                       growing evidence of this fact. I further underpin my argument with experiences gained
                                       in the <i>Eastern and Southern Africa Partnership Programme</i>—a rare case of a long-term transdisciplinary research endeavour already completed.
                                       With my contribution, I intend to confirm that, if taken as the principal frame of
                                       reference, sustainable development is suited to integrate the efforts of sustainability-oriented
                                       scholars and practitioners across different profiles. It provides orientation in synchronizing
                                       development agendas and frameworks towards societal co-production of knowledge and
                                       innovation. Accordingly, the sustainability paradigm has the power to guide development
                                       and innovation policy and practice out of the current confusion and ineffectiveness.

                                    <p id="d1e235">Fortunately, we can build on promising achievements in transformative research. A
                                       multitude of reviews and syntheses show how an emerging sustainability science community
                                       is establishing considerable consensus on the sustainability paradigm's epistemological
                                       and practical implications for science and research (see, for example, [<a href="#R08">8</a>, <a href="#R16">16</a>, <a href="#R18">18</a>, <a href="#R22">22</a>, <a href="#R27">27</a>, <a href="#R29">29</a>, <a href="#R35">35</a>]). With a view to promoting equity-based, just development within the planetary boundaries,
                                       scholars are working to identify enabling institutional contexts and developing transdisciplinary
                                       research frameworks and procedures across scientific disciplines and at the interfaces
                                       between science and society, as well as between science and policy [<a href="#R32">32</a>, <a href="#R36">36</a>, <a href="#R37">37</a>, <a href="#R38">38</a>, <a href="#R39">39</a>, <a href="#R40">40</a>]. They conceive of sustainability as a societal future forming process [<a href="#R05">5</a>], as it “emerges as a horizon to be approached but never reached” ([<a href="#R42">42</a>] p. 992). Accordingly, transdisciplinary theory and practice must accommodate pluralism
                                       and experimentation. But, as Waas and colleagues ([<a href="#R04">4</a>] p. 1645) point out, this future forming process has to be benchmarked against the
                                       “precise and unambiguous meaning” of the original conceptualization of sustainable
                                       development. They identify four fundamental principles—normativity, equity, integration,
                                       and dynamism—that “represent the interpretational limits of the concept and are essential
                                       to sustainability no matter which view and interpretation is employed” ([<a href="#R04">4</a>] p. 1657). Such (and analogous) principles respond to the complexity and adaptiveness
                                       of human–environment systems—which are the subject under consideration [<a href="#R33">33</a>, <a href="#R43">43</a>]—and provide orientation for societal future forming processes and “research in a
                                       world of flux” ([<a href="#R05">5</a>] p. 11). Ethical and equity concerns further underpin sustainable development as
                                       an emancipatory and transformative concept and open the floor for contesting existing
                                       power structures and decision-making processes [<a href="#R16">16</a>, <a href="#R26">26</a>, <a href="#R44">44</a>]. Not only natural resources but also social capital and knowledge must be distributed
                                       equally [<a href="#R23">23</a>, <a href="#R45">45</a>, <a href="#R46">46</a>, <a href="#R47">47</a>]. This requires us to rethink our understanding of knowledge and expertise, and to
                                       revise our traditional role and (self-)conception as researchers [<a href="#R41">41</a>, <a href="#R48">48</a>, <a href="#R49">49</a>]. Normative, democratic and procedural principles are at the core of transdisciplinary
                                       practice, in which scholars attempt to link science and civil society in joint reflexive
                                       or learning processes [<a href="#R17">17</a>, <a href="#R18">18</a>, <a href="#R26">26</a>, <a href="#R38">38</a>, <a href="#R40">40</a>]. Building on such critical reflection, sustainability scholars are bringing together
                                       long-standing participatory, democratic, and social movements' traditions and structuring
                                       research along new, deliberate forms of science–society interaction [<a href="#R51">51</a>, <a href="#R52">52</a>, <a href="#R53">53</a>, <a href="#R54">54</a>]. In a deliberative democracy, or indeed in any deliberative system, actors participate
                                       in a communicative process and influence collective decisions [<a href="#R25">25</a>, <a href="#R55">55</a>]. If we understand a research framework or programme as a deliberative system, its
                                       deliberative capacity—“the extent to which a political system possesses structures
                                       to host deliberation that is authentic, inclusive, and consequential” [<a href="#R51">51</a>]—gains utmost importance. But the deliberative capacity of individuals and institutions
                                       involved must likewise be secured for their equal and meaningful inclusion in future
                                       forming processes.  As well as putting equity and power issues to the fore, this undergirds
                                       the strategic goal framed by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
                                       Organization to develop knowledge societies by democratizing knowledge and knowledge
                                       generation [<a href="#R56">56</a>]. Indeed, progress in the democratization of knowledge has been observed [<a href="#R57">57</a>], and sustainability science is making headway. But transdisciplinarity is a relatively
                                       young field, and experiences of long-term transdisciplinary practice at a transnational,
                                       regional scale are particularly rare.

                                    <p id="d1e376">In the following, I will present the <i>Eastern and Southern Africa Partnership Programme</i> (ESAPP) as a research endeavour that is well-suited to help fill this gap. Running
                                       from 1999 to 2015, the programme brought together partners from Switzerland, Kenya,
                                       Ethiopia, Tanzania, Madagascar, Mozambique, and Eritrea in conducting long-term transdisciplinary
                                       research for sustainable land management and sustainable regional development. Two
                                       final publications provide substantial insights into this experience. Ehrensperger
                                       and colleagues present ESAPP's research and outcomes [<a href="#R58">58</a>], while Ott and Kiteme [<a href="#R59">59</a>] provide more in-depth reflections on the implementation, adaptation, and learning
                                       processes that took place within ESAPP. Taking up the arguments outlined above, I
                                       present programme features that proved to be supportive in strengthening deliberative
                                       capacity, equity-based knowledge generation, and institutional development for coherent
                                       local to global governance. I further discuss specific challenges that arose during
                                       the implementation of this transdisciplinary and transnational research programme
                                       as well as in securing its legacy.

                                    <p id="d1e393">When ESAPP was framed in the late 1990s, both public involvement and sustainability
                                       science were in their infancy. Ott and Kiteme [<a href="#R58">58</a>] show how three contextual developments at the interface between science and policymaking
                                       had prepared the ground for ESAPP's unique and innovative programme design: First,
                                       decades of research collaborations and networking between Switzerland and countries
                                       in Eastern Africa had established trust and fruitful interaction between scientists,
                                       funding organizations, as well as governmental and non-governmental actors and institutions
                                       of the countries involved. This led to the launching of an integrative research programme
                                       that matched the scientific and political landscape of Eastern Africa. Second, since
                                       1988, ESAPP's mother institution, the University of Bern's <i>Centre for Development and Environment </i>(CDE), had been mandated by the <i>Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation</i> (SDC) to help prepare Switzerland's position on the 1992 Rio conventions and translate
                                       them into poverty alleviation policy and practice. Already in the 1990s, CDE had come
                                       up with integrative, participatory concepts and tools designed to support human agency,
                                       science–society interaction, and social learning [<a href="#R59">59</a>]. Third, the programme designers could build on long-standing activities of a loose
                                       network of sustainability-oriented scholars and practitioners in Switzerland. In 1997,
                                       representatives from CDE and the Swiss Academy of Sciences and its <i>Commission for Research Partnerships with Developing Countries</i> (KFPE) drafted the KFPE's 11 Principles and 7 Questions as a guide for transdisciplinary
                                       and transnational research partnerships for sustainable development [<a href="#R44">44</a>, <a href="#R60">60</a>]. The KFPE guide is heavily equity-oriented and reflects state-of-the-art sustainability
                                       science even today. It underpins the choice of sustainable development, partnership,
                                       and transdisciplinarity as ESAPP's core foundations. The well-established collaboration
                                       between scientists, practitioners, and policymakers enabled SDC as the funding institution
                                       to give ESAPP's architects considerable leeway; at the same time, SDC was represented
                                       on ESAPP's advisory board—the programme's steering committee—from the outset. Such
                                       long-standing and trustful collaboration between researchers, funding organisations,
                                       and research users in the North and South, must be considered a precondition for transformative
                                       research [<a href="#R58">58</a>].

                                    </h3>
                                    <p id="d1e423">ESAPP was launched in 1999 with the mission of generating new knowledge and innovation
                                       for sustainable development on local to regional levels. The programme was aimed at
                                       mitigating sustainability challenges by making knowledge generation more democratic
                                       and accessible, increasing Southern ownership and agency, producing innovative research
                                       results, and promoting evidence-based, South-driven sustainable rural development.
                                       Transdisciplinarity as the second epistemological pillar of ESAPP was understood as
                                       an integrative approach that brings together scientific (disciplinary and interdisciplinary)
                                       and non-scientific (endogenous, indigenous, cultural, local, etc.) knowledge systems;
                                       academic, social, and political actors and institutions; and different places and
                                       scales [<a href="#R51">51</a>, <a href="#R61">61</a>]. This approach would guide science and society through research and learning processes
                                       in which they needed to jointly produce three types of knowledge: systems knowledge,
                                       which delineates the sustainability problem to be addressed and the associated subsystem
                                       or context (“What is?”); target knowledge, which encompasses negotiated values and
                                       goals for a shared vision of a sustainable future (“What ought to be?”); and transformation
                                       knowledge, which describes the path to follow in order to achieve a sustainable future
                                       (“How do we get there?”) [<a href="#R39">39</a>, <a href="#R52">52</a>, <a href="#R60">60</a>]. In such an understanding, knowledge and innovation for sustainable development
                                       are necessarily an outcome of joint learning processes that involve all societal actors.
                                       Accordingly, ESAPP framed research for sustainable development as what Gergen [<a href="#R05">5</a>] has called a future forming practice. The programme constituted itself as a communicative
                                       space [<a href="#R54">54</a>, <a href="#R62">62</a>] embedded in an open framework of research partnerships. ESAPP's developers further
                                       acknowledged that partnership as a third epistemological pillar required special attention.
                                       In North–South research partnerships, disparities with regard to power, knowledge,
                                       and resources often constrain balanced exchange and cooperation, as the research is
                                       generally financed, initiated, managed, and evaluated by Northern institutions [<a href="#R63">63</a>]. In a network as complex as ESAPP's, this calls for efforts to expand deliberative
                                       capacity, for a devolution of power, and for ensuring accountability and legitimacy
                                       towards both funding organizations and partners within and beyond the research network
                                       [<a href="#R08">8</a>, <a href="#R39">39</a>]. It requires management strategies and organizational structures that promote Southern
                                       partners' determination, competence, and ownership with respect to the formulation
                                       of pathways to sustainable development [<a href="#R43">43</a>, <a href="#R56">56</a>]. And this, in turn, calls for pragmatism [<a href="#R03">3</a>, <a href="#R64">64</a>]. Pursuing equity as a structural goal within ESAPP was both fundamental and innovative.

                                       In line with CDE’s core competence, ESAPP focused on contextualized knowledge about
                                       sustainable land management and sustainable regional development and promoted local
                                       and regional initiatives through transdisciplinary research. Knowledge has to be generated
                                       and processed together with local actors to be robustly coupled to human-environment-system
                                       dynamics in a specific context [<a href="#R33">33</a>, <a href="#R64">64</a>, <a href="#R65">65</a>]. In the African context, a vast majority of people depend on direct access to renewable
                                       natural resources, while competing claims and short-term needs at various scales tend
                                       to override environmental concerns, aggravate poverty, and inhibit economic development
                                       [<a href="#R66">66</a>]. The result is a dwindling resource base, which often goes unnoticed for a long
                                       time. The programme’s stewardship of the environment does not constitute a case of
                                       the environmental bias observed by Waas and colleagues [<a href="#R04">4</a>]; it is a necessity. After many decades of neglect, rural areas and the livelihoods
                                       of small-scale resource users are now being reappraised based on the recognition that
                                       global governance approaches, adaptation and mitigation strategies must build on knowledge
                                       of local conditions to be effective [<a href="#R21">21</a>, <a href="#R67">67</a>].

                                       research framework opened up a door to many new challenges. One of these challenges
                                       is the dual role of scientists doing transformative research: they must work to provide
                                       evidence while simultaneously expanding human and institutional capacity for sustainable
                                       development by means of education and training, collaborative research and learning
                                       processes, as well as knowledge brokering activities and products [<a href="#R30">30</a>, <a href="#R50">50</a>, <a href="#R53">53</a>, <a href="#R63">63</a>]. How then should inter- and transdisciplinary research be (re-)organized and structured?
                                       A sophisticated research framework is provided by the Earth System Governance Project,
                                       which organizes research around five analytical problems: architecture, agency, adaptiveness,
                                       accountability, and allocation &amp; access. At the same time power, knowledge, norms,
                                       and scale are regarded as crosscutting research themes that are crucial to the study
                                       of each analytical problem and also to an integrated understanding of earth system
                                       governance. Related thematic issues are embedded in flagship activities [<a href="#R37">37</a>]. This research framework outlines, in a very useful way, the basic challenge of
                                       coherently integrating facts and values in a transdisciplinary research programme
                                       [<a href="#R37">37</a>, <a href="#R47">47</a>]. In ESAPP, conceptual and operational challenges or necessary trade-offs at the
                                       science–policy interface were addressed by combining the open partnership and research
                                       framework with recursive and (self-)reflexive processes that the project partners
                                       steered jointly [<a href="#R39">39</a>]. Three structural approaches provided the necessary guidance (see also [<a href="#R58">58</a>]):

                                                Widely accepted today, adaptive management of a research programme was innovative
                                                at the turn of the millennium. ESAPP’s adaptive management approach was intended to
                                                provide the necessary basic stability in the institutional fabric while allowing for
                                                goals, institutional structures, and research procedures to be reshaped in the course
                                                of the programme’s implementation. It offered space for integrating feedback and research
                                                results into management decisions and securing meaningful participation and institutional

                                                imperatives. This may result in a one-sided focus on either basic research or action
                                                research, or in the latter being viewed as a mere add-on to business-as-usual science.
                                                To accommodate both need-driven and concept-driven concerns, ESAPP linked action research
                                                with basic research and capacity development. The two components were intended to
                                                interact, reinforce each other, and eventually reshape the programme. ESAPP’s action
                                                research component comprised over 300 small-grant priority action projects formulated

                                    <p id="d1e562">As argued above, in order to support a sustainability transformation, scientists need
                                       to strengthen the deliberative capacity of research— understood as a political system—by
                                       means of adequate structures and procedures. Adequacy in this context means that they
                                       are in line with the fundamental normative, democratic and procedural principles of
                                       sustainable development. It is in collaborative and reflexive processes that partners
                                       in research share and integrate values, norms, and perceptions, tackle dissent, and
                                       create a “common culture”. This shifts the focus from research outcomes to the processes
                                       of social knowledge generation; to experimentation, learning, and constant change
                                       under an adaptive governance approach [<a href="#R30">30</a>, <a href="#R53">53</a>, <a href="#R62">62</a>]. The “communicative space”—actual or virtual meeting places—and the deliberate and
                                       consequential quality of exchange become a subject of analysis: Where do researchers,
                                       partners, and actors interact, and what exactly are they doing there? But first of
                                       all, people need to be brought together. For the ESAPP as a transnational research
                                       programme, this was not only a logistical problem. Organizing joint processes among
                                       partners with different cultural backgrounds and varying institutional strength requires
                                       time, resources, and mutual trust. Over the years, ESAPP partners successfully organized
                                       an iterative process of reflection and adaptation within routine modes and places
                                       of exchange. The following elements and milestones of partners' interaction were crucial
                                       to this success:

                                                of related Swiss institutions. Southern partners were not represented until 2011.
                                                But early assessments emphasized the need for strengthening Southern partners' capacity
                                                and ownership to increase equity and ensure research coherence, relevance, and quality
                                                for the benefit of the South. Eventually, in 2006, partners initiated annual one-week
                                                capitalization workshops in the South to overcome geographic distance, foster communication,
                                                and exchange on a regular base. The workshops immediately became the cornerstone of
                                                joint programme management. Here, ESAPP partners met for data and method sharing,
                                                deliberation and self-evaluation, strategic reorientation, and a field excursion.
                                                Here, they applied and further developed ESAPP's management tools, settled conflictive
                                                issues, and made necessary changes in the programme's organizational structure and
                                                research design.

                                                goals and indicators valued in the North. In the course of time, partners jointly
                                                identified new forms of process benchmarking: They developed an appropriate monitoring
                                                and evaluation system that combined reflexive elements (self-evaluation, feedback
                                                loops) with simple and easy-to-understand standard formats (project documents, catalogues
                                                of criteria, target matrices/log frames, statistical evaluations, etc.) and standard

                                                Being fairly consistent, lean, and procedural, ESAPP's monitoring and evaluation system
                                                served as a navigation tool [<a href="#R45">45</a>].

                                                contexts, ESAPP was confronted with high numbers of priority action project proposals.
                                                To secure ESAPP's mission and scope, the partners established a process of clustering
                                                and sequencing thematically related projects. A preselection of projects was done
                                                by the coordinators in the respective partner countries. In the annual capitalization
                                                workshops, projects were further discussed, evaluated, and related to one another.
                                                Eventually, this led to the creation of thematic partnerships between countries which
                                                promoted the scaling up and out of results within the whole region. Finally, ESAPP
                                                consolidated its research in ten reference sites characterized by context-specific
                                                priorities within the region. This procedural thematic concentration made it possible
                                                to use research results of more than 300 priority action projects as evidence in an

                                                able to initiate new strategic collaborations and networks. The ESAPP network also

                              <p id="d1e612">A sustainability transformation requires novel research frameworks and programme structures
                                 that accommodate processual and democratic features such as normativity, equity, integration,
                                 dynamism, inclusiveness, accountability, legitimacy, deliberation, and others [<a href="#R04">4</a>, <a href="#R25">25</a>, <a href="#R37">37</a>]. The Eastern and Southern Africa Partnership Programme, ESAPP, was as an early transdisciplinary
                                 research endeavour that successfully endorsed inclusive, authentic, and consequential
                                 deliberation and joint programme navigation balancing local needs and sustainability
                                 demands. The programme thus fulfilled the dual role which is compulsory in transformative
                                 research: It generated contextualized knowledge and innovation at the science–society
                                 interface while at the same time securing meaningful participation and Southern agency
                                 in a co-evolutionary process [<a href="#R54">54</a>, <a href="#R68">68</a>]. But despite ESAPP’s widely acknowledged success, the programme’s final assessments
                                 list major shortcomings [<a href="#R57">57</a>, <a href="#R58">58</a>]. For example, research in the complex transnational and transcultural context of
                                 ESAPP was constrained considerably by standard planning and budget frameworks, which
                                 generally do not favour experimental procedures and equity approaches. Insufficient
                                 human and institutional capacities, a lack of ownership among the funding and collaborating
                                 institutions, and weak South–South engagement were other limiting factors. The jointly
                                 developed monitoring and evaluation system for guiding both action research projects
                                 and institutional development remained insufficiently coherent. Managing a comprehensive
                                 database and relating it to existing regional environmental databases and global observatories
                                 proved too ambitious and challenging for a research programme as small as ESAPP. In
                                 some countries, the number of action research projects was too small to enable meaningful
                                 clustering and scaling up of results. The programme's success in strengthening the
                                 Southern network and equitable South–South exchange was limited by differences in
                                 political and institutional backgrounds and by national interests overriding collaborative
                                 efforts. Although promising ways of tackling stumbling blocks and trade-offs at the
                                 interfaces between science, society, and policy are well-described [<a href="#R36">36</a>, <a href="#R39">39</a>, <a href="#R47">47</a>] and were included in ESAPP's design, the programme's implementation was continuously
                                 contested by partners within and beyond the programme. Here, the sustainability paradigm
                                 unfolded its integrative and transformative power and helped to focus collaborative
                                 processes within the programme. Taken as a superordinate system of reference that
                                 is valid for all actors involved, it implied, and guided equity-based and democratic
                                 processes of research, learning, and innovation. A basic characteristic was that actors
                                 jointly identified research needs and approaches, and that they jointly assessed,
                                 evaluated, and reused evidence and innovations.

                              <p id="d1e645">Such reflexive and recursive processes are well-suited for integrating different development
                                 and innovation paradigms in a fruitful way, particularly the dominant <i>innovation paradigm that takes science as its frame of reference</i>—that is, where scientists and researchers provide and transfer the “right” knowledge
                                 and solutions to decision-makers—and the fairly widespread <i>innovation paradigm that builds on interaction between science and society</i>. Both paradigms have proved to be insufficient in themselves, but they can nonetheless
                                 be an important part of solutions for sustainable development. In ESAPP's final report
                                 [<a href="#R57">57</a>], partners provide many examples. But an important lesson learned during ESAPP is
                                 that the sustainability paradigm goes beyond the innovation paradigm building on science–society
                                 interaction. Born in the spirit of the 1980s, this innovation paradigm holds that
                                 scientists and civil society should communicate to improve the efficiency and effectiveness
                                 of development measures, enable evidence-based decision-making, and ensure an ethically
                                 sound application of knowledge. But this paradigm causes misunderstandings, resistance,
                                 and conflicts because actors in science, governmental and non-governmental institutions,
                                 business, and communities relate to different systems of reference. The concept of
                                 science–society interaction remains vague; criteria and measures of evidence and success
                                 depend on the different actors' negotiation power; and power disparities increase
                                 the commodification and economic evaluation of research [<a href="#R49">49</a>]. By contrast, an innovation paradigm that takes sustainable development as its overarching
                                 emancipatory frame of reference—as applied in ESAPP—opens ways out of the confusion
                                 that characterizes the post-Brundtland world. It replaces unspecific interaction between
                                 science and society by integrating actors, knowledge, and value systems in joint learning
                                 processes, and supports the fundamentally novel understanding of knowledge and innovation
                                 applied in sustainability science. It enables sustainability-oriented actors from
                                 all scientific and practical fields to seek consilience [<a href="#R34">34</a>], and synchronize their development agendas and research frameworks on behalf of
                                 societal co-production of knowledge and innovation.

                              <p id="d1e662">But transdisciplinary practice is inherently complex, resource-consuming, and often
                                 fails. We must bear in mind that in the complexity of future forming processes, or
                                 “research in a world of flux” ([<a href="#R05">5</a>] p. 11), achievements – but also shortcomings—are always preliminary, procedural,
                                 and gradual. Nevertheless, transformative science is a necessary counterculture to
                                 today's technocratic focus on evidence and outputs. It requires long-term commitments,
                                 collaborations and partnerships, as well as strong leadership by visionary actors
                                 in science and practice. In light of ESAPP's experience, researchers, policymakers,
                                 and funding institutions would do well to conceive of North–South research partnerships
                                 as a long-term, co-evolutional process between countries and world regions. As Garud
                                 and Geman ([<a href="#R41">41</a>] p. 992) put it, “(…) the challenge for policy, strategy and research is not just
                                 a matter of becoming sustainable, but of sustaining the ability to embark on such
