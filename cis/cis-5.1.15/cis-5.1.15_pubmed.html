                     have re- confirmed the relevance of sustainability as the guiding paradigm in countering
                     the development and climate crisis of the Anthropocene. Recent decades however, have
                     been characterized by confusion, contestations, and arbitrariness in defining the
                     nature and pathways of sustainable development. Humanity must urgently find ways to
                     unlock the potential of the sustainability paradigm and organize a sustainability
                     transforma- tion. An emerging sustainability science community has already established
                     considerable consensus on essential features of transformative science and research.
                     Sustainability scholars are providing growing evidence that an emancipatory and democratic
                     construction of sustainable development and more equitable, deliberative, and democratized
                     knowledge generation are pivotal in tackling sustainability challenges. These findings
                     are further underpinned by experiences gained in the Eastern and Southern Africa Partnership
                     Programme (1999–2015)—a rare case of a long-term, transnational, and transdisciplinary
                     research en- deavour already completed. The programme fulfilled the dual role which
                     is compulsory in transformative research: It generated contextualized knowledge and
                     innovation at the science–society interface while simultaneously securing meaningful
                     participation and Southern agency in a co-evolutionary process. This paper offers
                     insight into the programme’s adaptive structure and implementation processes, which
                     fostered deliberation, capacity development, and joint programme navigation benchmarked
                     against local needs and broader sustainability demands. The ESAPP experience confirms
                     that, if taken as the overarching frame of reference for all actors involved, the
                     sustainability paradigm unfolds its integrative and transformative power. It enables
                     sustainability-oriented actors from all scientific and practical fields to seek consilience
                     between differing development and innovation paradigms and synchronize their development
                     agendas and research frameworks on behalf of societal co-production of knowledge and
                     innovation. Accordingly, the sustainability paradigm has the power to guide development
                     and innovation policy, and practice out of the current confusion and ineffectiveness.

               <p id="d1e88">At the 2015 United Nations Sustainable Development Summit in New York, world leaders
                  responded to alarming scientific evidence showing that we humans are interfering with
                  the Earth system at a scale and magnitude that threatens our own survival. With the
                  adoption of the <i>2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals</i> (SDGs), they reconfirmed the primacy of sustainability as the guiding development
                  paradigm (UN, 2015). Framed in the so-called “Brundtland Report” [<a href="#R01">1</a>] and endorsed at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio, the sustainability paradigm is not
                  novel; and looking back, it has fallen short of expectations in various ways. Nevertheless
                  it continues to be the official global response to the development and climate crisis
                  of the Anthropocene. But—and this is confirmed by the renewed global commitment—science
                  and society must urgently find ways to unlock its potential and organize a sustainability
                  transformation [<a href="#R02">2</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e99">The Post-Brundtland world is characterized by confusion, contestations, and arbitrariness
                  in identifying the nature and pathways of sustainable development [<a href="#R03">3</a>, <a href="#R04">4</a>, <a href="#R05">5</a>]. The implications of the sustainability paradigm as an antithesis to the paradigm
                  of growth and transfer are not easy to capture. Although our understanding of development
                  intervention and global governance has fundamentally changed [<a href="#R06">6</a>, <a href="#R07">7</a>, <a href="#R08">8</a>], the normativity and the transformative power of sustainability have reached buzzword
                  status [<a href="#R09">9</a>]. At the same time, unorthodox scholars across diverse fields in science, technology,
                  and development, have observed narrow, exploitative, and often destructive use of
                  promising post-Rio development concepts such as innovation [<a href="#R10">10</a>, <a href="#R11">11</a>], gender mainstreaming [<a href="#R12">12</a>], livelihoods [<a href="#R13">13</a>, <a href="#R14">14</a>], justice [<a href="#R15">15</a>], or transformation [<a href="#R16">16</a>], to mention just a few. Scholars argue that systemic thinking, equity-based science-society
                  interaction, and reflexive learning – which are all indispensable in generating knowledge
                  and innovation for sustainable development—continue to be marginalized, confined to
                  single sectors, and used to serve vested interests [<a href="#R17">17</a>, <a href="#R18">18</a>, <a href="#R19">19</a>]. Despite progress on the integration of civil society in global environmental assessments
                  and negotiations, power disparities and self-interest are hampering action and creating
                  new tensions, disparities, and bargaining between the global North and South [<a href="#R20">20</a>, <a href="#R21">21</a>, <a href="#R22">22</a>, <a href="#R23">23</a>]. While economic bias gets much of the attention in the debate, sustainability scholars
                  also criticize frequent environmental bias at the expense of human and social issues
                  [<a href="#R04">4</a>], and social bias. The latter prevailed in the Millennium Development Goals, for
                  example [<a href="#R24">24</a>]. Spangenberg ([<a href="#R18">18</a>] p. 277) points out a damaging “trend towards a further fragmentation of research
                  concerning the substance of sustainability”. Skoglund and Jensen ([<a href="#R22">22</a>] p. 124) provide a striking example of how climate policy is misguided; they refer
                  to Chandler (2012), who showed “how different policies and non-governmental organizations
                  rely on the `adaptation agenda' to suggest survival strategies for the poor: thus
                  attempting to align the marginalized with `vulnerability to climate change', instead
                  of addressing the broader economic and social factors that gave rise to their marginalized
                  position”. Such examples illustrate how concrete efforts and successes fade in an
                  amalgam of overlapping and often contradictory approaches and discourses ranging from
                  mainstream sustainability to green radicalism [<a href="#R25">25</a>], or from weak sustainability to more radical constructions of strong sustainability
                  [<a href="#R04">4</a>, <a href="#R26">26</a>, <a href="#R27">27</a>]. As a consequence, the pre-Brundtland paradigm of growth, with its “loading-dock
                  approach” [<a href="#R28">28</a>] of transferring scientific and technological solutions to decision-makers, is persisting
                  [<a href="#R29">29</a>, <a href="#R30">30</a>]. To break its dominance and unlock transformative potentials, sustainability advocates
                  have begun to reclaim the emancipatory power inherent in the original conceptualizations
                  of development in their respective disciplines and practical domains. Taking systems
                  approaches, they strive for epistemological and practical grounding as well as for
                  further clarification of the interfaces between diverse development concepts (see,
                  for example, [<a href="#R09">9</a>, <a href="#R10">10</a>, <a href="#R11">11</a>, <a href="#R19">19</a>, <a href="#R31">31</a>, <a href="#R32">32</a>, <a href="#R33">33</a>, <a href="#R34">34</a>]).
               </p>
               <p id="d1e227">This leads to the approach I take in this paper. My overarching question is: How can
                  science contribute to a sustainability transformation? More specifically, I reflect
                  on various aspects that are essential in organizing transformative research. I argue
                  that an emancipatory and democratic construction of sustainable development is pivotal
                  in tackling sustainability challenges. An emerging sustainability science is providing
                  growing evidence of this fact. I further underpin my argument with experiences gained
                  in the <i>Eastern and Southern Africa Partnership Programme</i>—a rare case of a long-term transdisciplinary research endeavour already completed.
                  With my contribution, I intend to confirm that, if taken as the principal frame of
                  reference, sustainable development is suited to integrate the efforts of sustainability-oriented
                  scholars and practitioners across different profiles. It provides orientation in synchronizing
                  development agendas and frameworks towards societal co-production of knowledge and
                  innovation. Accordingly, the sustainability paradigm has the power to guide development
                  and innovation policy and practice out of the current confusion and ineffectiveness.

               <p id="d1e235">Fortunately, we can build on promising achievements in transformative research. A
                  multitude of reviews and syntheses show how an emerging sustainability science community
                  is establishing considerable consensus on the sustainability paradigm's epistemological
                  and practical implications for science and research (see, for example, [<a href="#R08">8</a>, <a href="#R16">16</a>, <a href="#R18">18</a>, <a href="#R22">22</a>, <a href="#R27">27</a>, <a href="#R29">29</a>, <a href="#R35">35</a>]). With a view to promoting equity-based, just development within the planetary boundaries,
                  scholars are working to identify enabling institutional contexts and developing transdisciplinary
                  research frameworks and procedures across scientific disciplines and at the interfaces
                  between science and society, as well as between science and policy [<a href="#R32">32</a>, <a href="#R36">36</a>, <a href="#R37">37</a>, <a href="#R38">38</a>, <a href="#R39">39</a>, <a href="#R40">40</a>]. They conceive of sustainability as a societal future forming process [<a href="#R05">5</a>], as it “emerges as a horizon to be approached but never reached” ([<a href="#R42">42</a>] p. 992). Accordingly, transdisciplinary theory and practice must accommodate pluralism
                  and experimentation. But, as Waas and colleagues ([<a href="#R04">4</a>] p. 1645) point out, this future forming process has to be benchmarked against the
                  “precise and unambiguous meaning” of the original conceptualization of sustainable
                  development. They identify four fundamental principles—normativity, equity, integration,
                  and dynamism—that “represent the interpretational limits of the concept and are essential
                  to sustainability no matter which view and interpretation is employed” ([<a href="#R04">4</a>] p. 1657). Such (and analogous) principles respond to the complexity and adaptiveness
                  of human–environment systems—which are the subject under consideration [<a href="#R33">33</a>, <a href="#R43">43</a>]—and provide orientation for societal future forming processes and “research in a
                  world of flux” ([<a href="#R05">5</a>] p. 11). Ethical and equity concerns further underpin sustainable development as
                  an emancipatory and transformative concept and open the floor for contesting existing
                  power structures and decision-making processes [<a href="#R16">16</a>, <a href="#R26">26</a>, <a href="#R44">44</a>]. Not only natural resources but also social capital and knowledge must be distributed
                  equally [<a href="#R23">23</a>, <a href="#R45">45</a>, <a href="#R46">46</a>, <a href="#R47">47</a>]. This requires us to rethink our understanding of knowledge and expertise, and to
                  revise our traditional role and (self-)conception as researchers [<a href="#R41">41</a>, <a href="#R48">48</a>, <a href="#R49">49</a>]. Normative, democratic and procedural principles are at the core of transdisciplinary
                  practice, in which scholars attempt to link science and civil society in joint reflexive
                  or learning processes [<a href="#R17">17</a>, <a href="#R18">18</a>, <a href="#R26">26</a>, <a href="#R38">38</a>, <a href="#R40">40</a>]. Building on such critical reflection, sustainability scholars are bringing together
                  long-standing participatory, democratic, and social movements' traditions and structuring
                  research along new, deliberate forms of science–society interaction [<a href="#R51">51</a>, <a href="#R52">52</a>, <a href="#R53">53</a>, <a href="#R54">54</a>]. In a deliberative democracy, or indeed in any deliberative system, actors participate
                  in a communicative process and influence collective decisions [<a href="#R25">25</a>, <a href="#R55">55</a>]. If we understand a research framework or programme as a deliberative system, its
                  deliberative capacity—“the extent to which a political system possesses structures
                  to host deliberation that is authentic, inclusive, and consequential” [<a href="#R51">51</a>]—gains utmost importance. But the deliberative capacity of individuals and institutions
                  involved must likewise be secured for their equal and meaningful inclusion in future
                  forming processes.  As well as putting equity and power issues to the fore, this undergirds
                  the strategic goal framed by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
                  Organization to develop knowledge societies by democratizing knowledge and knowledge
                  generation [<a href="#R56">56</a>]. Indeed, progress in the democratization of knowledge has been observed [<a href="#R57">57</a>], and sustainability science is making headway. But transdisciplinarity is a relatively
                  young field, and experiences of long-term transdisciplinary practice at a transnational,
                  regional scale are particularly rare.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e376">In the following, I will present the <i>Eastern and Southern Africa Partnership Programme</i> (ESAPP) as a research endeavour that is well-suited to help fill this gap. Running
                  from 1999 to 2015, the programme brought together partners from Switzerland, Kenya,
                  Ethiopia, Tanzania, Madagascar, Mozambique, and Eritrea in conducting long-term transdisciplinary
                  research for sustainable land management and sustainable regional development. Two
                  final publications provide substantial insights into this experience. Ehrensperger
                  and colleagues present ESAPP's research and outcomes [<a href="#R58">58</a>], while Ott and Kiteme [<a href="#R59">59</a>] provide more in-depth reflections on the implementation, adaptation, and learning
                  processes that took place within ESAPP. Taking up the arguments outlined above, I
                  present programme features that proved to be supportive in strengthening deliberative
                  capacity, equity-based knowledge generation, and institutional development for coherent
                  local to global governance. I further discuss specific challenges that arose during
                  the implementation of this transdisciplinary and transnational research programme
                  as well as in securing its legacy.

               <p id="d1e393">When ESAPP was framed in the late 1990s, both public involvement and sustainability
                  science were in their infancy. Ott and Kiteme [<a href="#R58">58</a>] show how three contextual developments at the interface between science and policymaking
                  had prepared the ground for ESAPP's unique and innovative programme design: First,
                  decades of research collaborations and networking between Switzerland and countries
                  in Eastern Africa had established trust and fruitful interaction between scientists,
                  funding organizations, as well as governmental and non-governmental actors and institutions
                  of the countries involved. This led to the launching of an integrative research programme
                  that matched the scientific and political landscape of Eastern Africa. Second, since
                  1988, ESAPP's mother institution, the University of Bern's <i>Centre for Development and Environment </i>(CDE), had been mandated by the <i>Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation</i> (SDC) to help prepare Switzerland's position on the 1992 Rio conventions and translate
                  them into poverty alleviation policy and practice. Already in the 1990s, CDE had come
                  up with integrative, participatory concepts and tools designed to support human agency,
                  science–society interaction, and social learning [<a href="#R59">59</a>]. Third, the programme designers could build on long-standing activities of a loose
                  network of sustainability-oriented scholars and practitioners in Switzerland. In 1997,
                  representatives from CDE and the Swiss Academy of Sciences and its <i>Commission for Research Partnerships with Developing Countries</i> (KFPE) drafted the KFPE's 11 Principles and 7 Questions as a guide for transdisciplinary
                  and transnational research partnerships for sustainable development [<a href="#R44">44</a>, <a href="#R60">60</a>]. The KFPE guide is heavily equity-oriented and reflects state-of-the-art sustainability
                  science even today. It underpins the choice of sustainable development, partnership,
                  and transdisciplinarity as ESAPP's core foundations. The well-established collaboration
                  between scientists, practitioners, and policymakers enabled SDC as the funding institution
                  to give ESAPP's architects considerable leeway; at the same time, SDC was represented
                  on ESAPP's advisory board—the programme's steering committee—from the outset. Such
                  long-standing and trustful collaboration between researchers, funding organisations,
                  and research users in the North and South, must be considered a precondition for transformative
                  research [<a href="#R58">58</a>].

                  Partnership
               </h3>
               <p id="d1e423">ESAPP was launched in 1999 with the mission of generating new knowledge and innovation
                  for sustainable development on local to regional levels. The programme was aimed at
                  mitigating sustainability challenges by making knowledge generation more democratic
                  and accessible, increasing Southern ownership and agency, producing innovative research
                  results, and promoting evidence-based, South-driven sustainable rural development.
                  Transdisciplinarity as the second epistemological pillar of ESAPP was understood as
                  an integrative approach that brings together scientific (disciplinary and interdisciplinary)
                  and non-scientific (endogenous, indigenous, cultural, local, etc.) knowledge systems;
                  academic, social, and political actors and institutions; and different places and
                  scales [<a href="#R51">51</a>, <a href="#R61">61</a>]. This approach would guide science and society through research and learning processes
                  in which they needed to jointly produce three types of knowledge: systems knowledge,
                  which delineates the sustainability problem to be addressed and the associated subsystem
                  or context (“What is?”); target knowledge, which encompasses negotiated values and
                  goals for a shared vision of a sustainable future (“What ought to be?”); and transformation
                  knowledge, which describes the path to follow in order to achieve a sustainable future
                  (“How do we get there?”) [<a href="#R39">39</a>, <a href="#R52">52</a>, <a href="#R60">60</a>]. In such an understanding, knowledge and innovation for sustainable development
                  are necessarily an outcome of joint learning processes that involve all societal actors.
                  Accordingly, ESAPP framed research for sustainable development as what Gergen [<a href="#R05">5</a>] has called a future forming practice. The programme constituted itself as a communicative
                  space [<a href="#R54">54</a>, <a href="#R62">62</a>] embedded in an open framework of research partnerships. ESAPP's developers further
                  acknowledged that partnership as a third epistemological pillar required special attention.
                  In North–South research partnerships, disparities with regard to power, knowledge,
                  and resources often constrain balanced exchange and cooperation, as the research is
                  generally financed, initiated, managed, and evaluated by Northern institutions [<a href="#R63">63</a>]. In a network as complex as ESAPP's, this calls for efforts to expand deliberative
                  capacity, for a devolution of power, and for ensuring accountability and legitimacy
                  towards both funding organizations and partners within and beyond the research network
                  [<a href="#R08">8</a>, <a href="#R39">39</a>]. It requires management strategies and organizational structures that promote Southern
                  partners' determination, competence, and ownership with respect to the formulation
                  of pathways to sustainable development [<a href="#R43">43</a>, <a href="#R56">56</a>]. And this, in turn, calls for pragmatism [<a href="#R03">3</a>, <a href="#R64">64</a>]. Pursuing equity as a structural goal within ESAPP was both fundamental and innovative.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e472">Another central conceptual element in ESAPP was its thematic and spatial concentration.
                  In line with CDE’s core competence, ESAPP focused on contextualized knowledge about
                  sustainable land management and sustainable regional development and promoted local
                  and regional initiatives through transdisciplinary research. Knowledge has to be generated
                  and processed together with local actors to be robustly coupled to human-environment-system
                  dynamics in a specific context [<a href="#R33">33</a>, <a href="#R64">64</a>, <a href="#R65">65</a>]. In the African context, a vast majority of people depend on direct access to renewable
                  natural resources, while competing claims and short-term needs at various scales tend
                  to override environmental concerns, aggravate poverty, and inhibit economic development
                  [<a href="#R66">66</a>]. The result is a dwindling resource base, which often goes unnoticed for a long
                  time. The programme’s stewardship of the environment does not constitute a case of
                  the environmental bias observed by Waas and colleagues [<a href="#R04">4</a>]; it is a necessity. After many decades of neglect, rural areas and the livelihoods
                  of small-scale resource users are now being reappraised based on the recognition that
                  global governance approaches, adaptation and mitigation strategies must build on knowledge
                  of local conditions to be effective [<a href="#R21">21</a>, <a href="#R67">67</a>].

               <p id="d1e499">ESAPP’s designers were well aware that the programme's transdisciplinary and transnational
                  research framework opened up a door to many new challenges. One of these challenges
                  is the dual role of scientists doing transformative research: they must work to provide
                  evidence while simultaneously expanding human and institutional capacity for sustainable
                  development by means of education and training, collaborative research and learning
                  processes, as well as knowledge brokering activities and products [<a href="#R30">30</a>, <a href="#R50">50</a>, <a href="#R53">53</a>, <a href="#R63">63</a>]. How then should inter- and transdisciplinary research be (re-)organized and structured?
                  A sophisticated research framework is provided by the Earth System Governance Project,
                  which organizes research around five analytical problems: architecture, agency, adaptiveness,
                  accountability, and allocation &amp; access. At the same time power, knowledge, norms,
                  and scale are regarded as crosscutting research themes that are crucial to the study
                  of each analytical problem and also to an integrated understanding of earth system
                  governance. Related thematic issues are embedded in flagship activities [<a href="#R37">37</a>]. This research framework outlines, in a very useful way, the basic challenge of
                  coherently integrating facts and values in a transdisciplinary research programme
                  [<a href="#R37">37</a>, <a href="#R47">47</a>]. In ESAPP, conceptual and operational challenges or necessary trade-offs at the
                  science–policy interface were addressed by combining the open partnership and research
                  framework with recursive and (self-)reflexive processes that the project partners
                  steered jointly [<a href="#R39">39</a>]. Three structural approaches provided the necessary guidance (see also [<a href="#R58">58</a>]):

                           Widely accepted today, adaptive management of a research programme was innovative
                           at the turn of the millennium. ESAPP’s adaptive management approach was intended to
                           provide the necessary basic stability in the institutional fabric while allowing for
                           goals, institutional structures, and research procedures to be reshaped in the course
                           of the programme’s implementation. It offered space for integrating feedback and research
                           results into management decisions and securing meaningful participation and institutional
                           development.

                           <i>A dual-structure approach that harmonizes concepts and action</i>: In development contexts, short-term priorities often override long-term sustainability
                           imperatives. This may result in a one-sided focus on either basic research or action
                           research, or in the latter being viewed as a mere add-on to business-as-usual science.
                           To accommodate both need-driven and concept-driven concerns, ESAPP linked action research
                           with basic research and capacity development. The two components were intended to
                           interact, reinforce each other, and eventually reshape the programme. ESAPP’s action
                           research component comprised over 300 small-grant priority action projects formulated
                           by local partners alone or in collaboration with ESAPP researchers. The basic research
                           and capacity development component mainly served to provide support and secure programme
                           coherence, consistency, and effectiveness through reflection, learning, and adaptation.

                           <i>A contextuality approach that links places and scales</i>: At its outset, ESAPP was mandated to build on contextualized knowledge, databases,
                           capacities and partner networks created by CDE's predecessor programmes in Africa;
                           to further develop their transdisciplinary character; and to make them available for
                           decision-making support and further research. Knowledge and data for sustainable land
                           management and sustainable regional development that are contextualized—embedded in
                           a specific time, place, and scale—are currently high on the global development agenda.
                           Building and consolidating bottom-up databases and linking them with regional or global
                           observatories is critical to enhancing coherence and consistency in governance approaches
                           from local to global levels. In addition, it is a key asset for developing countries
                           in formulating self-determined and just national development strategies and in interacting
                           with global development institutions [<a href="#R30">30</a>, <a href="#R64">64</a>].

               <p id="d1e562">As argued above, in order to support a sustainability transformation, scientists need
                  to strengthen the deliberative capacity of research— understood as a political system—by
                  means of adequate structures and procedures. Adequacy in this context means that they
                  are in line with the fundamental normative, democratic and procedural principles of
                  sustainable development. It is in collaborative and reflexive processes that partners
                  in research share and integrate values, norms, and perceptions, tackle dissent, and
                  create a “common culture”. This shifts the focus from research outcomes to the processes
                  of social knowledge generation; to experimentation, learning, and constant change
                  under an adaptive governance approach [<a href="#R30">30</a>, <a href="#R53">53</a>, <a href="#R62">62</a>]. The “communicative space”—actual or virtual meeting places—and the deliberate and
                  consequential quality of exchange become a subject of analysis: Where do researchers,
                  partners, and actors interact, and what exactly are they doing there? But first of
                  all, people need to be brought together. For the ESAPP as a transnational research
                  programme, this was not only a logistical problem. Organizing joint processes among
                  partners with different cultural backgrounds and varying institutional strength requires
                  time, resources, and mutual trust. Over the years, ESAPP partners successfully organized
                  an iterative process of reflection and adaptation within routine modes and places
                  of exchange. The following elements and milestones of partners' interaction were crucial
                  to this success:

                           <i>Institutionalizing joint programme steering</i>: Like many endeavours in the field of research for development, ESAPP was North-funded
                           and hence North-driven at its inception. The advisory board—the programme's steering
                           body—was composed by representatives of SDC as the funding institution, of CDE, and
                           of related Swiss institutions. Southern partners were not represented until 2011.
                           But early assessments emphasized the need for strengthening Southern partners' capacity
                           and ownership to increase equity and ensure research coherence, relevance, and quality
                           for the benefit of the South. Eventually, in 2006, partners initiated annual one-week
                           capitalization workshops in the South to overcome geographic distance, foster communication,
                           and exchange on a regular base. The workshops immediately became the cornerstone of
                           joint programme management. Here, ESAPP partners met for data and method sharing,
                           deliberation and self-evaluation, strategic reorientation, and a field excursion.
                           Here, they applied and further developed ESAPP's management tools, settled conflictive
                           issues, and made necessary changes in the programme's organizational structure and
                           research design.

                           identified new forms of process benchmarking: They developed an appropriate monitoring

                           loops) with simple and easy-to-understand standard formats (project documents, catalogues
                           of criteria, target matrices/log frames, statistical evaluations, etc.) and standard
                           procedures (advisory board meetings, project-cycle steps, external evaluations, etc.).
                           Being fairly consistent, lean, and procedural, ESAPP's monitoring and evaluation system
                           served as a navigation tool [<a href="#R45">45</a>].

                           <i>Scaling research results up and out</i>: Given the high pressure for quick and effective interventions in rural development
                           contexts, ESAPP was confronted with high numbers of priority action project proposals.
                           To secure ESAPP's mission and scope, the partners established a process of clustering
                           and sequencing thematically related projects. A preselection of projects was done
                           by the coordinators in the respective partner countries. In the annual capitalization
                           workshops, projects were further discussed, evaluated, and related to one another.
                           Eventually, this led to the creation of thematic partnerships between countries which
                           promoted the scaling up and out of results within the whole region. Finally, ESAPP
                           consolidated its research in ten reference sites characterized by context-specific
                           priorities within the region. This procedural thematic concentration made it possible
                           to use research results of more than 300 priority action projects as evidence in an
                           “ongoing process of evaluation, learning, adaptation and adoption” ([<a href="#R62">62</a>] p. 492).

                           that  links ecological and socio-economic quantitative and qualitative knowledge at

                           the database is a major tool for education and capacity development beyond the programme's
                           lifetime that led to the generation of local knowledge platforms and institutions.
                           The knowledge database also includes a set of transdisciplinary tools. Tools that

                           initially broad and loose networks. Southern institutions gradually became more equal
                           partners within the programme. Partner institutions were not equally strong in all
                           countries—indicating a need for better integration—but in some countries they were
                           able to initiate new strategic collaborations and networks. The ESAPP network also
                           includes hundreds of government officials, experts, and researchers that participated
                           in ESAPP training courses, especially in those organized by the Centre for Training
                           and Integrated Research in Arid and Semi-Arid Lands Development (CETRAD, Kenya). CETRAD
                           itself is a major outcome of research collaboration between Switzerland and Kenya.
                           The Water and Land Resource Centre (WLRC) in Ethiopia is another example. But many
                           other institutions, down to the village level, grew out of ESAPP research activities.

            <p id="d1e613">A sustainability transformation requires novel research frameworks and programme structures
               that accommodate processual and democratic features such as normativity, equity, integration,
               dynamism, inclusiveness, accountability, legitimacy, deliberation, and others [<a href="#R04">4</a>, <a href="#R25">25</a>, <a href="#R37">37</a>]. The Eastern and Southern Africa Partnership Programme, ESAPP, was as an early transdisciplinary
               research endeavour that successfully endorsed inclusive, authentic, and consequential
               deliberation and joint programme navigation balancing local needs and sustainability
               demands. The programme thus fulfilled the dual role which is compulsory in transformative
               research: It generated contextualized knowledge and innovation at the science–society
               interface while at the same time securing meaningful participation and Southern agency
               in a co-evolutionary process [<a href="#R54">54</a>, <a href="#R68">68</a>]. But despite ESAPP’s widely acknowledged success, the programme’s final assessments
               list major shortcomings [<a href="#R57">57</a>, <a href="#R58">58</a>]. For example, research in the complex transnational and transcultural context of
               ESAPP was constrained considerably by standard planning and budget frameworks, which
               generally do not favour experimental procedures and equity approaches. Insufficient
               human and institutional capacities, a lack of ownership among the funding and collaborating
               institutions, and weak South–South engagement were other limiting factors. The jointly
               developed monitoring and evaluation system for guiding both action research projects
               and institutional development remained insufficiently coherent. Managing a comprehensive
               database and relating it to existing regional environmental databases and global observatories
               proved too ambitious and challenging for a research programme as small as ESAPP. In
               some countries, the number of action research projects was too small to enable meaningful
               clustering and scaling up of results. The programme's success in strengthening the
               Southern network and equitable South–South exchange was limited by differences in
               political and institutional backgrounds and by national interests overriding collaborative
               efforts. Although promising ways of tackling stumbling blocks and trade-offs at the
               interfaces between science, society, and policy are well-described [<a href="#R36">36</a>, <a href="#R39">39</a>, <a href="#R47">47</a>] and were included in ESAPP's design, the programme's implementation was continuously
               contested by partners within and beyond the programme. Here, the sustainability paradigm
               unfolded its integrative and transformative power and helped to focus collaborative
               processes within the programme. Taken as a superordinate system of reference that
               is valid for all actors involved, it implied, and guided equity-based and democratic
               processes of research, learning, and innovation. A basic characteristic was that actors
               jointly identified research needs and approaches, and that they jointly assessed,
               evaluated, and reused evidence and innovations.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e646">Such reflexive and recursive processes are well-suited for integrating different development
               and innovation paradigms in a fruitful way, particularly the dominant <i>innovation paradigm that takes science as its frame of reference</i>—that is, where scientists and researchers provide and transfer the “right” knowledge
               and solutions to decision-makers—and the fairly widespread <i>innovation paradigm that builds on interaction between science and society</i>. Both paradigms have proved to be insufficient in themselves, but they can nonetheless
               be an important part of solutions for sustainable development. In ESAPP's final report
               [<a href="#R57">57</a>], partners provide many examples. But an important lesson learned during ESAPP is
               that the sustainability paradigm goes beyond the innovation paradigm building on science–society
               interaction. Born in the spirit of the 1980s, this innovation paradigm holds that
               scientists and civil society should communicate to improve the efficiency and effectiveness
               of development measures, enable evidence-based decision-making, and ensure an ethically
               sound application of knowledge. But this paradigm causes misunderstandings, resistance,
               and conflicts because actors in science, governmental and non-governmental institutions,
               business, and communities relate to different systems of reference. The concept of
               science–society interaction remains vague; criteria and measures of evidence and success
               depend on the different actors' negotiation power; and power disparities increase
               the commodification and economic evaluation of research [<a href="#R49">49</a>]. By contrast, an innovation paradigm that takes sustainable development as its overarching
               emancipatory frame of reference—as applied in ESAPP—opens ways out of the confusion
               that characterizes the post-Brundtland world. It replaces unspecific interaction between
               science and society by integrating actors, knowledge, and value systems in joint learning
               processes, and supports the fundamentally novel understanding of knowledge and innovation
               applied in sustainability science. It enables sustainability-oriented actors from
               all scientific and practical fields to seek consilience [<a href="#R34">34</a>], and synchronize their development agendas and research frameworks on behalf of
               societal co-production of knowledge and innovation.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e663">But transdisciplinary practice is inherently complex, resource-consuming, and often
               fails. We must bear in mind that in the complexity of future forming processes, or
               “research in a world of flux” ([<a href="#R05">5</a>] p. 11), achievements – but also shortcomings—are always preliminary, procedural,
               and gradual. Nevertheless, transformative science is a necessary counterculture to
               today's technocratic focus on evidence and outputs. It requires long-term commitments,
               collaborations and partnerships, as well as strong leadership by visionary actors
               in science and practice. In light of ESAPP's experience, researchers, policymakers,
               and funding institutions would do well to conceive of North–South research partnerships
               as a long-term, co-evolutional process between countries and world regions. As Garud
               and Geman ([<a href="#R41">41</a>] p. 992) put it, “(…) the challenge for policy, strategy and research is not just
               a matter of becoming sustainable, but of sustaining the ability to embark on such
               journeys on an ongoing basis”. If this journey ends when a programme is completed,
               the translation of transdisciplinarity into governance processes and institutions
               in partner countries in the global South will not endure.
