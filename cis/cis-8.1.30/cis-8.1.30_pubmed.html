                  <p class="first" id="d1e91">Human influences on Earth's natural systems are accelerating, with anthropogenic climate
                     and global change posing existential risks for mankind. To overcome the policy implementation
                     gap in practice both collective and transformative actions for sustainability involving
                     science, policy and society are urgently needed. In the realms of science, this relates
                     to taking inter-and transdisciplinary research approaches to foster exchange and co-designing
                     policy options between researcher, decision-makers and other societal stakeholders;
                     however, such collaboration is often limited by time, funding and complexity constrains.
                     This paper recognises that particularly early career climate change and sustainability
                     researchers are exposed to both the claim for and practical challenges of inter- and
                     transdisciplinarity. For a first qualitative investigation of Austrian early career
                     researchers’ preparedness for conducting participatory research with societal stakeholders,
                     this study examines perspectives of twelve early career researchers participating
                     in a young scientists' workshop.   Using a pre-post survey and analysing data by content,
                     our findings indicate that workshop participants have to manage stakeholder processes
                     directly after graduation and, due to a lack of methodological training, only use
                     a small fraction of existing social science methods and participatory settings for
                     stakeholder collaboration. To support other early career researchers and future students
                     in Austria in developing strong inter-and transdisciplinary research skills, we highlight
                     the added-value of integrating hands-on workshops with societal stakeholders, regular
                     exchange of lessons learned and transdisciplinary lectures into university education.
                     Offering more practice-oriented transdisciplinary learning activities during undergraduate
                     education, like excursions and mini-projects in which students can develop and train
                     participatory methods together with stakeholders under guidance, is believed to be
                     a fruitful strategy in this context.

               influence livelihoods on all continents [<a href="#R3">3</a>, <a href="#R4">4</a>]. Moreover, unsustainable consumption and other drivers turn out to endanger the
               planet’s biosphere. For example, plastic is found to pollute the Pacific Ocean [<a href="#R5">5</a>], and ongoing land-use changes could transform protected areas and ecosystems [<a href="#R6">6</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e142">Overcoming such grand environmental risks whilst avoiding substantial harm on human
               populations requires taking prompt and collective action to stabilize the Earth’s
               environmental systems and to guide societies towards sustainable development pathways
               [<a href="#R7">7</a>]. This and the ever-increasing urgency of enhanced actions towards sustainability
               are probably best exemplified by the United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Development Goals
               (SDGs) framework [<a href="#R8">8</a>] and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 [<a href="#R9">9</a>]. Other examples are the climate goals formulated by the 2015 Paris Agreement [<a href="#R10">10</a>] and derived regional and national climate mitigation and adaptation plans.

               <p id="d1e159">Despite progress on environmental and climate policies that has been made in the last
                  three to four decades, there remain apparently unbridgeable gaps between knowledge,
                  awareness and action for sustainability. For example, scientific evidence on anthropogenic
                  climate change did so far not translate into sufficient societal actions in line with
                  the Paris Agreement [<a href="#R11">11</a>]. Due to complexity and interconnectedness many risks of global environmental change
                  are poorly understood and traditional research has been fond not effective enough
                  in taking the perceptions of societal actors into perspective [<a href="#R12">12</a>]. To overcome this limitation to scientific knowledge production, inter- and transdisciplinary
                  approaches set out to cross disciplinary boundaries, whilst taking problem-driven
                  approaches is believed leading to increased collaboration with societal stakeholders
                  [<a href="#R13">13</a>, <a href="#R14">14</a>]. Linking academic knowledge with real-life actions should result in more robust
                  and socially accepted research outcomes [<a href="#R15">15</a>]. Specifically, the transdisciplinarity paradigm follows this notion and aims at
                  engaging with the hidden social complexities of modern environmental problems [<a href="#R16">16</a>, <a href="#R17">17</a>]. It is one objective of transdisciplinarity to evoke social learning for sustainability
                  [<a href="#R18">18</a>, <a href="#R19">19</a>, <a href="#R20">20</a>]; however, the societal outcomes of participatory research with stakeholders strongly
                  depends on researchers’ understanding of and competences for civic engagement. Prominent
                  stumbling-blocks for example are researchers’ poorly developed abilities to take multifaceted
                  approaches and their skills in mediating between diverging epistemological positions
                  [<a href="#R21">21</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e195">Challenges to collaboration with stakeholders across a spectrum from getting societal
                  insights, preferences and opinions all the way to longer-term involvement in experimentation
                  (e.g. urban living labs) also could arise from language differences [<a href="#R22">22</a>]. Moreover, science-society collaborations require researchers to be experienced
                  in managing group processes. Transdisciplinary endeavours for sustainability are further
                  complicated by uncertainty about the future [<a href="#R23">23</a>], conflicting expectations between stakeholders and researchers [<a href="#R24">24</a>], issues related to scientific credibility and impact evaluation [<a href="#R25">25</a>, <a href="#R26">26</a>]. The manifold practical challenges to successful stakeholder involvement suggest
                  that better preparing present and future scholars for inter-and transdisciplinarity
                  should be of uttermost importance for the scientific community.

                  Change and Sustainability Research
               </h3>
               <p id="d1e215">In this paper, we focus on early career climate change and sustainability researchers
                  (including early professionals) and their previous and ongoing education on transdisciplinary
                  stakeholder involvement. We also study their practical experiences when collaborating
                  with stakeholders in research practice across the continuum from collecting societal
                  insights to the involvement in real-world experiments. A qualitative case study approach
                  is employed, focusing on Austrian Universities, to derive first-hand empirical insights
                  from early career researchers. It is widely assumed that young PhD or post-doc researchers
                  in the fields of climate change and sustainability science in Austria have received
                  undergraduate education, respectively training that qualifies them for conducting
                  participatory research with stakeholders. Such education is likely to have equipped
                  them with a distinctive inter-and transdisciplinary identity that also is motivating
                  them for solving grand environmental challenges [<a href="#R27">27</a>, <a href="#R28">28</a>]. However, reality looks different due to the following obstacles early career researchers
                  are facing. Young researchers’ perspectives of as well as their early experiences
                  with transdisciplinary research could have been disadvantaged by the characteristics
                  of modern academic environments itself. The latter has been recognized by previous
                  studies outside the context for Austria, which all imply a lack of investment in early
                  career researchers’ institutional environments, and their competences for conducting
                  inter-and transdisciplinary research; For example, it is unequivocal that today’s
                  pre- and post-doc students are facing a more competitive situation than their senior
                  colleagues did 20-30 years ago [<a href="#R29">29</a>]. And, publication pressure is real, especially at early-career stages. At the same
                  time, transdisciplinary research with stakeholders is increasingly demanded by funders;
                  a contradictory situation, since research involving stakeholders often translates
                  into more project coordination efforts and less time for working on scientific publications
                  [<a href="#R30">30</a>]. Doctoral students at the beginning of their academic careers sometimes lack the
                  necessary training and experience in conducting transdisciplinary research, which
                  may result in inadequately designed stakeholder processes [<a href="#R31">31</a>]. Moreover, transdisciplinary researchers are also confronted with a less developed
                  (compared to more established sciences) yet steadily growing transdisciplinary academic
                  publication culture [<a href="#R20">20</a>, <a href="#R32">32</a>]. This disciplinary publishing bias might explain why even some doctoral students
                  themselves rate inter-and transdisciplinary research as less rigorous than disciplinary
                  research [<a href="#R33">33</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e242">Early career climate change and sustainability research also is found to be impeded
                  by disciplinary doctoral programs offering little space for strengthening team-science
                  skills, or the development of skills to balance knowledge from science with knowledge
                  from society [<a href="#R34">34</a>]. As a matter of fact, such disciplinary graduate programs cannot be effective in
                  deepening learners’ skills for transdisciplinary research [<a href="#R35">35</a>]. In addition, young researchers in disciplinary doctoral programs may lack senior
                  guidance in identifying and writing for transdisciplinary journals. Previous research
                  also showed that an increasing share of early career researchers who have received
                  training in interdisciplinary master’s programs are challenged by mediating different
                  epistemologies, developing a rich methodological skill-set and implementing participatory
                  approaches at the same time. In other words, early-career practice in transdisciplinary
                  research is influenced by the dichotomy between high academic standards and the often-proclaimed
                  need for co-production of knowledge with stakeholders [<a href="#R31">31</a>],
                  
               </p>
               <p id="d1e253">Against this background, improved education on inter-and transdisciplinarity is widely
                  perceived as a general strategy to build early career researchers’ conceptual and
                  practical skills for stakeholder involvement. For example, learning in peer-groups
                  in which common experiences are shared could help early career researchers to reach
                  higher levels of reflection before, during and after inter-and transdisciplinary projects
                  [<a href="#R36">36</a>]. Furthermore, such learning could prepare them for avoiding practical stumbling
                  blocks that arise during stakeholder involvement [<a href="#R37">37</a>].

               <p id="d1e264">Previous studies, undertaken in other geographical contexts than Austria, have investigated
                  climate change and sustainability researchers’ perspectives of and experiences with
                  the paradigms of inter-and transdisciplinarity. The papers from Killion <i>et al.</i> [<a href="#R31">31</a>], Hein <i>et al.</i> [<a href="#R33">33</a>], Moore <i>et al.</i> [<a href="#R34">34</a>], Rivera-Ferre <i>et al.</i> [<a href="#R35">35</a>], Haider <i>et al.</i> [<a href="#R27">27</a>] and Jaeger-Erben <i>et al.</i> [<a href="#R28">28</a>] are illustrative examples of such explorative research efforts. Most of these studies
                  derived suggestions for improving non-curricular learning opportunities, career paths,
                  mentorship as well as doctoral training programmes for early career researchers. Suggestions
                  were based on survey data and collective workshop reflections. However, none of these
                  previous studies has explicitly taken a look back into the preceding bachelor’s or
                  master’s programmes of current doctoral or post-doc candidates. What is thus missing
                  in the existing literature are in-depth, first-hand insights into early career researchers’
                  levels of knowledge about stakeholder involvement that has been gained during their
                  undergraduate education. And, whether such educational experiences sufficiently prepared
                  them for conducting participatory research with stakeholders in their ongoing PhD
                  or post-doc research. What is also missing in the existing literature are peer-group
                  reflections about potential improvements to inter- and transdisciplinary undergraduate
                  education, since previous studies focused on research training during graduate years.
                  Many doctoral candidates start involving stakeholders in their doctoral research projects
                  right after their master’s education. We therefore hypothesize that next to graduate
                  research training, improving undergraduate education on inter-and transdisciplinary
                  research skills will be a particularly important leverage point for better preparing
                  upcoming researchers for science <i>together</i> with societal stakeholders [<a href="#R38">38</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e310">Addressing this gap in the peer-reviewed literature and by focussing on early career
                  researchers’ experiences with inter- and transdisciplinary education and research,
                  collected at a workshop in Vienna, this paper adds further empirical insights on inter-and
                  transdisciplinary climate change and sustainability research practice in Austria [<a href="#R36">36</a>]. Drawing from workshop participants’ reflections, this paper further aims at developing
                  general recommendations for the Austrian higher education system to better prepare
                  the next generation of climate change and sustainability researchers for stakeholder
                  involvement. Our geographical focus is Austria; however, we think that our general
                  findings are also useful for university teachers in other geographical contexts. The
                  following three central research questions were addressed by the reflective two-day
                  workshop for young scientists and will be answered in the remainder of this paper:

            <p id="d1e328">The Science Plan for climate research in Austria was realized in March 2018 and adopts
               an inter- and transdisciplinary research rationale. Initiated by the former Federal
               Ministry of Science and Research and further developed by the Climate Change Centre
               Austria (CCCA), it represents a five-to-seven-year research strategy for recent climate
               change and sustainability science for Austrian research institutions. The document
               leaves no doubt that barriers and opportunities inherent to mitigation, adaptation
               and sustainability transformations demand climate and sustainability researchers to
               open-up their knowledge systems and to develop awareness for the social relevance
               of their academic work. The corresponding message of the Science Plan to address important
               societal issues more effectively is as follows:
            </p>
            <p id="d1e330">
               <i>‘Global change in general and climate change in particular pose major scientific challenges…
                  In order to tackle the subsequent challenges, research of individual science disciplines
                  must be complemented by applying inter- and transdisciplinary approaches… Stakeholders
                  should therefore be involved in the research process from an early stage onward (co-design,
                  co-production, co-exploration)’</i> ([<a href="#R39">39</a>], p.&nbsp;3–4).
            </p>
            <p id="d1e338">The academic culture leading to this message is supposed to address senior researchers
               but is also believed to have influenced early career climate change and sustainability
               researchers at Austrian universities, including young professional who are working
               in related contexts as well. In April 2018, therefore the idea was born to give young
               climate change and sustainability researchers in Austria their own platform for sharing
               discussions on inter- and transdisciplinary research, for collective reflections about
               stakeholder involvement and for the eventual aim of co-designing joint research projects.
               To realise this idea, the first annual workshop for young climate change and sustainability
               researchers (including professionals) took place on November 18-19, 2018 in Vienna
               (see Figure <a href="#Fig1">1</a>). Under the headline <i>‘Participatory Approaches in Climate Change and Sustainability Research: Sharing Experiences,
                  Best Practices and Stumbling Blocks’</i>, the CCCA invited early career researchers and professionals (i.e. who were mainly
               pre-doc students and some post-docs) from all Austrian universities to apply for it.
               Participants were selected based on short e-mails stating their motivation for joining
               the workshop, their research background and a short curriculum vitae. Overall, sixteen
               early career climate change and sustainability researchers at PhD or postdoc level
               applied for the workshop but only fourteen were invited. Two applicants were not invited
               because they were Master students not doing research themselves and therefore did
               not meet the criteria for participation. The workshop started by improving participants’
               understanding of participatory approaches and practical collaboration with stakeholders.
               For this purpose, a lecture that included several case studies was given by a senior
               scientist working in the field of disaster risk reduction and participatory stakeholder
               processes. The workshop also aimed at creating reflexive space for deliberative dialogue
               among and mutual learning between participants [<a href="#R40">40</a>]. To stimulate discussions and exchange of early-career experiences, a round-table
               format was applied to invite workshop participants to share their perceived stumbling
               blocks and best practices when dealing with stakeholder involvement in their current
               research practice [<a href="#R41">41</a>]. During reflection phases, workshop participants reflected about the above-mentioned
               content and discussed their research projects of which all included stakeholders.
               Furthermore, they came up with several recommendations for improving higher education
               on inter- and transdisciplinary research in Austria.

            <p id="d1e362">Our basic methodological approach is a single case-study built around the above-mentioned
               early-career researchers’ workshop. This methodological approach was selected for
               two main reasons. Firstly, as a qualitative methodology a single-case study justifies
               an in-depth exploration of complex cases that cannot be sufficiently investigated
               by quantitative analysis since a well-structured sample would be needed [<a href="#R42">42</a>]. We faced major limitations to sampling in our case, because there is no reliable
               meta-information about the target population of early-career climate change and sustainability
               researchers in Austria. University websites alone are often not sufficient to consistently
               receive contact details of internal and external PhDs belonging to a certain research
               institute and it is unclear which scientific disciplines are conducting climate change
               and sustainability science in Austria. Secondly, an explorative single case-study
               for Austria seems justified since, to our knowledge, there are no previous empirical
               studies focussing on Austrian early career researchers’ perspectives on inter-and
               transdisciplinarity. A single-case study therefore could be an opportunity to gain
               first-hand and in-depth insights from the workshop participants on their educational
               and practical experiences with inter-and transdisciplinary knowledge production in
               Austria. We further evaluate whether the workshop provides an authentic learning environment
               to cultivate self-reflexivity among workshop participants. And, we derive recommendations
               for improving Austrian transdisciplinary university education [<a href="#R21">21</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e370">For data collection during and after the early career workshop, this study employed
               a pre-and post-test design. At the beginning of the workshop, thirteen participants
               were invited to respond to an ex-ante paper survey (one person did not participate
               in the workshop even though he/she was invited) of which twelve filled out the survey.
               All items included in the paper survey were open-ended questions, which should have
               given respondents the opportunity to examine their perspectives and their experiences.
               The ex-ante survey aimed at collecting background information on workshop participants’
               educational experiences and their motives for seeking participatory settings with
               stakeholders during their PhD and post-docs research. Moreover, the survey yielded
               early career researchers’ experiences and perspectives of best practices and common
               stumbling blocks when collaborating with stakeholders. Early career researchers also
               were asked to come up with some of their very own recommendations that could be undertaken
               after the workshop to improve participatory research training and higher education
               for inter-and transdisciplinary in Austria (see Table <a href="#Tab1">1</a>). To be able to complement the results of the ex-ante survey with direct observations,
               the authors documented collective reflections among workshop participants using flip
               charts and field notes.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e375">Within a week after the workshop, an online post-workshop survey was sent out to collect
               participants’ judgements of the effectiveness of the workshop. The post-workshop survey
               addressed participants’ self-assessments whether the collective reflection has been
               useful to improve personal knowledge regarding participatory approaches, and focussed
               on the workshops’ effectiveness in resolving (some) stumbling blocks related to stakeholder
               involvement (see Table <a href="#Tab2">2</a>).
            </p>
            <p id="d1e380">Both the data from the ex-ante and ex-post survey as well as data from collected reflections
               during the workshop were qualitatively analysed using thematic content analysis. Content
               analysis started by reading through workshop participants’ written answers, and then
               two authors independently coded the data from the survey into text-based categories.
               Those categories should reflect early career researchers’ perspective and experiences
               and were qualitatively compared after the coding procedure for inter-coder agreement.
               During the content analysis, the following steps were taken be each coder: (a) obtaining
               immersion with the written data (i.e. each author familiarised himself/herself with
               the data set by reading through the text), (b) identifying main meaning units in the
               original data (i.e. each author extracted thematic paragraphs that were common to
               most responses, (c) contrasting groups of similar responses, and (d) choosing text-based
               reference examples from the dataset [<a href="#R43">43</a>].

                  <!-- named anchor --></a><h3 class="section-title">4.1.- Workshop Participants and Their Inter-and Transdisciplinary Education Levels</h3>
               <p id="d1e532">The results show that most early career climate change and sustainability researchers
                  attending the workshop had academic backgrounds in interdisciplinary fields. Most
                  of them were trained in interdisciplinary bachelor’s or master’s programs, like environmental
                  sciences, geography, natural resources management, ecological engineering or human
                  and social ecology. Only two participants were trained in a more disciplinary field,
                  namely economics. Since those fields traditionally are open for transdisciplinarity,
                  every second workshop participant therefore knew about the potential added-value of
                  including societal stakeholders in climate change and sustainability research before
                  the workshop. Reasons for involving stakeholders into research practice that were
                  picked up by workshop participants during their undergraduate education were manifold.
                  For example, intense collaborations with stakeholders were argued to be effective
                  for societal change and also justified since <i>‘stakeholders could have the necessary knowledge for a given research question’</i> or simply because <i>‘climate change and sustainability research are dealing with real world problems and
                     therefore many people of society are affected’</i>. Moreover, the practice of inviting stakeholders into the research process could
                  <i>‘improve research due to a reality check’</i>, and <i>‘it ensures that decisions in planning are O.K. for people’</i>.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e546">Workshop participants also argued to have learned about several reasons for not involving
                  stakeholders in their research projects during their higher education. This is because
                  <i>‘stakeholder participation can also consume a lot of resources and may not lead to
                     the wanted results’</i>, or because collaboration between scientists and societal stakeholders is believed
                  to be <i>‘time-consuming’</i> and there is the risk that <i>‘results may not be reproducible’</i>.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e557">The analysis of workshop participants’ educational experiences also revealed that
                  besides gaining generic insights into inter- and transdisciplinarity, they also received
                  some more specific methodological training on how to engage with stakeholders before
                  enrolling in a PhD program or accepting a post-doc position. Workshop participants
                  either learned about participatory approaches like <i>‘agent-based modelling’</i> or <i>‘wider transdisciplinary theories’</i>. Other tools for stakeholder involvement and participatory research the participants
                  had experience with were applying <i>‘expert interviews’</i>, <i>‘focus groups’</i>, <i>‘role plays’</i>, <i>‘scenario analysis’</i>, <i>‘world-café’</i>, <i>‘workshops’</i> and even <i>‘climate narratives’</i>. Among workshop participants, there was consensus that especially <i>‘qualitative methods’</i> from the social sciences are particularly suitable for transdisciplinary research
                  endeavours.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e590">Some participants also reported that they have already collaborated with stakeholders
                  during their bachelor’s or master’s programmes. For example, participants did research
                  with <i>‘visitors of Austrian National Parks’</i>, <i>‘natural hazard managers’</i>, <i>‘farmers’</i>, <i>‘members of institutions, administration and municipalities’</i>, <i>‘teenagers’</i> and <i>‘decision-makers in the Austrian climate and energy sector’</i>. Different levels of science-society interactions were reached inasmuch some workshop
                  participants engaged with societal stakeholders during their bachelor’s or master’s
                  for <i>‘risk communication’</i> or just <i>‘polling’</i>. Others involved stakeholders in <i>‘design thinking processes’</i> or <i>‘participatory scenario analysis’</i>.

                  <!-- named anchor --></a><h3 class="section-title">4.2.- Workshop Participants’ Practical Experiences when Working with Societal Stakeholders</h3>
               <p id="d1e626">The analysis further showed that when becoming PhD students or post-docs the workshop
                  participants continued to conduct inter-and transdisciplinary research. They are recently
                  contributing to three main scientific fields: <i>climate change research</i> (i.e. focusing on management, communication/education and behaviour); <i>flood risk research</i> (i.e. focusing on management, communication and behaviour); and <i>disaster risk reduction</i> (i.e. focusing on vulnerability, communication, and management). Other fields were
                  land-use dynamics (i.e. focusing on scenario building), <i>sustainability science</i> (i.e. focusing on the Anthropocene age), <i>responsible research and innovation, de-growth studies and feminist methodologies</i>.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e643">Across all identified research fields, most workshop participants claimed that they
                  would feel increasingly required to develop integrative skills as well as competencies
                  in risk and science communication. They also argued that more knowledge on and methodological
                  know-how for participatory settings could be useful to better navigate transdisciplinary
                  research and its outcomes. Two statements reflect those perspectives:
               </p>
               <p id="d1e645">Respondent A: <i>‘I think it is good to know participatory toolboxes (methodological approaches), that
                     one can relate to’</i>.
                  Respondent B: <i>‘For researchers in climate change adaptation, it is crucial to know different theories
                     whether stakeholders can contribute to a research problem, or not’</i>.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e653">Workshop participants also argued that working with stakeholders would require ongoing
                  learning and that practical experience is highly valued by their institutions and
                  teams. Two additional statements reflect their views:
               </p>
               <p id="d1e655">Respondent C: <i>‘Practical experience helps to understand and facilitate the process of working with
                     people’</i>.
                  Respondent D: <i>‘Stakeholder participation requires a lot of practice and is, to some, degree learning
                     by doing. In my opinion, any research that tries to identify solutions to societal
                     challenges should involve and attract stakeholders’</i>.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e663">The results on research experiences indicated that workshop participants reach different
                  levels of engagement when working with stakeholders in their research projects. These
                  phases of engagement are referred to as (1) information, (2) consultation, (3) collaboration
                  and (4) empowerment [<a href="#R44">44</a>]. Most participants claimed that, in their research projects, they usually inform,
                  consult and collaborate with stakeholders under a common research goal. Just one participant
                  claimed that stakeholders would be empowered through his or her research project.
                  Even as deep engagement between researchers and stakeholders was perceived as highly
                  important it was also recognised that <i>‘empowerment is difficult to measure’</i>.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e671">Participatory tools used by workshop participants during their research projects before
                  the workshop mainly referred to conventional project management tools and some qualitative
                  research methods. For example, <i>‘workshop settings’</i> or <i>‘role plays’</i> were undertaken to establish collaboration, and <i>‘design thinking’</i> as well as <i>‘serious games’</i> were used for co-production of knowledge or policy options. Participants applied
                  <i>‘semi-structured interviews’</i>, <i>‘surveys’</i> and <i>‘thematic mapping’</i> in efforts to consult stakeholders. In terms of epistemological theories for communication
                  with stakeholders, <i>‘constructivism’</i> was perceived as an effective approach or theory for participatory research endeavours.
                  
               </p>
               <p id="d1e698">The results of this category also show that even though most workshop participants
                  have learned about inter-and transdisciplinarity during their undergraduate years
                  they still face several stumbling blocks when conducting their postgraduate inter-and
                  transdisciplinary climate change and sustainability research. A typical stumbling
                  block was finding a common language with stakeholders for adequately transitioning
                  scientific content to societal contexts. Establishing communication routines to express
                  the societal relevance of inter- and transdisciplinary research outcomes was a reported
                  stumbling block as well. Another issue was building trust between researchers and
                  stakeholders. Two statements reflect this perspective:
               </p>
               <p id="d1e700">Respondent E: <i>‘Sometimes, it is hard to establish initial trust with stakeholders’</i>.
                  Respondent F: <i>‘Translating research results into a language that is understandable to the public
                     is a challenge itself. Despite uncertainties in scientific results, decision-makers
                     need clear messages for their decisions’</i>.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e708">As a second category of stumbling-blocks reported by workshop participants deals with
                  project management and grant writing. Two statements are given below:
               </p>
               <p id="d1e711">Respondent G: <i>‘Identifying dates and arranging meetings with stakeholders – almost 24/7 project
                     management’</i>.
                  Respondent H: <i>‘For a research proposal, I failed to describe exchange between stakeholders and researchers
                     robustly enough’</i>.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e719">The workshop participants recognised several benefits of inter- and transdisciplinary
                  research for their current research projects, for example <i>‘triggering mutual learning among academic and non-academic actors’</i>, <i>‘creating acceptance of research-led solutions’</i> and <i>‘overcoming a reductionist view’</i> of narrowly focused research attempts. Nevertheless, they also were concerned with
                  some other challenges related to the analysis and dissemination of transdisciplinary
                  processes, like <i>‘finding adequate transdisciplinary journals’</i> and <i>‘arguing for a certain participatory method or theory in front of senior colleagues’</i>. Problems like <i>‘testing the effectiveness of transdisciplinary research by intersubjective means’</i> and <i>‘gaining the acceptance from non-transdisciplinary colleagues’</i> were reported as well.

               <p id="d1e746">After participating in the early career workshop, some workshop participants indicated
                  that they have gained new knowledge related to participatory approaches and argued
                  to have deepened their understanding of collaboration with societal stakeholders.
                  More specifically, workshop participants claimed to have learned about new methods
                  to engage with different types of stakeholders, and were becoming more aware of which
                  factors could limit a transdisciplinary research design. One statement is given below:
               </p>
               <p id="d1e748">Respondent I: <i>‘I gained the insight that there is a broad range of different tools to involve stakeholders
                     within studies. I also gained the insight that prior to the selection of stakeholders,
                     an analysis should be conducted to better know your audience and the types of benefits
                     that stakeholders can bring into research projects. I learned that the process from
                     stakeholder identification to involvement towards co-production of research outcomes
                     should be organized as systematically and rigor as possible’</i>.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e753">For many participants, the workshop represented a first opportunity to jointly discuss
                  the challenges related to stakeholder involvement in their research projects, however
                  it was also mentioned that a workshop never can replace learning from personally practising
                  research. One such statement is given below:
               </p>
               <p id="d1e755">Respondent J: <i>‘The workshop showed that there are some common mistakes in implementing participatory
                     processes. The best way to learn and resolve stumbling blocks, however, is through
                     hands-on, practical experience’</i>.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e760">The workshop was also reported to have been effective in motivating participants to
                  apply participatory research approaches in the future. At the same time, it was reported
                  that a more profound understanding of the different levels of engagement with stakeholders
                  is acquired to really lead to transformational change for sustainability in wider
                  society. Three reflective statements from workshop participants are as follows:
               </p>
               <p id="d1e762">Respondent K: <i>‘This survey is a good way to reflect about the workshop. The workshop helped me to
                     be more explicit about aims and methods in stakeholder involvement, and I will look
                     more deeply in different case studies on participatory approaches’</i>.
                  Respondent L: <i>‘I will respect new insights that I gained during the workshop in my PhD thesis. I
                     also think that these insights will help me writing proposals dealing with stakeholder
                     involvement’</i>.
                  Respondent M: <i>‘I am more careful to reflect whether I should integrate stakeholders within my project
                     or not. This should be done to avoid stakeholder fatigue and it should be critically
                     evaluated whether participation with stakeholders creates added value or not’</i>.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e773">Despite workshop participants reported to have experienced learning outcomes due to
                  the workshop, it is important to note that some participants claimed that it did not
                  resolve all stumbling blocks or confusions related to collaboration with stakeholders
                  or inter- and transdisciplinary climate change and sustainability research. One statement

                  Research in Austria
               </h3>
               <p id="d1e783">During the workshop, workshop participants reflected upon how to improve current inter-
                  and transdisciplinary university education, respectively how to improve participatory
                  research training for stakeholder involvement in Austria. They came up with several
                  transformative suggestions that are relevant to several bachelor’s and master’s programmes
                  at Austrian universities. The identified recommendations are as follows:
               </p>
               <p id="d1e785">
                  <b>• Lectures on participatory approaches</b> should provide university students in the fields of climate change and sustainability
                  sciences with <i>‘basic introductions to qualitative research, theories in social sciences and stakeholder
                     engagement’</i>.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e793">
                  <b>• Excursions</b> in which university students could <i>‘develop and train participatory methods together with stakeholders and fellow students’</i>.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e801">
                  <b>• Hands-on courses</b> in which <i>‘one can design and implement participatory tools by his or her own’</i> and <i>‘in-depth workshops’</i> on stakeholder involvement, both embedded in existing university curricula, should
                  <i>‘offer an extensive overview of possible tools and methods’</i>.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e815">
                  <b>• Inter-and transdisciplinary mini-projects</b> on stakeholder involvement should be offered in higher education already <i>‘during undergraduate years’</i> since <i>‘experience beats everything’</i>.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e826">
                  <b>• Toolkits</b> on <i>‘how to work with stakeholders’</i> should be discussed and employed during university courses and in <i>‘lecture notes’</i>.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e837">It was further tried to embed the potential improvements recommended by workshop participants
                  into a larger context using the approach from Killion <i>et al.</i> [<a href="#R31">31</a>] (see Figure <a href="#Fig2">2</a>). Like them we plotted each single measure against its assumed implementation effort
                  to inform department leaders, deans of studies, lectures, and other scientific professionals
                  who are usually responsible for developing higher education. We also evaluated whether
                  each measure could be aligned with existing science curricular in the Austrian university
                  system or not. The results of this reflective process suggest that all measures could
                  be theoretically applied, but would have different outcomes to learners. For example,
                  it should be possible for study committees and lectures to develop and integrate thematic
                  lectures on inter-and transdisciplinarity into existing bachelor’s and master’s programmes
                  that set out to prepare students for solving climate change and sustainability issues.
                  Such conceptual lectures could be used to elaborate on social science theories on
                  communication and/or science-society collaborations as well to introduce technical
                  toolkits showcasing frameworks and methods and its specific advantages and disadvantages
                  for participatory research with stakeholders. Workshop participants however claimed
                  that transdisciplinarity must also be personally experienced and therefore they recommended
                  that coming generations of climate change and sustainability researchers in Austria
                  could benefit from authentic learning in excursions, hands-on courses and mini-projects
                  with stakeholders during their undergraduate education. It is further believed that
                  an improved transdisciplinary education not only could lead to scientific excellence
                  in the long-term but could also reduce trivial but often experienced stumbling-blocks
                  when collaborating with societal stakeholders. Referring to practical stumbling-blocks,
                  workshop participants reflected on each measure’s potential for preparing early career
                  researchers for more successful inter-and transdisciplinary grant-writing, sound project
                  management and more flexible communication skills. The latter is important for translating
                  inter-and transdisciplinary research into real-life management contexts.

            <p id="d1e861">This paper set out to qualitatively examine twelve early career climate change and
               sustainability researchers’ (and young professionals’) educational and practical experiences
               in conducting participatory research with stakeholders in the context of Austria.
               Thematic coding of survey data and documented workshop reflections showed that participants
               had received undergraduate education on inter-and transdisciplinarity and had practical
               experiences before choosing to work with stakeholders in their recent PhD/post-doc
               projects. Nevertheless, several stumbling-blocks are found to complicate their every-day
               collaboration with stakeholders and the workshop was perceived as a good opportunity
               to engage in peer discussion and practice self-reflexivity. Reflections during the
               workshop resulted in several recommendations for alternative learning concepts to
               improve current inter-and transdisciplinary education at Austrian universities.

               <p id="d1e866">Results of this study confirm previous research insights derived from examining other
                  contexts than Austria. For example, findings from Haider <i>et al.</i>, who surveyed 325 early career sustainability scientists in the broader network of
                  resilience research and practice during the Resilience 2014 conference in Montpelier,
                  France, also apply to early career climate change and sustainability researchers in
                  Austria: (a) workshop participants mainly were trained in interdisciplinary bachelor’s
                  or master’s programmes and (b) participants’ practical experiences with stakeholders
                  underline that ‘methodological groundedness’ (i.e. the ability of a researcher to
                  understand and put a certain transdisciplinary method into practice) as well as ‘epistemic
                  agility’ (i.e. the ability of a researcher to understand claims about through and
                  knowledge outside academia) are understood as key guiding principles for successful
                  participatory research with stakeholders ([<a href="#R27">27</a>], p.&nbsp;197).
               </p>
               <p id="d1e874">Our results also agree with Killion <i>et al.</i> [<a href="#R31">31</a>] inasmuch workshop participants reported that low levels of team-science skills and
                  inappropriate project management are likely to raise practical difficulties for doctoral
                  students during stakeholder involvement. Like Killion <i>et al.</i> [<a href="#R31">31</a>] we conclude that as more collaboration with stakeholders is expected by decision-makers,
                  funders or senior colleagues, the more care must be given to systematically prepare
                  pre-doc and post-doc researchers for establishing robust transdisciplinary platforms
                  [<a href="#R45">45</a>, <a href="#R46">46</a>]. This means that science networks in Austria and other countries are recommended
                  to provide sufficient institutional support for developing the next generation of
                  inter- and transdisciplinary researchers. This should be undertaken not only through
                  increased levels of funding [<a href="#R47">47</a>], but also by offering continuous learning opportunities that equip the next generation
                  of scholars with a deep understanding of agency-based approaches and public engagement
                  [<a href="#R48">48</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e901">Going beyond the existing literature by assessing the workshop participants’ previous
                  undergraduate education experiences, our results show that most workshop participants
                  were knowledgeable about state-of-the-art methods in participatory research, like
                  world-cafés or stakeholder discussions in focus groups, already prior to their PhD
                  or post-doc projects. Some even reported to use facilitation tools like design thinking
                  in their current research activities. None of the workshop participants however indicated
                  to have prior knowledge or practical experience with methods for real-life transdisciplinary
                  experimentation, like real-world laboratories [<a href="#R49">49</a>], the future search conference method or other tools relevant for facilitating sustainable
                  outcomes among stakeholder groups. Methodological guidance can be found in the toolkit
                  compendium of the scientific journal <i>GAIA-Ecological Perspectives for Science and Society</i> [<a href="#R50">50</a>]. We think that limited awareness of tools useful to transdisciplinary experimentation
                  is problematic because it implies that ways to effective knowledge integration, which
                  is the process by which transdisciplinary research combines scientific outcomes and
                  non-academic knowledge to trigger real-life solutions [<a href="#R51">51</a>], are unknown to young climate change and sustainability researchers. A weak understanding
                  of strategies to re-integrate outcomes of transdisciplinary research into societal
                  practice [<a href="#R20">20</a>] could also explain why most participants were sceptical whether their PhD or post-doc
                  research is effective in empowering stakeholders for sustainability.

                  <!-- named anchor --></a><h3 class="section-title">5.2.- Improving Inter- and Transdisciplinary University Education in Austria</h3>
               <p id="d1e921">One of the most important findings of this case-study is that interdisciplinary bachelor’s
                  or master’s programs in Austria do not necessarily prepare early career climate change
                  and sustainability researchers with the conceptual knowledge as well as management
                  skills for stakeholder involvement. Degrees in environmental sciences or human and
                  social ecology may prepare students for taking more holistic approaches to problem
                  solving and may strengthen their systems thinking skills [<a href="#R52">52</a>]. It is however argued that this is not enough for solving challenges in transdisciplinary
                  research, like dealing with different epistemological realities, being flexible in
                  co-production of knowledge or gaining higher levels of self-reflexivity for critically
                  evaluating one owns transdisciplinary research [<a href="#R21">21</a>]. Most workshop participants have directly entered the inter-and transdisciplinary
                  arena after their graduation. Participatory research trainings sporadically taken
                  during the first and second years of the PhD therefore might not be the only optimal
                  strategy to foster early career researchers’ participatory research competences, especially
                  if average time of institutional employment during PhD stage in Austria is limited
                  to three years. Hence it is proposed that new and innovative pedagogic strategies
                  applied already during bachelor’s or master’s programmes could be a promising educational
                  investment for sustainable development in Austria; these might include several of
                  our workshop participants’ recommendations, like offering inter- and transdisciplinary
                  mini-projects or hands-on courses. In such learning activities, learners should be
                  allowed to freely experiment with participatory approaches, and such undergraduate
                  teachings may also make a meaningful contribution to the above-mentioned science plan
                  [<a href="#R39">39</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e932">Involving societal stakeholders into such transdisciplinary learning activities is
                  central, however benefits must be offered by Universities to keep societal actors
                  engaged over longer periods of time. We suggest, for example, providing stakeholders
                  free access to scientific journals as well as highlighting throughout the process
                  the practical relevance of co-produced research results for the stakeholders’ fields
                  of activity. Mainstreaming transdisciplinarity into the academic system is central
                  [<a href="#R53">53</a>] and this also was discussed during the early career workshop.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e937">Transdisciplinary lectures in current science curricula therefore could be used to
                  make undergraduate students more familiar with widely accepted stakeholder frameworks
                  [<a href="#R54">54</a>, <a href="#R55">55</a>], and toolkits for managing participatory research processes. Toolkits like the ones
                  of Welp <i>et al.</i> [<a href="#R22">22</a>] or Wittmayer and Hölscher [<a href="#R56">56</a>] could become common knowledge for upcoming inter-and transdisciplinary climate change
                  and sustainability researchers. Overall, our suggestions for improving higher education
                  in Austria were found to be very well in line with Wittmayer and Schäpke [<a href="#R57">57</a>], who argued that transdisciplinary cooperation should already be part of education
                  programs to enable young researchers to deal with the challenges ahead.

                  Workshop
               </h3>
               <p id="d1e961">Interestingly, the workshop not only was reported to be effective in providing new
                  knowledge but also to foster peer-group discussion. It also seemed to have strengthened
                  early career researchers’ critical thinking about inter-and transdisciplinarity. Several
                  reference examples support this claim. Mutual learning between workshop participants
                  also included discussions between those researchers who published a transdisciplinary
                  paper before and others who were interested to do so. These workshops therefore can
                  be a place in sharing knowledge on, and publishing experiences in, the steadily emerging
                  peer-reviewed academic journals that do foster transdisciplinary research, for example
                  <i>Ecology and Society, GAIA, One Earth, Sustainability Science, Ambio and others</i> [<a href="#R58">58</a>]. What must be critically admitted however is that the workshop design characterized
                  by a short initial lecture given by a senior researcher and the strong emphasis on
                  group reflections was not fully effective in resolving workshop participants’ methodological
                  stumbling-blocks with stakeholder involvement. For better methodical training a more
                  interactive workshop design therefore must be chosen in which methods are tested and/or
                  in which not only senior researcher but also stakeholders could be invited. Ideally,
                  such stakeholders should have collaborated in transdisciplinary projects before and
                  should be willing to share their lessons learned. Despite this limitation, the workshop
                  indicates that there is a largely unexploited interest among early career climate
                  change and sustainability researchers in Austria to reach rigorousness in participatory
                  research with societal stakeholders. Since this interest fits well into the scope
                  of the above-mentioned science plan (see background chapter), the CCCA and similar
                  national science consortia are encouraged to build on this common interest by promoting
                  and holding early career workshops on a regular basis. Furthermore, they are encouraged
                  to develop their own forms of innovative training for inter-and transdisciplinary
                  research [<a href="#R39">39</a>]. Examples of mutual learning opportunities that are also relevant to the Austrian
                  context are the Postdoc Academy for Transformational Leadership [<a href="#R59">59</a>], the td Academy [<a href="#R60">60</a>] or the TD summer school from the Leuphana University, Germany [<a href="#R61">61</a>].

               <p id="d1e985">Several limitations of this study are acknowledged. Firstly, the study’s sample size
                  (N=12) is small and therefore we avoid a generalization of our results beyond the
                  national context of Austria. This country approach to generalization is in line with
                  similar studies also focussing on early career challenges related to transdisciplinary
                  sustainability research, for example Killion <i>et al.</i> [<a href="#R31">31</a>] (N=26, United States of America) or Jaeger-Erben <i>et al.</i> [<a href="#R28">28</a>] (N=12, Germany). Small sample sizes per se are not problematic to single-case study
                  research inasmuch they can be instructive to complex social phenomena [<a href="#R42">42</a>, <a href="#R62">62</a>]. However, we also understand that our results and recommendations should be interpreted
                  with caution inasmuch they are not fully representative of all early career climate
                  change and sustainability scientists in Austria. We therefore encourage other scholars
                  to scale up our workshop approach and to invite a larger number of early career researchers
                  to such events. But at the same time, we also note that such future research could
                  learn from our qualitative insights since they have pilot-study character. The second
                  limitation relates to the selection of workshop participants. Since participants had
                  to apply for the workshop, the sample of course does not account for other PhD or
                  post-doc researchers in the fields of climate change and sustainability who probably
                  were not interested, had not time to join the event or simply were not informed about
                  the workshop. Furthermore, the qualitative analysis of the workshop’s effectiveness
                  only is based on workshop participants’ self-assessment. Self-reported learning of
                  course is subjective and future works are therefore recommended to explore whether
                  participants had tested strategies from the reflective workshop in their early career
                  research practice more objectively.

            <p id="d1e1009">This case study has provided in-depth insight into Austrian early career climate change
               and sustainability researchers’ educational and practical experiences when working
               with societal stakeholders in their inter- and transdisciplinary PhD or post-doc projects.
               Results confirm those of previous international studies on early career researchers
               and suggest that mutual learning among peers and senior researchers about stakeholder
               involvement, e.g. in the form of focused workshops, can have several positive effects.
               Workshop participants expand their knowledge, reflect more critically about transdisciplinary
               research designs, and simply can build a professional network. In addition, we find
               that graduate research training should not be perceived as the only strategy to resolve
               conceptual and practical stumbling-blocks related to participatory research with societal
               stakeholders. One of our main conclusions is that early career researchers would benefit
               substantially if their preceding bachelor’s and master’s programmes in the fields
               of climate change and sustainability sciences would incorporate more practice-oriented
               transdisciplinary learning activities. This includes, amongst others, more elaborate
               teaching techniques on how to re-integrate transdisciplinary research outcomes back
               into society.
