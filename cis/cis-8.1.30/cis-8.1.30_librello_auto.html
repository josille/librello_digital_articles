                                 and global change posing existential risks for mankind. To overcome the policy implementation
                                 gap in practice both collective and transformative actions for sustainability involving
                                 science, policy and society are urgently needed. In the realms of science, this relates
                                 to taking inter-and transdisciplinary research approaches to foster exchange and co-designing
                                 policy options between researcher, decision-makers and other societal stakeholders;
                                 however, such collaboration is often limited by time, funding and complexity constrains.
                                 This paper recognises that particularly early career climate change and sustainability
                                 researchers are exposed to both the claim for and practical challenges of inter- and
                                 transdisciplinarity. For a first qualitative investigation of Austrian early career
                                 researchers’ preparedness for conducting participatory research with societal stakeholders,
                                 this study examines perspectives of twelve early career researchers participating
                                 in a young scientists' workshop.   Using a pre-post survey and analysing data by content,
                                 our findings indicate that workshop participants have to manage stakeholder processes
                                 directly after graduation and, due to a lack of methodological training, only use
                                 a small fraction of existing social science methods and participatory settings for
                                 stakeholder collaboration. To support other early career researchers and future students
                                 in Austria in developing strong inter-and transdisciplinary research skills, we highlight
                                 the added-value of integrating hands-on workshops with societal stakeholders, regular
                                 exchange of lessons learned and transdisciplinary lectures into university education.
                                 Offering more practice-oriented transdisciplinary learning activities during undergraduate
                                 education, like excursions and mini-projects in which students can develop and train
                                 participatory methods together with stakeholders under guidance, is believed to be
                                 a fruitful strategy in this context.</span></div>

                                 planet’s biosphere. For example, plastic is found to pollute the Pacific Ocean [<a href="#R5">5</a>], and ongoing land-use changes could transform protected areas and ecosystems [<a href="#R6">6</a>].

                                       three to four decades, there remain apparently unbridgeable gaps between knowledge,
                                       awareness and action for sustainability. For example, scientific evidence on anthropogenic
                                       climate change did so far not translate into sufficient societal actions in line with
                                       the Paris Agreement [<a href="#R11">11</a>]. Due to complexity and interconnectedness many risks of global environmental change
                                       are poorly understood and traditional research has been fond not effective enough
                                       in taking the perceptions of societal actors into perspective [<a href="#R12">12</a>]. To overcome this limitation to scientific knowledge production, inter- and transdisciplinary

                                       [<a href="#R18">18</a>, <a href="#R19">19</a>, <a href="#R20">20</a>]; however, the societal outcomes of participatory research with stakeholders strongly
                                       depends on researchers’ understanding of and competences for civic engagement. Prominent
                                       stumbling-blocks for example are researchers’ poorly developed abilities to take multifaceted
                                       approaches and their skills in mediating between diverging epistemological positions
                                       [<a href="#R21">21</a>].

                                    <p id="d1e195">Challenges to collaboration with stakeholders across a spectrum from getting societal
                                       insights, preferences and opinions all the way to longer-term involvement in experimentation
                                       (e.g. urban living labs) also could arise from language differences [<a href="#R22">22</a>]. Moreover, science-society collaborations require researchers to be experienced
                                       in managing group processes. Transdisciplinary endeavours for sustainability are further
                                       complicated by uncertainty about the future [<a href="#R23">23</a>], conflicting expectations between stakeholders and researchers [<a href="#R24">24</a>], issues related to scientific credibility and impact evaluation [<a href="#R25">25</a>, <a href="#R26">26</a>]. The manifold practical challenges to successful stakeholder involvement suggest
                                       that better preparing present and future scholars for inter-and transdisciplinarity
                                       should be of uttermost importance for the scientific community.

                                    </h3>
                                    <p id="d1e215">In this paper, we focus on early career climate change and sustainability researchers
                                       (including early professionals) and their previous and ongoing education on transdisciplinary
                                       stakeholder involvement. We also study their practical experiences when collaborating
                                       with stakeholders in research practice across the continuum from collecting societal
                                       insights to the involvement in real-world experiments. A qualitative case study approach
                                       is employed, focusing on Austrian Universities, to derive first-hand empirical insights
                                       from early career researchers. It is widely assumed that young PhD or post-doc researchers
                                       in the fields of climate change and sustainability science in Austria have received
                                       undergraduate education, respectively training that qualifies them for conducting
                                       participatory research with stakeholders. Such education is likely to have equipped
                                       them with a distinctive inter-and transdisciplinary identity that also is motivating
                                       them for solving grand environmental challenges [<a href="#R27">27</a>, <a href="#R28">28</a>]. However, reality looks different due to the following obstacles early career researchers
                                       are facing. Young researchers’ perspectives of as well as their early experiences
                                       with transdisciplinary research could have been disadvantaged by the characteristics
                                       of modern academic environments itself. The latter has been recognized by previous
                                       studies outside the context for Austria, which all imply a lack of investment in early
                                       career researchers’ institutional environments, and their competences for conducting
                                       inter-and transdisciplinary research; For example, it is unequivocal that today’s
                                       pre- and post-doc students are facing a more competitive situation than their senior
                                       colleagues did 20-30 years ago [<a href="#R29">29</a>]. And, publication pressure is real, especially at early-career stages. At the same
                                       time, transdisciplinary research with stakeholders is increasingly demanded by funders;
                                       a contradictory situation, since research involving stakeholders often translates
                                       into more project coordination efforts and less time for working on scientific publications
                                       [<a href="#R30">30</a>]. Doctoral students at the beginning of their academic careers sometimes lack the
                                       necessary training and experience in conducting transdisciplinary research, which
                                       may result in inadequately designed stakeholder processes [<a href="#R31">31</a>]. Moreover, transdisciplinary researchers are also confronted with a less developed
                                       (compared to more established sciences) yet steadily growing transdisciplinary academic
                                       publication culture [<a href="#R20">20</a>, <a href="#R32">32</a>]. This disciplinary publishing bias might explain why even some doctoral students
                                       themselves rate inter-and transdisciplinary research as less rigorous than disciplinary
                                       research [<a href="#R33">33</a>].
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e242">Early career climate change and sustainability research also is found to be impeded
                                       by disciplinary doctoral programs offering little space for strengthening team-science
                                       skills, or the development of skills to balance knowledge from science with knowledge
                                       from society [<a href="#R34">34</a>]. As a matter of fact, such disciplinary graduate programs cannot be effective in
                                       deepening learners’ skills for transdisciplinary research [<a href="#R35">35</a>]. In addition, young researchers in disciplinary doctoral programs may lack senior
                                       guidance in identifying and writing for transdisciplinary journals. Previous research
                                       also showed that an increasing share of early career researchers who have received
                                       training in interdisciplinary master’s programs are challenged by mediating different
                                       epistemologies, developing a rich methodological skill-set and implementing participatory
                                       approaches at the same time. In other words, early-career practice in transdisciplinary
                                       research is influenced by the dichotomy between high academic standards and the often-proclaimed
                                       need for co-production of knowledge with stakeholders [<a href="#R31">31</a>],
                                       
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e253">Against this background, improved education on inter-and transdisciplinarity is widely
                                       perceived as a general strategy to build early career researchers’ conceptual and
                                       practical skills for stakeholder involvement. For example, learning in peer-groups
                                       in which common experiences are shared could help early career researchers to reach
                                       higher levels of reflection before, during and after inter-and transdisciplinary projects
                                       [<a href="#R36">36</a>]. Furthermore, such learning could prepare them for avoiding practical stumbling
                                       blocks that arise during stakeholder involvement [<a href="#R37">37</a>].

                                    <p id="d1e264">Previous studies, undertaken in other geographical contexts than Austria, have investigated
                                       climate change and sustainability researchers’ perspectives of and experiences with
                                       the paradigms of inter-and transdisciplinarity. The papers from Killion <i>et al.</i> [<a href="#R31">31</a>], Hein <i>et al.</i> [<a href="#R33">33</a>], Moore <i>et al.</i> [<a href="#R34">34</a>], Rivera-Ferre <i>et al.</i> [<a href="#R35">35</a>], Haider <i>et al.</i> [<a href="#R27">27</a>] and Jaeger-Erben <i>et al.</i> [<a href="#R28">28</a>] are illustrative examples of such explorative research efforts. Most of these studies
                                       derived suggestions for improving non-curricular learning opportunities, career paths,
                                       mentorship as well as doctoral training programmes for early career researchers. Suggestions
                                       were based on survey data and collective workshop reflections. However, none of these
                                       previous studies has explicitly taken a look back into the preceding bachelor’s or
                                       master’s programmes of current doctoral or post-doc candidates. What is thus missing
                                       in the existing literature are in-depth, first-hand insights into early career researchers’
                                       levels of knowledge about stakeholder involvement that has been gained during their
                                       undergraduate education. And, whether such educational experiences sufficiently prepared
                                       them for conducting participatory research with stakeholders in their ongoing PhD
                                       or post-doc research. What is also missing in the existing literature are peer-group
                                       reflections about potential improvements to inter- and transdisciplinary undergraduate
                                       education, since previous studies focused on research training during graduate years.
                                       Many doctoral candidates start involving stakeholders in their doctoral research projects
                                       right after their master’s education. We therefore hypothesize that next to graduate
                                       research training, improving undergraduate education on inter-and transdisciplinary
                                       research skills will be a particularly important leverage point for better preparing
                                       upcoming researchers for science <i>together</i> with societal stakeholders [<a href="#R38">38</a>].

                              <p id="d1e328">The Science Plan for climate research in Austria was realized in March 2018 and adopts
                                 an inter- and transdisciplinary research rationale. Initiated by the former Federal
                                 Ministry of Science and Research and further developed by the Climate Change Centre
                                 Austria (CCCA), it represents a five-to-seven-year research strategy for recent climate
                                 change and sustainability science for Austrian research institutions. The document
                                 leaves no doubt that barriers and opportunities inherent to mitigation, adaptation
                                 and sustainability transformations demand climate and sustainability researchers to
                                 open-up their knowledge systems and to develop awareness for the social relevance
                                 of their academic work. The corresponding message of the Science Plan to address important
                                 societal issues more effectively is as follows:
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e330"><i>‘Global change in general and climate change in particular pose major scientific challenges…
                                    In order to tackle the subsequent challenges, research of individual science disciplines
                                    must be complemented by applying inter- and transdisciplinary approaches… Stakeholders
                                    should therefore be involved in the research process from an early stage onward (co-design,

                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e337">The academic culture leading to this message is supposed to address senior researchers
                                 but is also believed to have influenced early career climate change and sustainability
                                 researchers at Austrian universities, including young professional who are working
                                 in related contexts as well. In April 2018, therefore the idea was born to give young
                                 climate change and sustainability researchers in Austria their own platform for sharing
                                 discussions on inter- and transdisciplinary research, for collective reflections about
                                 stakeholder involvement and for the eventual aim of co-designing joint research projects.
                                 To realise this idea, the first annual workshop for young climate change and sustainability
                                 researchers (including professionals) took place on November 18-19, 2018 in Vienna
                                 (see Figure <a href="#Fig1">1</a>). Under the headline <i>‘Participatory Approaches in Climate Change and Sustainability Research: Sharing Experiences,
                                    Best Practices and Stumbling Blocks’</i>, the CCCA invited early career researchers and professionals (i.e. who were mainly
                                 pre-doc students and some post-docs) from all Austrian universities to apply for it.
                                 Participants were selected based on short e-mails stating their motivation for joining
                                 the workshop, their research background and a short curriculum vitae. Overall, sixteen
                                 early career climate change and sustainability researchers at PhD or postdoc level
                                 applied for the workshop but only fourteen were invited. Two applicants were not invited
                                 because they were Master students not doing research themselves and therefore did
                                 not meet the criteria for participation. The workshop started by improving participants’
                                 understanding of participatory approaches and practical collaboration with stakeholders.
                                 For this purpose, a lecture that included several case studies was given by a senior
                                 scientist working in the field of disaster risk reduction and participatory stakeholder
                                 processes. The workshop also aimed at creating reflexive space for deliberative dialogue
                                 among and mutual learning between participants [<a href="#R40">40</a>]. To stimulate discussions and exchange of early-career experiences, a round-table
                                 format was applied to invite workshop participants to share their perceived stumbling
                                 blocks and best practices when dealing with stakeholder involvement in their current
                                 research practice [<a href="#R41">41</a>]. During reflection phases, workshop participants reflected about the above-mentioned
                                 content and discussed their research projects of which all included stakeholders.
                                 Furthermore, they came up with several recommendations for improving higher education
                                 on inter- and transdisciplinary research in Austria.

                              <p id="d1e361">Our basic methodological approach is a single case-study built around the above-mentioned
                                 early-career researchers’ workshop. This methodological approach was selected for
                                 two main reasons. Firstly, as a qualitative methodology a single-case study justifies
                                 an in-depth exploration of complex cases that cannot be sufficiently investigated
                                 by quantitative analysis since a well-structured sample would be needed [<a href="#R42">42</a>]. We faced major limitations to sampling in our case, because there is no reliable
                                 meta-information about the target population of early-career climate change and sustainability
                                 researchers in Austria. University websites alone are often not sufficient to consistently
                                 receive contact details of internal and external PhDs belonging to a certain research
                                 institute and it is unclear which scientific disciplines are conducting climate change
                                 and sustainability science in Austria. Secondly, an explorative single case-study
                                 for Austria seems justified since, to our knowledge, there are no previous empirical
                                 studies focussing on Austrian early career researchers’ perspectives on inter-and
                                 transdisciplinarity. A single-case study therefore could be an opportunity to gain
                                 first-hand and in-depth insights from the workshop participants on their educational
                                 and practical experiences with inter-and transdisciplinary knowledge production in
                                 Austria. We further evaluate whether the workshop provides an authentic learning environment
                                 to cultivate self-reflexivity among workshop participants. And, we derive recommendations
                                 for improving Austrian transdisciplinary university education [<a href="#R21">21</a>].

                              <p id="d1e369">For data collection during and after the early career workshop, this study employed
                                 a pre-and post-test design. At the beginning of the workshop, thirteen participants
                                 were invited to respond to an ex-ante paper survey (one person did not participate
                                 in the workshop even though he/she was invited) of which twelve filled out the survey.
                                 All items included in the paper survey were open-ended questions, which should have
                                 given respondents the opportunity to examine their perspectives and their experiences.
                                 The ex-ante survey aimed at collecting background information on workshop participants’
                                 educational experiences and their motives for seeking participatory settings with
                                 stakeholders during their PhD and post-docs research. Moreover, the survey yielded
                                 early career researchers’ experiences and perspectives of best practices and common
                                 stumbling blocks when collaborating with stakeholders. Early career researchers also
                                 were asked to come up with some of their very own recommendations that could be undertaken
                                 after the workshop to improve participatory research training and higher education
                                 for inter-and transdisciplinary in Austria (see Table <a href="#Tab1">1</a>). To be able to complement the results of the ex-ante survey with direct observations,
                                 the authors documented collective reflections among workshop participants using flip
                                 charts and field notes.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e374">Within a week after the workshop, an online post-workshop survey was sent out to collect
                                 participants’ judgements of the effectiveness of the workshop. The post-workshop survey
                                 addressed participants’ self-assessments whether the collective reflection has been
                                 useful to improve personal knowledge regarding participatory approaches, and focussed
                                 on the workshops’ effectiveness in resolving (some) stumbling blocks related to stakeholder
                                 involvement (see Table <a href="#Tab2">2</a>).

                              <p id="d1e379">Both the data from the ex-ante and ex-post survey as well as data from collected reflections
                                 during the workshop were qualitatively analysed using thematic content analysis. Content
                                 analysis started by reading through workshop participants’ written answers, and then
                                 two authors independently coded the data from the survey into text-based categories.
                                 Those categories should reflect early career researchers’ perspective and experiences
                                 and were qualitatively compared after the coding procedure for inter-coder agreement.
                                 During the content analysis, the following steps were taken be each coder: (a) obtaining
                                 immersion with the written data (i.e. each author familiarised himself/herself with
                                 the data set by reading through the text), (b) identifying main meaning units in the
                                 original data (i.e. each author extracted thematic paragraphs that were common to
                                 most responses, (c) contrasting groups of similar responses, and (d) choosing text-based
                                 reference examples from the dataset [<a href="#R43">43</a>].

                                    <p id="d1e531">The results show that most early career climate change and sustainability researchers
                                       attending the workshop had academic backgrounds in interdisciplinary fields. Most
                                       of them were trained in interdisciplinary bachelor’s or master’s programs, like environmental
                                       sciences, geography, natural resources management, ecological engineering or human
                                       and social ecology. Only two participants were trained in a more disciplinary field,
                                       namely economics. Since those fields traditionally are open for transdisciplinarity,
                                       every second workshop participant therefore knew about the potential added-value of
                                       including societal stakeholders in climate change and sustainability research before
                                       the workshop. Reasons for involving stakeholders into research practice that were
                                       picked up by workshop participants during their undergraduate education were manifold.
                                       For example, intense collaborations with stakeholders were argued to be effective
                                       for societal change and also justified since <i>‘stakeholders could have the necessary knowledge for a given research question’</i> or simply because <i>‘climate change and sustainability research are dealing with real world problems and
                                          therefore many people of society are affected’</i>. Moreover, the practice of inviting stakeholders into the research process could
                                       <i>‘improve research due to a reality check’</i>, and <i>‘it ensures that decisions in planning are O.K. for people’</i>.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e545">Workshop participants also argued to have learned about several reasons for not involving
                                       stakeholders in their research projects during their higher education. This is because
                                       <i>‘stakeholder participation can also consume a lot of resources and may not lead to
                                          the wanted results’</i>, or because collaboration between scientists and societal stakeholders is believed
                                       to be <i>‘time-consuming’</i> and there is the risk that <i>‘results may not be reproducible’</i>.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e556">The analysis of workshop participants’ educational experiences also revealed that
                                       besides gaining generic insights into inter- and transdisciplinarity, they also received
                                       some more specific methodological training on how to engage with stakeholders before
                                       enrolling in a PhD program or accepting a post-doc position. Workshop participants
                                       either learned about participatory approaches like <i>‘agent-based modelling’</i> or <i>‘wider transdisciplinary theories’</i>. Other tools for stakeholder involvement and participatory research the participants
                                       had experience with were applying <i>‘expert interviews’</i>, <i>‘focus groups’</i>, <i>‘role plays’</i>, <i>‘scenario analysis’</i>, <i>‘world-café’</i>, <i>‘workshops’</i> and even <i>‘climate narratives’</i>. Among workshop participants, there was consensus that especially <i>‘qualitative methods’</i> from the social sciences are particularly suitable for transdisciplinary research
                                       endeavours.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e589">Some participants also reported that they have already collaborated with stakeholders
                                       during their bachelor’s or master’s programmes. For example, participants did research
                                       with <i>‘visitors of Austrian National Parks’</i>, <i>‘natural hazard managers’</i>, <i>‘farmers’</i>, <i>‘members of institutions, administration and municipalities’</i>, <i>‘teenagers’</i> and <i>‘decision-makers in the Austrian climate and energy sector’</i>. Different levels of science-society interactions were reached inasmuch some workshop
                                       participants engaged with societal stakeholders during their bachelor’s or master’s
                                       for <i>‘risk communication’</i> or just <i>‘polling’</i>. Others involved stakeholders in <i>‘design thinking processes’</i> or <i>‘participatory scenario analysis’</i>.

                                       participants continued to conduct inter-and transdisciplinary research. They are recently
                                       contributing to three main scientific fields: <i>climate change research</i> (i.e. focusing on management, communication/education and behaviour); <i>flood risk research</i> (i.e. focusing on management, communication and behaviour); and <i>disaster risk reduction</i> (i.e. focusing on vulnerability, communication, and management). Other fields were
                                       land-use dynamics (i.e. focusing on scenario building), <i>sustainability science</i> (i.e. focusing on the Anthropocene age), <i>responsible research and innovation, de-growth studies and feminist methodologies</i>.

                                    <p id="d1e642">Across all identified research fields, most workshop participants claimed that they
                                       would feel increasingly required to develop integrative skills as well as competencies
                                       in risk and science communication. They also argued that more knowledge on and methodological
                                       know-how for participatory settings could be useful to better navigate transdisciplinary
                                       research and its outcomes. Two statements reflect those perspectives:

                                          one can relate to’</i>.
                                       Respondent B: <i>‘For researchers in climate change adaptation, it is crucial to know different theories

                                    <p id="d1e652">Workshop participants also argued that working with stakeholders would require ongoing
                                       learning and that practical experience is highly valued by their institutions and
                                       teams. Two additional statements reflect their views:

                                    <p id="d1e662">The results on research experiences indicated that workshop participants reach different
                                       levels of engagement when working with stakeholders in their research projects. These
                                       phases of engagement are referred to as (1) information, (2) consultation, (3) collaboration
                                       and (4) empowerment [<a href="#R44">44</a>]. Most participants claimed that, in their research projects, they usually inform,
                                       consult and collaborate with stakeholders under a common research goal. Just one participant
                                       claimed that stakeholders would be empowered through his or her research project.
                                       Even as deep engagement between researchers and stakeholders was perceived as highly
                                       important it was also recognised that <i>‘empowerment is difficult to measure’</i>.

                                    <p id="d1e670">Participatory tools used by workshop participants during their research projects before
                                       the workshop mainly referred to conventional project management tools and some qualitative
                                       research methods. For example, <i>‘workshop settings’</i> or <i>‘role plays’</i> were undertaken to establish collaboration, and <i>‘design thinking’</i> as well as <i>‘serious games’</i> were used for co-production of knowledge or policy options. Participants applied
                                       <i>‘semi-structured interviews’</i>, <i>‘surveys’</i> and <i>‘thematic mapping’</i> in efforts to consult stakeholders. In terms of epistemological theories for communication
                                       with stakeholders, <i>‘constructivism’</i> was perceived as an effective approach or theory for participatory research endeavours.
                                       
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e697">The results of this category also show that even though most workshop participants
                                       have learned about inter-and transdisciplinarity during their undergraduate years
                                       they still face several stumbling blocks when conducting their postgraduate inter-and
                                       transdisciplinary climate change and sustainability research. A typical stumbling
                                       block was finding a common language with stakeholders for adequately transitioning
                                       scientific content to societal contexts. Establishing communication routines to express
                                       the societal relevance of inter- and transdisciplinary research outcomes was a reported
                                       stumbling block as well. Another issue was building trust between researchers and
                                       stakeholders. Two statements reflect this perspective:
                                    </p>

                                          need clear messages for their decisions’</i>.

                                    <p id="d1e718">The workshop participants recognised several benefits of inter- and transdisciplinary

Nevertheless, they also were concerned with
                                       some other challenges related to the analysis and dissemination of transdisciplinary
                                       processes, like <i>‘finding adequate transdisciplinary journals’</i> and <i>‘arguing for a certain participatory method or theory in front of senior colleagues’</i>. Problems like <i>‘testing the effectiveness of transdisciplinary research by intersubjective means’</i> and <i>‘gaining the acceptance from non-transdisciplinary colleagues’</i> were reported as well.

                                       that they have gained new knowledge related to participatory approaches and argued
                                       to have deepened their understanding of collaboration with societal stakeholders.
                                       More specifically, workshop participants claimed to have learned about new methods
                                       to engage with different types of stakeholders, and were becoming more aware of which
                                       factors could limit a transdisciplinary research design. One statement is given below:

                                          within studies. I also gained the insight that prior to the selection of stakeholders,
                                          an analysis should be conducted to better know your audience and the types of benefits
                                          that stakeholders can bring into research projects. I learned that the process from

                                       it was also mentioned that a workshop never can replace learning from personally practising

                                       that a more profound understanding of the different levels of engagement with stakeholders

                                    <p id="d1e836">It was further tried to embed the potential improvements recommended by workshop participants
                                       into a larger context using the approach from Killion <i>et al.</i> [<a href="#R31">31</a>] (see Figure <a href="#Fig2">2</a>). Like them we plotted each single measure against its assumed implementation effort
                                       to inform department leaders, deans of studies, lectures, and other scientific professionals
                                       who are usually responsible for developing higher education. We also evaluated whether
                                       each measure could be aligned with existing science curricular in the Austrian university
                                       system or not. The results of this reflective process suggest that all measures could
                                       be theoretically applied, but would have different outcomes to learners. For example,
                                       it should be possible for study committees and lectures to develop and integrate thematic
                                       lectures on inter-and transdisciplinarity into existing bachelor’s and master’s programmes
                                       that set out to prepare students for solving climate change and sustainability issues.
                                       Such conceptual lectures could be used to elaborate on social science theories on
                                       communication and/or science-society collaborations as well to introduce technical
                                       toolkits showcasing frameworks and methods and its specific advantages and disadvantages
                                       for participatory research with stakeholders. Workshop participants however claimed
                                       that transdisciplinarity must also be personally experienced and therefore they recommended
                                       that coming generations of climate change and sustainability researchers in Austria
                                       could benefit from authentic learning in excursions, hands-on courses and mini-projects
                                       with stakeholders during their undergraduate education. It is further believed that
                                       an improved transdisciplinary education not only could lead to scientific excellence
                                       in the long-term but could also reduce trivial but often experienced stumbling-blocks
                                       when collaborating with societal stakeholders. Referring to practical stumbling-blocks,
                                       workshop participants reflected on each measure’s potential for preparing early career
                                       researchers for more successful inter-and transdisciplinary grant-writing, sound project
                                       management and more flexible communication skills. The latter is important for translating
                                       inter-and transdisciplinary research into real-life management contexts.

                              <p id="d1e860">This paper set out to qualitatively examine twelve early career climate change and
                                 sustainability researchers’ (and young professionals’) educational and practical experiences
                                 in conducting participatory research with stakeholders in the context of Austria.
                                 Thematic coding of survey data and documented workshop reflections showed that participants
                                 had received undergraduate education on inter-and transdisciplinarity and had practical
                                 experiences before choosing to work with stakeholders in their recent PhD/post-doc
                                 projects. Nevertheless, several stumbling-blocks are found to complicate their every-day
                                 collaboration with stakeholders and the workshop was perceived as a good opportunity
                                 to engage in peer discussion and practice self-reflexivity. Reflections during the
                                 workshop resulted in several recommendations for alternative learning concepts to
                                 improve current inter-and transdisciplinary education at Austrian universities.

                                    <p id="d1e865">Results of this study confirm previous research insights derived from examining other
                                       contexts than Austria. For example, findings from Haider <i>et al.</i>, who surveyed 325 early career sustainability scientists in the broader network of
                                       resilience research and practice during the Resilience 2014 conference in Montpelier,
                                       France, also apply to early career climate change and sustainability researchers in
                                       Austria: (a) workshop participants mainly were trained in interdisciplinary bachelor’s
                                       or master’s programmes and (b) participants’ practical experiences with stakeholders
                                       underline that ‘methodological groundedness’ (i.e. the ability of a researcher to
                                       understand and put a certain transdisciplinary method into practice) as well as ‘epistemic
                                       agility’ (i.e. the ability of a researcher to understand claims about through and
                                       knowledge outside academia) are understood as key guiding principles for successful
                                       participatory research with stakeholders ([<a href="#R27">27</a>], p.&nbsp;197).
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e873">Our results also agree with Killion <i>et al.</i> [<a href="#R31">31</a>] inasmuch workshop participants reported that low levels of team-science skills and
                                       inappropriate project management are likely to raise practical difficulties for doctoral
                                       students during stakeholder involvement. Like Killion <i>et al.</i> [<a href="#R31">31</a>] we conclude that as more collaboration with stakeholders is expected by decision-makers,
                                       funders or senior colleagues, the more care must be given to systematically prepare
                                       pre-doc and post-doc researchers for establishing robust transdisciplinary platforms
                                       [<a href="#R45">45</a>, <a href="#R46">46</a>]. This means that science networks in Austria and other countries are recommended
                                       to provide sufficient institutional support for developing the next generation of
                                       inter- and transdisciplinary researchers. This should be undertaken not only through
                                       increased levels of funding [<a href="#R47">47</a>], but also by offering continuous learning opportunities that equip the next generation
                                       of scholars with a deep understanding of agency-based approaches and public engagement
                                       [<a href="#R48">48</a>].
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e900">Going beyond the existing literature by assessing the workshop participants’ previous
                                       undergraduate education experiences, our results show that most workshop participants
                                       were knowledgeable about state-of-the-art methods in participatory research, like
                                       world-cafés or stakeholder discussions in focus groups, already prior to their PhD
                                       or post-doc projects. Some even reported to use facilitation tools like design thinking
                                       in their current research activities. None of the workshop participants however indicated
                                       to have prior knowledge or practical experience with methods for real-life transdisciplinary
                                       experimentation, like real-world laboratories [<a href="#R49">49</a>], the future search conference method or other tools relevant for facilitating sustainable
                                       outcomes among stakeholder groups. Methodological guidance can be found in the toolkit
                                       compendium of the scientific journal <i>GAIA-Ecological Perspectives for Science and Society</i> [<a href="#R50">50</a>]. We think that limited awareness of tools useful to transdisciplinary experimentation
                                       is problematic because it implies that ways to effective knowledge integration, which
                                       is the process by which transdisciplinary research combines scientific outcomes and
                                       non-academic knowledge to trigger real-life solutions [<a href="#R51">51</a>], are unknown to young climate change and sustainability researchers. A weak understanding
                                       of strategies to re-integrate outcomes of transdisciplinary research into societal
                                       practice [<a href="#R20">20</a>] could also explain why most participants were sceptical whether their PhD or post-doc
                                       research is effective in empowering stakeholders for sustainability.

                                    <p id="d1e920">One of the most important findings of this case-study is that interdisciplinary bachelor’s
                                       or master’s programs in Austria do not necessarily prepare early career climate change
                                       and sustainability researchers with the conceptual knowledge as well as management
                                       skills for stakeholder involvement. Degrees in environmental sciences or human and
                                       social ecology may prepare students for taking more holistic approaches to problem
                                       solving and may strengthen their systems thinking skills [<a href="#R52">52</a>]. It is however argued that this is not enough for solving challenges in transdisciplinary
                                       research, like dealing with different epistemological realities, being flexible in
                                       co-production of knowledge or gaining higher levels of self-reflexivity for critically
                                       evaluating one owns transdisciplinary research [<a href="#R21">21</a>]. Most workshop participants have directly entered the inter-and transdisciplinary
                                       arena after their graduation. Participatory research trainings sporadically taken
                                       during the first and second years of the PhD therefore might not be the only optimal
                                       strategy to foster early career researchers’ participatory research competences, especially
                                       if average time of institutional employment during PhD stage in Austria is limited
                                       to three years. Hence it is proposed that new and innovative pedagogic strategies
                                       applied already during bachelor’s or master’s programmes could be a promising educational
                                       investment for sustainable development in Austria; these might include several of
                                       our workshop participants’ recommendations, like offering inter- and transdisciplinary
                                       mini-projects or hands-on courses. In such learning activities, learners should be
                                       allowed to freely experiment with participatory approaches, and such undergraduate
                                       teachings may also make a meaningful contribution to the above-mentioned science plan

                                       central, however benefits must be offered by Universities to keep societal actors
                                       engaged over longer periods of time. We suggest, for example, providing stakeholders
                                       free access to scientific journals as well as highlighting throughout the process
                                       the practical relevance of co-produced research results for the stakeholders’ fields
                                       of activity. Mainstreaming transdisciplinarity into the academic system is central
                                       [<a href="#R53">53</a>] and this also was discussed during the early career workshop.

                                       make undergraduate students more familiar with widely accepted stakeholder frameworks
                                       [<a href="#R54">54</a>, <a href="#R55">55</a>], and toolkits for managing participatory research processes. Toolkits like the ones
                                       of Welp <i>et al.</i> [<a href="#R22">22</a>] or Wittmayer and Hölscher [<a href="#R56">56</a>] could become common knowledge for upcoming inter-and transdisciplinary climate change
                                       and sustainability researchers. Overall, our suggestions for improving higher education
                                       in Austria were found to be very well in line with Wittmayer and Schäpke [<a href="#R57">57</a>], who argued that transdisciplinary cooperation should already be part of education
                                       programs to enable young researchers to deal with the challenges ahead.

                                       Workshop
                                    </h3>
                                    <p id="d1e960">Interestingly, the workshop not only was reported to be effective in providing new
                                       knowledge but also to foster peer-group discussion. It also seemed to have strengthened
                                       early career researchers’ critical thinking about inter-and transdisciplinarity. Several
                                       reference examples support this claim. Mutual learning between workshop participants
                                       also included discussions between those researchers who published a transdisciplinary
                                       paper before and others who were interested to do so. These workshops therefore can
                                       be a place in sharing knowledge on, and publishing experiences in, the steadily emerging
                                       peer-reviewed academic journals that do foster transdisciplinary research, for example
                                       <i>Ecology and Society, GAIA, One Earth, Sustainability Science, Ambio and others</i> [<a href="#R58">58</a>]. What must be critically admitted however is that the workshop design characterized
                                       by a short initial lecture given by a senior researcher and the strong emphasis on
                                       group reflections was not fully effective in resolving workshop participants’ methodological
                                       stumbling-blocks with stakeholder involvement. For better methodical training a more
                                       interactive workshop design therefore must be chosen in which methods are tested and/or
                                       in which not only senior researcher but also stakeholders could be invited. Ideally,
                                       such stakeholders should have collaborated in transdisciplinary projects before and
                                       should be willing to share their lessons learned. Despite this limitation, the workshop
                                       indicates that there is a largely unexploited interest among early career climate
                                       change and sustainability researchers in Austria to reach rigorousness in participatory
                                       research with societal stakeholders. Since this interest fits well into the scope
                                       of the above-mentioned science plan (see background chapter), the CCCA and similar
                                       national science consortia are encouraged to build on this common interest by promoting
                                       and holding early career workshops on a regular basis. Furthermore, they are encouraged
                                       to develop their own forms of innovative training for inter-and transdisciplinary
                                       research [<a href="#R39">39</a>]. Examples of mutual learning opportunities that are also relevant to the Austrian
                                       context are the Postdoc Academy for Transformational Leadership [<a href="#R59">59</a>], the td Academy [<a href="#R60">60</a>] or the TD summer school from the Leuphana University, Germany [<a href="#R61">61</a>].

                                    <p id="d1e984">Several limitations of this study are acknowledged. Firstly, the study’s sample size
                                       (N=12) is small and therefore we avoid a generalization of our results beyond the
                                       national context of Austria. This country approach to generalization is in line with
                                       similar studies also focussing on early career challenges related to transdisciplinary
                                       sustainability research, for example Killion <i>et al.</i> [<a href="#R31">31</a>] (N=26, United States of America) or Jaeger-Erben <i>et al.</i> [<a href="#R28">28</a>] (N=12, Germany). Small sample sizes per se are not problematic to single-case study
                                       research inasmuch they can be instructive to complex social phenomena [<a href="#R42">42</a>, <a href="#R62">62</a>]. However, we also understand that our results and recommendations should be interpreted
                                       with caution inasmuch they are not fully representative of all early career climate
                                       change and sustainability scientists in Austria. We therefore encourage other scholars
                                       to scale up our workshop approach and to invite a larger number of early career researchers
                                       to such events. But at the same time, we also note that such future research could
                                       learn from our qualitative insights since they have pilot-study character. The second
                                       limitation relates to the selection of workshop participants. Since participants had
                                       to apply for the workshop, the sample of course does not account for other PhD or
                                       post-doc researchers in the fields of climate change and sustainability who probably
                                       were not interested, had not time to join the event or simply were not informed about
                                       the workshop. Furthermore, the qualitative analysis of the workshop’s effectiveness
                                       only is based on workshop participants’ self-assessment. Self-reported learning of
                                       course is subjective and future works are therefore recommended to explore whether
                                       participants had tested strategies from the reflective workshop in their early career
                                       research practice more objectively.

                              <p id="d1e1008">This case study has provided in-depth insight into Austrian early career climate change
                                 and sustainability researchers’ educational and practical experiences when working
                                 with societal stakeholders in their inter- and transdisciplinary PhD or post-doc projects.
                                 Results confirm those of previous international studies on early career researchers
                                 and suggest that mutual learning among peers and senior researchers about stakeholder
                                 involvement, e.g. in the form of focused workshops, can have several positive effects.
                                 Workshop participants expand their knowledge, reflect more critically about transdisciplinary
                                 research designs, and simply can build a professional network. In addition, we find
                                 that graduate research training should not be perceived as the only strategy to resolve
                                 conceptual and practical stumbling-blocks related to participatory research with societal
                                 stakeholders. One of our main conclusions is that early career researchers would benefit
                                 substantially if their preceding bachelor’s and master’s programmes in the fields
                                 of climate change and sustainability sciences would incorporate more practice-oriented
                                 transdisciplinary learning activities. This includes, amongst others, more elaborate
                                 teaching techniques on how to re-integrate transdisciplinary research outcomes back
                                 into society.
