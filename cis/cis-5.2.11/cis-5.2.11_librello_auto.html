                                 Tailoring the public participation process to the local context is a popular strategy
                                 for ensuring sufficient turnout and meaningful engagement, but this strategy faces
                                 several challenges. Through a review of case studies of public participation in urban
                                 development projects, we identify ten typical misalignments between the public participation
                                 process and the local context, including the lack of policy maker support, adverse
                                 personal circumstances of participants, low collaborative capacity, and mistrust,
                                 among others. When a public participation process is not aligned to the local context,
                                 the process may generate outcomes that compromise public interests, inequitably distribute
                                 benefits among stakeholders, or favor powerful private interests. This study offers
                                 caution and guidance to planning practitioners and researchers on how to contextualize
                                 public participation in urban development projects through the categorization of common
                                 misalignments that ought to be avoided.</span></div>

                              <p id="d1e95">Once a top-down process, over the past four decades governance has shifted to the
                                 local level, and there towards civic engagement and the democratization of policy
                                 making [<a href="#R01">1</a>, <a href="#R02">2</a>, <a href="#R03">3</a>]. Civil society now plays a larger role in setting priorities for and contributing
                                 to local community development, environmental management, transportation, health,
                                 and public safety issues [<a href="#R04">4</a>, <a href="#R05">5</a>]. Highlighting its general acceptance in society, public participation has become
                                 a rhetorical feature of good local governance and sustainability governance [<a href="#R03">3</a>, <a href="#R06">6</a>, <a href="#R07">7</a>, <a href="#R08">8</a>, <a href="#R09">9</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e128">Urban development is one prominent arena for local governance efforts. Following the
                                 general trend, public participation is now a common feature of urban development projects
                                 [<a href="#R10">10</a>, <a href="#R11">11</a>, <a href="#R12">12</a>, <a href="#R13">13</a>], in particular when they aim at fostering urban sustainability [<a href="#R14">14</a>, <a href="#R15">15</a>]. Its rise in urban development in general, and urban sustainability efforts in particular,
                                 is due to a number of benefits public participation is assumed to offer.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e149">Supportive perspectives contend that public participation builds trust between participants
                                 and experts [<a href="#R16">16</a>], and between the public and decision makers [<a href="#R05">5</a>]; facilitates conflict resolution [<a href="#R17">17</a>]; establishes support for implementation [<a href="#R18">18</a>, <a href="#R19">19</a>]; creates equitable processes, which in turn produce just outcomes [<a href="#R20">20</a>]; fosters social learning and builds capacity in individuals as well as across society
                                 [<a href="#R21">21</a>, <a href="#R22">22</a>, <a href="#R23">23</a>]; engages stakeholders with diverse perspectives that collaborate to understand and
                                 solve complex societal problems [<a href="#R24">24</a>, <a href="#R25">25</a>]; develops social capital through the formulation of social networks [<a href="#R23">23</a>, <a href="#R26">26</a>]; and builds institutional capacity [<a href="#R26">26</a>]. As such, there are many case studies that describe public participation as a beneficial
                                 process [<a href="#R18">18</a>, <a href="#R27">27</a>, <a href="#R28">28</a>, <a href="#R29">29</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e208">While there are numerous arguments in favor of participation, other researchers and
                                 practitioners caution that there are also challenges to and adverse effects from public
                                 participation: governments are often overly dominant in public participation processes
                                 [<a href="#R26">26</a>, <a href="#R30">30</a>], or lack capacity to conduct such processes [<a href="#R04">4</a>]; civil society’s civic capacity is declining, and many citizens now lack competencies
                                 needed to participate [<a href="#R04">4</a>, <a href="#R31">31</a>]; citizens often do not have the time to meaningfully engage [<a href="#R26">26</a>], or are apathetic and not interested in participating [<a href="#R32">32</a>, <a href="#R33">33</a>], while others distrust participation as a process that bends to manipulative sponsors
                                 and powerful elites [<a href="#R34">34</a>]; and resources to participate are not equally distributed to disadvantaged groups
                                 [<a href="#R26">26</a>], among other challenges. As a result, public participation processes are often formulaic
                                 [<a href="#R35">35</a>], susceptible to cooptation [<a href="#R31">31</a>], or can even be coercive [<a href="#R36">36</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e251">Many pitfalls can be mitigated and avoided through careful process design [<a href="#R37">37</a>, <a href="#R38">38</a>], and one popular recommendation is to design processes to fit the local context
                                 [<a href="#R07">7</a>, <a href="#R37">37</a>, <a href="#R38">38</a>, <a href="#R39">39</a>, <a href="#R40">40</a>]. Yet, little specific directives are provided for how such contextualization might
                                 be achieved.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e275">Here, the concept of local context in public planning may include considerations of
                                 local priorities and issues specific to locations across geographic settings, from
                                 local [<a href="#R07">7</a>] to regional and national-scales [<a href="#R37">37</a>]. Working within and across spatial scales, one must consider contextual factors
                                 including local knowledge of participants; public preferences; types of interested
                                 stakeholders; local conditions; the environmental context; laws guiding public decision
                                 and policy making; local and national interests; social relationships within communities
                                 [<a href="#R37">37</a>]; cultural norms of decision making; race, class, and gender; environmental problems
                                 and their significance; and political stability [<a href="#R40">40</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e289">Dietz and Stern [<a href="#R37">37</a>] identify numerous contextual factors for public participation processes in environmental
                                 decision making, and they organize these factors into two categories: (1) Agency Factors
                                 and (2) Participant Factors. Von Korff et al. [<a href="#R38">38</a>] list contextual factors that include conflict between stakeholders, participants’
                                 previous experiences in public processes, legal and regulatory rules, budgets, and
                                 stakeholder interest (or apathy). Bryson et al. [39] define both a general and a specific
                                 context. They explain the general context as the “social, demographic, political,
                                 technological, physical, and other features and trends in an organization’s environment
                                 (p. 25)”. The specific context, they note, includes “stakeholders, applicable mandates,
                                 [and] resource availability (p. 25)”. All of these issues may be influenced by and
                                 specific to the location where a participatory process is being designed and/or carried
                                 out.

                              <p id="d1e297">Urban development is generally guided by planning processes that include opportunities
                                 for varying degrees of public involvement on topics such as transportation, land use,
                                 infrastructure, housing, economic development, and environmental management. Yet,
                                 public participation may not be fruitful if the process is not well aligned to the
                                 local context. The objective of this research is to better understand the local context
                                 of urban development projects by asking what categorizable impediments to high quality
                                 public participation arise when the participatory process is not attuned to the local
                                 context.

                              <p id="d1e304">Public participation is often vaguely defined in the literature, while in actuality
                                 it can take many shapes and forms. Dietz and Stern [<a href="#R37">37</a>] acknowledge that public participation may encompass all facets of democracy, including
                                 voting, expressing opinion, interest groups, demonstrations, and even songs. Thus,
                                 we first present the concept of public participation we adopt in this study, which
                                 is based on a proposal made by Wiek et al. [<a href="#R41">41</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e312">The concept composes three key features of public participation (Figure <a href="#Fig1">1</a>), dealing with the questions of who is doing what, with whom, when, for what purpose,
                                 and with what outcome [<a href="#R42">42</a>]. First, public participation as conceptualized here is part of and therefore depends
                                 on an ‘official’ urban development project, in which the public participates. We focus
                                 here on participation that occurs in ‘officialized spaces’ and is part of regulated
                                 procedures [<a href="#R43">43</a>]. The urban development project, as the main process, is structured into various
                                 phases (e.g., preparing, planning, implementing, and evaluating), with each phase
                                 generating certain outcomes, including a proposal, a plan, real-world changes, and
                                 recommendations.

                              <p id="d1e333">Second, the urban development project is supervised by Strategic Agents such as elected
                                 officials and investors (applying and/or influencing laws and regulations), and is
                                 carried out through Operating Agents such as planners and experts (who report back
                                 to the Strategic Agents). The Operating Agents engage stakeholders through the public
                                 participation process; stakeholders might include citizens, residents, non-profit
                                 organizations, businesses, governmental agencies (not supervising), and the media.

                              <p id="d1e335">Third, through the public participation process the public might participate in one,
                                 several, or all phases of the urban development project, and to varying degrees. The
                                 public participation process may rely on different standardized procedures, such as
                                 public meetings, citizen juries, focus groups, stakeholder workshops, consensus conferences,
                                 and web-based engagements, among others [<a href="#R44">44</a>]. Apart from substantive inputs that might inform, to varying degrees, the outcomes
                                 of the phases as indicated above—the public participation process can also yield less
                                 tangible outcomes such as agreement, trust, new or strengthened relationships, and
                                 enhanced capacities [<a href="#R23">23</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e343">Even within the parameters used in this study to define public participation, there
                                 is a wide spectrum of processes ranging in levels of participant engagement. For decades,
                                 planning literature has addressed this issue. Arnstein [<a href="#R01">1</a>] presented a framework for interpreting degrees of citizen power in local decision
                                 making, ranging from manipulative processes, to tokenistic engagements like public
                                 hearings, to instances of delegated power and true citizen control. In the years following,
                                 many scholars further studied, revised, and built upon Arnstein’s concept to define
                                 public participation as an engaged and empowered mechanism for the public [for examples,
                                 see [<a href="#R07">7</a>, <a href="#R16">16</a>, <a href="#R26">26</a>, <a href="#R37">37</a>, <a href="#R45">45</a>, <a href="#R46">46</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e367">Today, there is much support in the literature for public participation processes
                                 to be popular, deliberative mechanisms for shaping public policy. For instance, Voogd
                                 and Woltjer [<a href="#R47">47</a>] present five ethical criteria for what they term communicative planning: (1) involve
                                 all relevant stakeholders in the planning process, (2) prevent cultural and educational
                                 differences from hindering stakeholders, (3) design manageable and transparent planning
                                 processes, (4) provide participating stakeholders with necessary professional knowledge,
                                 and (5) prioritize the interests of stakeholders in defining and weighting solutions.
                                 Fung and Wright [<a href="#R27">27</a>] idealize empowered deliberative democracy (EDD), which pursues participatory and
                                 deliberative governance by (1) devolving power to local stakeholders, (2) centrally
                                 managing participation through governmental structures, and (3) institutionalizing
                                 participation within government. Abelson et al. [<a href="#R48">48</a>] evaluate deliberative processes in terms of (1) representation of stakeholders;
                                 (2) legitimacy, reasonableness, and responsiveness of procedures; (3) sharing, presentation,
                                 and interpretation of information; and (4) outcomes in terms of legitimacy and accountability,
                                 participant satisfaction, and level of consensus.
                                 
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e378">All of these conceptualizations of public participation define a decision-making process
                                 that engages diverse stakeholders through deliberative procedures to shape policy.
                                 In this article, we focus on how the public participation process is designed by planners
                                 and other Operating Agents, considering the features just described. When aligning
                                 the process to the local context, planners need to consider the interplay between
                                 issue, public agency, and participant [<a href="#R37">37</a>, <a href="#R49">49</a>], as well as conflicts between stakeholders, participants’ previous experiences in
                                 civic engagement, legal and regulatory settings, budgets, and stakeholder interest
                                 and apathy [<a href="#R38">38</a>]. Furthermore, factors including cultural norms, race, socio-economic status, gender,
                                 the salience of issues, and the political climate also contribute to how well a participatory
                                 process fits within the local context [<a href="#R40">40</a>].

                              <p id="d1e395">This study inspects the common challenges to realizing the ideals of public participation
                                 with the assumption that considering such challenges at the outset will help project
                                 planners understand the local context of where a participatory process is designed
                                 and implemented. Through exploratory research, we inductively defined misalignments
                                 between the public participation process and local context by (1) reviewing case studies
                                 from peer-reviewed literature on public participation in urban development projects,
                                 (2) recording challenges identified in the cases, and (3) grouping the identified
                                 challenges into overarching categories. We then conceptualize these challenge categories
                                 as misalignments between the process (as designed by planners and experts) and the
                                 local context.

                              <p id="d1e397">To select case studies for review we used the following search terms: <i>case study</i> AND <i>public participation</i>; <i>public participation</i> AND <i>urban development</i>; <i>public participation</i> AND <i>urban planning</i>; and <i>challenge</i> AND <i>public participation</i>. We considered only resources published since 1995.

                              <p id="d1e424">To filter the search results, we created a small set of selection criteria. First,
                                 this study seeks to learn from real cases of public participation in urban development
                                 projects. Therefore, we eliminated pieces that were strictly theoretical or that spoke
                                 in generalities without referencing specific cases. Second, this study is only concerned
                                 with public participation in urban development projects. Thus, we eliminated materials
                                 that discussed participation in contexts other than urban development settings. Third,
                                 we review only cases from the Global North. It is already challenging to compare experiences
                                 between such dissimilar cultures as northern Europe and the United States, and we
                                 chose to eliminate cases from developing countries that have much different development
                                 needs and conditions that further confound cross-context comparisons. Finally, this
                                 study synthesizes common challenges reported in the literature, and therefore considers
                                 only case studies that acknowledge real challenges that have arisen in public participation
                                 processes. After narrowing the case pool further, we consulted the reference sections
                                 of the relevant sources to uncover additional empirical studies that did not show
                                 up through the Boolean search. These methods yielded 24 cases. Table <a href="#Tab01">1</a> lists and describes the cases studied for this research.

                              <p id="d1e429">We approached this review with a heuristic developed in urban development projects
                                 with public participation we have been involved in over a five-year period in low-income
                                 neighborhoods in Phoenix, Arizona (2009–2014). Challenges we encountered include lack
                                 of collaborative capacity, civic competence, and sustainability literacy, as well
                                 as living conditions and personal circumstances not conducive to continuous and meaningful
                                 public engagement [<a href="#R41">41</a>]. As we reviewed case study literature on public participation in urban development,
                                 we recorded when a case provided an example of one of the misalignments we had ourselves
                                 experienced in past public participation projects. We also recorded when cases articulated
                                 a challenge that we had not previously considered. After reviewing all of the cases,
                                 we reviewed our draft list of challenges in public participation processes and created
                                 a list of potential misalignments.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e434">As noted above, we recognize the challenge of drawing conclusions across disparate
                                 settings. For this reason, we excluded studies from the Global South, but we still
                                 must confront the difficulties of conducting an analysis of cases in settings ranging
                                 from the United States to Northern Europe to Australia. In each of these locations
                                 historical norms, governance regimes, and the local environment, among other factors,
                                 play a significant role in shaping the models of public engagements that are pursued
                                 and impact the way that participation plays out. To cope with the array of cases across
                                 multiple diverse contexts, we required that a potential misalignment must be found
                                 in at least three of the articles we reviewed. Capturing examples from multiple settings
                                 allowed us to draw careful conclusions generalized across dissimilar contexts. Furthermore,
                                 this consideration allowed for some quality control as the analysis is entirely dependent
                                 on the research of other scholars.

                                 into three categories within the participatory process. These three categories were
                                 derived inductively through the literature reviewed for this study. <i>Misalignments that Impede Process and Outcomes</i> pertains to top-down issues of whether policy makers and special interests support
                                 public participation processes, divest power to diverse stakeholders, and allow public
                                 input to shape policy. There is one misalignment under this category.

                                 experience. When these misalignments transpire, participation events may feature low
                                 participant turnout, and particular groups may not be included in the process. This
                                 category includes three misalignments.

                                 <i>Misalignments that Impede Participants’ Input</i> covers barriers experienced by participants that do attend events. These may include
                                 the values, preferences, and capacities of participants. [-10]When these misalignments
                                 arise, participants may refrain from full participation, they may feel unheard, or
                                 they may even obstruct the process (though it is important to consider that dissent
                                 within a deliberative process may actually be constructive [<a href="#R68">68</a>]). There are six misalignments reported for this category.

                                 presents a framework for understanding the local context within which the public participation

                                    <p id="d1e770">Top-down, institutional support is a critical factor for successful participation
                                       [<a href="#R69">69</a>, <a href="#R70">70</a>], and public administrators’ confidence in the public strongly influences citizen
                                       involvement in policy making [<a href="#R60">60</a>]. When the public participation process does not align with policy-maker support,
                                       it may be that decision makers are not willing to divest authority to the public or
                                       special interests hold more power than participating stakeholders. When this occurs,
                                       policy outcomes may not reflect participant recommendations, bringing into question
                                       whether the political impact equals the effort devoted by participants and the resources
                                       invested by process planners [<a href="#R71">71</a>]. Leino and Laine [<a href="#R66">66</a>] describe a participatory process to develop the traffic master plan for Tampere
                                       in Finland. A group of stakeholders, recruited by the city, convened to provide input
                                       to the plan. Participants felt, however, that they did not have sufficient influence
                                       through this process. Instead, they collaboratively wrote two position papers about
                                       the traffic plan and provided these as input. Decision makers did not consider the
                                       participants’ input, and the final plan did not reflect the participants’ preferences.
                                       In this case, the process broke down and participants lost faith in government, choosing
                                       to operate outside of the official process. Ultimately stakeholders received no return
                                       on the time they invested, and the city wasted resources holding a process that did
                                       not inform the final plan.

                                             and living conditions, planners and experts are not sensitive to the impact that stakeholders’
                                             lifestyles have on their ability and willingness to participate. Some obstacles to
                                             participating may include individuals working multiple jobs, caring for children,
                                             and lacking transportation, among others. When participation is not attuned to personal
                                             circumstances and living conditions of prospective participants, then events may be
                                             poorly attended or traditionally underrepresented groups (low-income individuals,
                                             minorities, women, youth) may be excluded. Through a study of the Minneapolis Neighborhood
                                             Revitalization Program (NRP) in Minnesota, United States, Fagotto and Fung [<a href="#R18">18</a>] identify certain groups that participate less, specifically communities of lower
                                             socioeconomic status. In these communities, resources like wealth, education, status,
                                             and time are not equally distributed and a lack of these resources presents a barrier
                                             to participation. The NRP, an empowered governance program for neighborhood improvement,
                                             demanded skill, time, and background knowledge, making it hard for some populations
                                             to participate. These challenges, among others established a process that favored
                                             homeowners, while in many neighborhoods renters and minorities did not sufficiently
                                             influence decision making.

                                             capacity and interest in participating in urban development projects. Putnam [<a href="#R72">72</a>] describes the general decline of civic engagement in the United States, including
                                             a reduction in political, civic, and religious participation; volunteering and philanthropy;

                                             was leading communities to become less civically engaged. As these neighborhoods lose
                                             a culture of community, they are experiencing social isolation and a decline in civic

                                             fail to engage stakeholders through means that are relevant to the context. In a mixed-income
                                             housing project in Chicago, professionals wished to engage relocated public housing
                                             residents through neighborhood association mechanisms that were commonly used to communicate
                                             with higher income neighborhood residents. The neighborhood association mechanism
                                             was not relevant to the relocated public housing residents because the associations
                                             were oriented towards homeownership and institutional interests with which public
                                             housing residents did not relate. Low-income renters had traditionally participated
                                             in Local Advisory Councils (LACs), which were common in public housing developments.
                                             LACs were disbanded in favor of neighborhood associations, and low-income residents
                                             lost their outlet for participation. Professional stakeholders (developers, property
                                             managers, etc.) thought it would be beneficial to integrate relocated public housing
                                             residents into mainstream associations, but the low-income residents instead felt
                                             disempowered. Because the government and professional actors would not engage with
                                             relocated public housing residents through mechanisms with which the population was
                                             comfortable, the interests of developers, institutional actors, and homeowners outweighed

                                             in government are some contributing factors to low participant trust. When the public
                                             participation process does not align with participants’ trust, individuals may choose

                                             Eversole [<a href="#R53">53</a>] describes a community consultation process for an aboriginal arts and economic development
                                             program in Australia. The process was managed by consultants seeking to empower urban
                                             aboriginal communities. The consultants did not communicate public meetings through
                                             the appropriate community channels, leading the consultants to be perceived as outsiders.
                                             This poor communication coupled with negative experiences from past participatory
                                             engagements led community members to distrust the process and to not participate.
                                             It is important to note that bad experiences in prior engagements compromised recruitment
                                             of participants for this case. Likewise, a poorly executed participation process today
                                             may compromise the success of future projects.

                                             input for engagement structure and have not considered whether prospective participants
                                             have preferences for how they might engage. When this happens, stakeholders may be

                                             acceptance, diminishing trust, and declining attendance at events. In a case study
                                             of urban forestry planning in Helsinki, Finland, authorities were concerned with the

                                             extensive, residents still felt that the process lacked sufficient opportunities for
                                             participation. While the public showed preferences for small group meetings and similar
                                             methods, planning authorities preferred to use surveys for data collection. The authors
                                             conclude that no single method is perfect for all situations and several methods should

                                             Instead, authorities saw this point as the beginning of the planning process and revised
                                             citizen input with little additional consultation. Because the tenants did not understand

                                             of ideas. In a public planning process for economic development in the London Borough
                                             of Hackney, policy makers sought to engage members of the population that were traditionally
                                             excluded from decision making. Through the process, citizens admitted that members
                                             of their community lacked the capacity to participate and that they had been given
                                             too much power too soon. Anger arose amongst participants because they felt empowerment
                                             and capacity building was poorly executed and treated as a formality [<a href="#R54">54</a>]. Conversely, Bailey et al. [<a href="#R20">20</a>] found that reducing skill demands of participants can produce broader participation
                                             and improve the input received through the process.

                                          <p id="d1e1178">While public participation is an assumed process in sustainability science, large
                                             segments of the public are not familiar or do not agree with sustainability norms
                                             and principles. When the public participation process does not align with participants’
                                             sustainability literacy the gap in knowledge and attitudes about sustainability between
                                             experts and stakeholders can be quite large. Also, in some parts of the United States,
                                             a sustainability agenda can be met with distrust. Infusing sustainability outcomes
                                             into participatory process outputs may require significant capacity building at the
                                             front end of the process or experts would have to insert their own perspectives post-process,
                                             reducing the credibility of outputs as public-driven. In the case of a participatory
                                             process for identifying sustainability indicators in Vancouver, Canada, participants
                                             admitted to substantial knowledge gaps regarding sustainability. At first, this lack
                                             of sustainability literacy impeded group progress. Through a study circle method,
                                             experts built participant capacity and participants successfully developed a robust

                                             be confronted with the challenge of leading participants through discussions of complex
                                             urban issues. When the public participation process does not align with participants’
                                             issue competence, participants may lack knowledge about urban issues, principles,
                                             processes, and planning mechanisms. [-30]Cities are complex webs of nested and interrelated

                                             discussions about urban challenges. In the Hackney economic development case discussed
                                             above, participants were at first unequipped to engage. One participant admitted that
                                             he didn’t understand a lot of what was being discussed at meetings, and other participants
                                             questioned the level of empowerment when they lacked the capacity to provide meaningful
                                             input. Other participants wished for a longer process that would provide more time
                                             to acquire the knowledge needed to understand the issues and influence policy. Ultimately,
                                             participants required and received capacity building on issues including crime, education,

                                 between the public participation process and policy maker support, civic engagement,
                                 and through participants’ personal circumstances and living conditions, engagement
                                 preferences, civic competence, collaborative capacity, expectations, trust, sustainability
                                 literacy, and issue competence. Designing public participation to fit the local context
                                 is a popular recommendation for state-of-the-art urban development projects, but the
                                 literature does not provide clear guidance for how this should be achieved. The ten
                                 misalignments between the public participation process and the local context identified
                                 in this article present a contextual frame for public participation process design
                                 that avoids major flaws.

                                          Substantiating these claims requires empirical evaluation of public participation

                                 for coping with the misalignments. The literature on public participation is mostly
                                 descriptive rather than prescriptive and lacks clear directives [<a href="#R44">44</a>]. Future research will need to study cases that have successfully coped with each
                                 misalignment to build an evidence-supported toolset of strategies for aligning participatory
                                 processes and contexts for sustainable urban development.

                              <p id="d1e1249">Finally, there is a dearth of evaluative studies of participatory processes in peer-reviewed

                                 for designing public participation. Defining the misalignments between process and
                                 context provides a framework for evaluating public participation processes as we can
                                 now ask how well a public participation process is aligned to the local context. Missing
                                 from this analysis are potential indicators for measuring each misalignment. By establishing
                                 indicators of misalignments and empirically studying real public participation processes,
                                 alignment could be measured by collecting data for each indicator. Addressing these
                                 misalignments better adapts a public participation process to the local context and
                                 presumably result in both a better process and better outcomes. This hypothesis must
                                 be tested and validated.

                              <p id="d1e1257">A public participation process that is attuned to the local context is the antithesis
                                 to the misalignment framework presented in this paper. Avoiding these misalignments
                                 is an aspirational goal and this framework provides a roadmap for achieving an implied
                                 vision for high quality public participation in urban development.
