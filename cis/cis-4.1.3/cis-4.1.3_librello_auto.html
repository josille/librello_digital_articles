                              we want to efficiently feed urban inhabitants with local agricultural produce while
                              benefiting from other functions filled by urban agricultural landscapes: namely, eco-systemic
                              functions or ecological and social functions. The second function will focus on methods
                              to regulate unbuilt land in urban areas which have virtually no regulations and others
                              which have strict controls preventing construction. The last will consist of possibilities
                              to build, what I would refer to as, urban agricultural commons: in other words, tangible
                              and intangible resources produced with farmers and gardeners for the inhabitants;
                              for their local consumption and for the quality of the living environment, based on
                              a political principle for common action. The concept of common is derived from the
                              works of socioeconomist E. Ostrom (1990; [1]) and French philosophers P. Dardot et
                              C. Laval (2014; [2]): “What is built in common”. It was applied to urban agriculture
                              and landscape (Donadieu, 2012, 2014; [3,4]). The concept of urban agriculture has
                              been used worldwide in the last twenty years by researchers, especially in France
                              by A. Fleury (2005; [5]) and P. Donadieu(1998; [6]), in Mediterranean regions (Nasr
                              and Padilla, 2004; [7]), in Asia, Africa and North and South America—all through the
                              publications of the Resource Centres Urban Agriculture &amp;amp; Food Security (RUAF;
                              [8]).</span></div>

                                    <p id="d1e74">There are two ways of producing food products around cities and for cities. The first,
                                       which is prevalent in terms of the number of producers, its economic weight and the
                                       surface area involved, concerns farmers and agricultural entrepreneurs. They produce
                                       for local markets (urban markets and shopping centres) or for more distant markets
                                       in the same country or abroad. They are market gardeners, wine growers, cereal growers,
                                       livestock farmers, nurserymen, etc. Some cultivate in fields and others cultivate
                                       in greenhouses. Their activity is a business, an agrobusiness. Some farmers receive
                                       support within the framework of the European Common Agricultural Policy and others,
                                       such as the livestock farmers, market gardeners and wine growers, receive little or
                                       none at all.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e76">The second way of producing food products concerns amateur gardeners who represent
                                       a small proportion in terms of numbers and the surface area cultivated. They cultivate
                                       family allotments and community gardens and are to be found in much greater numbers
                                       in northern and central Europe than in the Mediterranean region. Their objective is
                                       not business but subsistence and/or leisure; the benefits of cultivating; of mutual
                                       support and the possibility of offering solidarity to those in need of help, such
                                       as the unemployed.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e78">These agrobusinesses and amateur gardens occupy so-called open spaces: unbuilt spaces
                                       in urban areas, especially on the roofs of buildings, which provide the kinds of landscapes
                                       most appreciated by inhabitants. These agricultural and horticultural practices are
                                       often associated with woodlands, gardens, public and private parks and produce two
                                       types of urban agricultural landscapes. Subsistence landscapes are often regulated
                                       in the same way as in the north of Lisbon during the economic crisis (Figure <a href="#Fig01">1</a>).
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e83">As regards leisure, enjoyment and pedagogical purposes, this is the case of Paris
                                       with its collective gardens (in French: <i>jardins partagés</i>; [<a href="#R09">9</a>]). There are more than one hundred collective gardens in Paris, situated next to
                                       residential buildings and in public parks and schools,  all of which are encouraged
                                       by town authorities. These are places which foster social interaction, but which also
                                       help people to re-establish a relationship with cultivated and natural environments.
                                       They can also provide opportunities to develop professional skills and often represent
                                       a lifeline for marginalised populations.

                                    <p id="d1e101">Public authority interventions vary depending on political situations. In Switzerland,
                                       city authorities sometimes cover the costs of production sites, as in the case of
                                       the vineyard of the Lausanne City Farm, or of urban farmland in Geneva which has been
                                       protected from urban development since the 1960s (Figure <a href="#Fig02">2</a>).
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e106">Urban authorities and many inhabitants dislike anything that evokes disorder, insecurity
                                       or poverty, such as improvised gardening sheds built by gardeners. In France, people
                                       like orderly family allotment gardens such as those set up in the new town of Saint
                                       Quentin-en-Yvelines, near Versailles, in 1985, or in a public garden in Angers in
                                       2002 (Figure <a href="#Fig03">3</a>).
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e111">But for the main part, the urban agricultural order is the one produced by private
                                       agricultural enterprises on land, generally poorly protected from urbanisation. In
                                       France an average of 50,000 hectares of agricultural land disappears every year. Legal
                                       protection systems exist in almost all European countries but they insufficiently
                                       contain the pressure of urbanisation. In France, building permits given by the public
                                       authorities increases the value of land by 10 to 100. Only a strong political will,
                                       high environmental risks, extremely strong legal protection or exceptional profits
                                       from wine production (as in the region of Bordeaux,  France) are able to contain urban
                                       sprawl.

                                    <p id="d1e113">In the end, the issue for elected representatives, specialists and the inhabitants
                                       of urban areas is quite simple: how to choose beyond the alternative between, the
                                       landowners' right of disposing of agricultural land, and the construction of urban
                                       public agricultural areas on private or public land?
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e115">The urban agricultural commons I am referring to are not public property, they are
                                       not community property either since they fall outside the scope of both categories.
                                       They are what is built in common for a general interest: the use of fertile agricultural
                                       and gardening land to grow food and fulfil sustainable local functions.

                                       the cultivated land, the crops and livestock produced, and the farmers provide sustainable
                                       urban resources. These resources should not be evicted from the city as that has been
                                       the case during more than a century of hygienic modernism, an ethical principle which
                                       has undoubtedly become obsolete. That is why a more pragmatic approach, which  takes
                                       potential impacts into account, is to be recommended: to ensure that everyone benefits
                                       from the eco-systemic goods provided by a diversified urban agriculture. To choose
                                       and prioritise them, because all eco-systemic supply, regulation and cultivation services
                                       cannot be provided equally to all the inhabitants. Because they are not just consumers
                                       but also inhabitants who want to enjoy a good quality of life in their own environment.

                                       viable. There is a need to invent another model based on the simple notion that all
                                       urban planners and landscape architects are familiar with: the system of parks developed
                                       by Frederick Law Olmsted in the United States and Jean-Claude Nicolas Forestier in
                                       France at the end of the 19th century. An urban agricultural system of public parks
                                       which includes future agricultural and gardening spaces. They are referred to as ecological
                                       networks or, in France, green and aquatic networks (in French: <i>trame verte et aquatique</i>). These parks are designed at the city level following the scientific research in
                                       landscape ecology conducted by Richard Forman and Michel Godron on the conditions
                                       to restore biodiversity. These unbuilt areas provide indispensable eco-systemic functions
                                       for the city: agriculture for food and energy, vegetation to regulate urban microclimates,
                                       the regulation of environmental risks (floods, fire, erosion of biodiversity, pollution
                                       of water tables) and the sequestration in the soil and the vegetation of excess carbon
                                       in the air.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e141">The development of urban agriculture should be associated with policies for ecological
                                       networks and biodiversity as well as other public policies such as those relating
                                       to energy. These practices and policies are being deployed in Europe, but the pace
                                       is slowing due to the need for housing which irreversibly occupies too much valuable
                                       farmland. Is it possible to resort to other than regulatory means to preserve agricultural
                                       land, for instance by revisiting the notion of the common?

                                       cultivation for food and energy along with the cultural values attributed to such
                                       production. That is why the spaces and the tools used in agriculture have never been
                                       res nullius: things belonging to no one, such as the air or the fish in the sea. The
                                       use of land for farming automatically engenders its appropriation as well as that
                                       of its produce, at least during the cultivation or production cycle [<a href="#R06">6</a>].

                                    <p id="d1e154">So much so that in the cases of traditional African societies or of the former European
                                       commons, the land is jointly owned by the community; the modern legal notion of the
                                       individual ownership of land (<i>usus, fructus et abusus</i>) does not apply. It is the representatives of the community who decide on the collective
                                       rules governing the use of the land for crop or livestock farming. In such a context,
                                       which still applies in pastoral societies, the land and its permanent plant cover
                                       is <i>res communis</i>, public domain, a common resource, accessible to the rights holders of the community
                                       (a village, a municipality, an ethnic group). If the rules for the conservation of
                                       natural resources (soil, grass, tree, water) are not respected, the resource is put
                                       at risk and may even disappear: as a result its shared use is jeopardised (this is
                                       the “Tragedy of the Commons” theorised by the American economist Garett Hardin in
                                       the 1960s [<a href="#R10">10</a>]).

                                    <p id="d1e165">In such conditions two solutions are adopted: the land is privatised (<i>res privata</i>) by the sharing of the land between the right holders with or without the enclosure
                                       of the plots (as in the case of the enclosures in England in the 18th century), or
                                       it is made a public property: <i>res publica</i> (by allocating it as a part of the public domain of local authorities).

                                    <p id="d1e173">In the urban environment, collective property may persist as in the case of the commons
                                       in English cities (green, non-agricultural public spaces open to the public). Generally,
                                       unbuilt, wooded, agricultural land or aquatic spaces are either privately owned or
                                       the property of the State. Common lands have practically disappeared from the two
                                       categories defined by economists: public properties (in principle outside the realm
                                       of the market), and properties accessible via the market: property belonging to clubs
                                       (payment of a fee without exclusion) and exclusive private property.

                                    <p id="d1e178">As demonstrated by the economist Elinor Ostrom (1933–2012), it is possible to create
                                       and preserve common resources (the water from water tables—in Los Angeles especially—an
                                       irrigation system, the fish in the sea) and to transmit them in good conditions. Such
                                       rational governance of a resource also applies to unbuilt lands in urban areas. It
                                       mobilises land owners, the users of “natural” soils (farmers, foresters, naturalists)
                                       or artificial soils (hydroponic farms), public authorities, experts, and generally
                                       “the public”, as defined by the American pragmatist philosopher John Dewey (1859–1962).
                                       The governance stakeholders, the “appropriators” and the public authorities, define
                                       the rules for the use of productive public or private agricultural and urban land.
                                       In post-industrial dross and brownfields sites, soils are often polluted. In France,
                                       the creation of community gardens requires a joint project between public authorities
                                       and gardeners [<a href="#R11">11</a>].
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e183">A common is therefore a political principle of deliberation, of co-decision and action.
                                       The things built in common become common to the actor and co-deciders, “that which
                                       is covered by the activity of putting something in common, that which is produced
                                       in common by this activity” [<a href="#R02">2</a>]. This common practice designates things, objects, private or public (the soil and
                                       the plants, farm produce and forestry products), and an awareness of moral values
                                       (justice, solidarity, freedom, dignity, etc.) which are at the basis of collective
                                       deliberation (co-decision). We shall call them agricultural urban commons.

                                       established by a system of territorial governance which emerged in the 1970s as a
                                       result of environmental demands expressed by the inhabitants.

                                    <p id="d1e202">The same thing occurred in the case of the Plaine de Versailles where a surface area
                                       of 2,000 hectares was protected by a territorial governance body composed of the grouping
                                       of municipalities of Versailles Grand Parc, and the association of farmers, elected
                                       representatives, inhabitants and public agencies of the Chateau de Versailles area

                                    <p id="d1e207">When public or private institutions are confronted with the democratic expression
                                       of territorial stakeholders and with the tensions and conflicts caused by competition
                                       between building (housing, commercial zones, leisure areas) and food production, the
                                       ensuing discussions result in the creation of a common. In certain cases, such as
                                       Saclay, associations of consumers take ownership of land with the aim of producing
                                       local organic farm produce. In other areas, such as the Rennes metropolis (West France),
                                       the notion of <i>urban fields</i> designates land open to an agricultural and urban multi-functionality. Common projects
                                       fail, however, if stakeholders do not agree. These agreements often require a lot
                                       of time and are not eternal!

                                    <p id="d1e212">These new commons designate agricultural spaces which are usually private and the
                                       agricultural use of which is decided by, and for, local stakeholders and inhabitants
                                       who support their preservation. These spaces are similar to classic “commons” because
                                       they can be exhausted as a result of urban sprawl, but they are different in that
                                       they are appropriated. It is therefore common action which produces the common and
                                       not the over-abundance or inability to appropriate the resource (such as the air or
                                       the sea). Therefore, a soil, the function and agricultural uses of which fulfil eco-systemic
                                       functions (production, regulation, transmission) recognised as useful by the inhabitants,
                                       becomes a common.

                                    <p id="d1e226">An essential priority for the possible existence of agricultural urban commons is
                                       the conservation of cultivable and wooded land according to geographic continuities.
                                       It starts with the cartographic indication of the desirable use of the land in urban
                                       planning documents. For at least forty years the Ile-de-France region has had an urban
                                       planning policy. Initially it did not cover agricultural spaces, but today it includes
                                       a regional plan for open (unbuilt) agricultural and forestry spaces, which provides
                                       a political framework for the actions of elected representatives in municipalities.
                                       In addition, the policy for regional land use management (in French: <i>Périmètres Régionaux d’Intervention Foncière</i>, PRIF) make it possible for the agency in charge of green spaces (in French: <i>Agence des espaces verts</i>) to buy threatened agricultural land and nature areas. The same applies for all the
                                       municipalities which have had a territorial development master plan for the last ten
                                       years such as the grouping of agglomerations of Montpellier (since 2004).
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e234">Within this legal framework, which is clearly in favour of the general interest (the
                                       shared objective of providing healthy local food), it is very difficult for elected
                                       representatives to prevent the urbanisation of open spaces and advocate for reasoned
                                       agricultural urbanism. What forms of agriculture do urban municipalities need? This
                                       is a second essential issue.

                                    <p id="d1e239">For fifteen years now it has been theoretically possible to build vertical farms or
                                       production units. These essentially use the hydroponic farming model which is perfectly
                                       mastered by horticultural farmers, especially in green houses. Investors, however,
                                       have remained very cautious and so far hardly any vertical constructions have seen
                                       the light of day.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e241">That is why the conventional solution of horizontal farms situated in urban green
                                       areas is far preferable, as seen in a recent project (2009) in Munich,  Germany. These
                                       farms already exist, such as the orchards and large dairy farm of Viltain on the Saclay
                                       Plateau. With a few conditions: compliance with principles guiding ethical ecological
                                       agricultural, and in some cases, local production: animal welfare, limited or proscribed
                                       use of pesticides, organic farming, short farm-to-market cycles, organised access
                                       for the public, etc.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e243">Another condition is that farmers should find in these continuous agricultural spaces
                                       few of the problems that might urge them to move away from cities: problems with the
                                       circulation of farm vehicles and machines on clean roads, problems with sources of
                                       organic matter (livestock, compost), the lack of local technical and veterinary assistance
                                       or of storage buildings and, above all, the possibility of transforming their crops
                                       and produce locally.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e245">A last condition is that in the medium term there should be no uncertainty concerning
                                       the continued use of the land for farming. Farmers investing in agriculture cannot
                                       buy machines and animals, work on fertilising soils and selecting crops and deciding
                                       on which ones to rotate, develop quality produce and gain the confidence of clients
                                       if they have no control over the land through ownership or rental. In this area European
                                       countries have very different legislation which makes it possible to develop the use
                                       of unbuilt lands as commons. For mainly environmental (biodiversity) but also food
                                       production reasons there are private and public land agencies which make it possible
                                       to build urban agricultural and forestry networks. This is the case in France, for
                                       example, with the land development and farming societies (in French: <i>Société d’aménagement foncier et d’établissement agricole</i>, SAFER), or the green space agencies (in French: <i>Agence des espaces verts</i>) in the Ile-de-France region. But all these tools are unable to prevent the consumption
                                       of agricultural land.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e253">The ideal solution would be to ensure that agricultural land and the use of agricultural
                                       urban commons should become as “natural” as urban forests and public parks and gardens
                                       in the minds of everyone. Since such a utopian point of view is not feasible there
                                       is a need for a pragmatic approach: to experiment and evaluate the results with the
                                       inhabitants, elected representatives and farmers, and to improve practises and new
                                       projects for the benefit of all.

                                    <p id="d1e258">So that an agricultural urban environment can actually exist, the political will to
                                       develop and share it with the people concerned is a prerequisite. The urban area of
                                       Rennes in the west of France (400,000 inhabitants) is a fine example. For almost 20
                                       years, its elected representatives have sought to build with urban planners, farmers
                                       and landscape architects an urban agricultural region in the form of an archipelago;
                                       in other words, urban islands localised in a woody landscape of Brittany (in French:
                                       <i>bocage</i>), a network of small towns and a centre linked by road and rail (metro) infrastructures.
                                       This vision of a rural city, or urban countryside, was shared by local politicians
                                       and inhabitants. And farmers are grouped together to sell their livestock and vegetable
                                       produce. The inhabitants of this city live in an urban area in which farming activities
                                       are a part of the urban environment, where urban planners have designed green and
                                       aquatic networks, pedestrian and cycling lanes, and where chambers of agriculture
                                       have supported the development of short cycles to bring produce to market and organised
                                       the production and processing sectors. Tensions subsist, namely in the land property
                                       market, but the notion of an urban agricultural region has become a reality.

                                    <p id="d1e263">Another significant trend has developed during the last thirty years in Europe by
                                       which consumers pick produce directly from the farm, such as in the urban region of
                                       Versailles Grand Parc on the Gally Farm (Figure <a href="#Fig06">6</a>).

                                       operation in Monza, North of Milan. It is the shortest channel to market for produce
                                       where the producer is directly in contact with the consumer and which also provides
                                       a pleasant experience of country life. Initially, crop varieties were limited, but
                                       the variety of cultivated species has considerably increased today, some cases including

                                       urban agricultural activity: greenhouse farming, riding centers, agritourism and bee-keeping
                                       in town.
                                       Sometimes inhabitants are invited to farms to participate in wine harvesting, as in
                                       the North of Montpellier (South France) in a vineyard belonging to the urban community.
                                       Such pleasant activities would be difficult to imagine in sterile vertical farms.

                                       of meeting one’s gardening neighbours, of engaging in a social activity which also

                                       in metropolitan areas, is the notion of self-sufficiency for the most fragile types
                                       of produce such as fresh produce. In order to achieve this in the metropolitan area
                                       of Rennes, all green spaces would probably have to be converted to agriculture which
                                       would not be desirable except in an exceptional circumstance such as a war. Finally,
                                       we must remember that green spaces have often in the past been used to exclude the
                                       use of poor or marginalised populations. Today,  the challenge of the commons is to
                                       build an alternative to the private use of public spaces [<a href="#R12">12</a>].

                              <p id="d1e284">In this new context, to compose or design the agricultural city and to give it new
                                 forms is a challenge for the landscape architects and urban planners of the 21st century.
                                 This practice existed in France when Louis XIV asked the architect Mansart and the
                                 gardener Jean-Baptiste de la Quintinie to install a vegetable garden and orchard of
                                 12 hectares next to his palace in the new town of Versailles. Why not mobilise these
                                 competences again (Figure <a href="#Fig07">7</a>)?
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e289">Why not design an urban agricultural environment with the tools and concepts of landscape
                                 architecture? This would involve showcasing agricultural activities ranging from the
                                 most high-tech to the most traditional, and highlighting and promoting their social,
                                 economic, environmental and cultural benefits. It happens to be the complete opposite
                                 of what was done during the 20th century. This would undoubtedly make it possible
                                 for such activities to be accessible to a majority of the population!
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e291">The sharing of agricultural or garden land and products through a form of territorial
                                 governance is not a utopian dream. However, it is idealistic in that it challenges
                                 the consumer's model of society and notably, the fact of supplying cities by means
                                 of long-distance transport with its repercussions on energy consumption and public
                                 health in a context of increasing food insecurity. And yet, such a notion is realistic
                                 as the examples cited above demonstrate.

                              <p id="d1e293">Utopias like vertical farms are probably chimerical—to bring all the food necessary
                                 for the city dwellers. “Horizontal” urban farming on natural or artificial soils for,
                                 and with consumers, is a better solution.  The notion of the common is a political
                                 principle and a shared duty for stakeholders such as public authorities and associations
                                 as well as private organisations and individuals engaged in the same activity: the
                                 creation and conservation of local farming and gardening activities on cultivated
                                 lands which can be transformed into urban assets.
