            </p>
            <p id="d1e78">Having recently exprienced a UN Ministerial Summit on the Inclusive Green Economy,
               the
               dominant discussions focus upon the neoliberal response to the collective global
               environmental crisis of climate change, biodiversity loss, waste and pollution
               intertwined with the deep social crisis of poverty within the global south. The
               solutions are numerous—mega infrastructure projects focusing on the large-scale
               deployment of renewable energy, the growth of ‘green’ SMEs built around social and
               technical innovation, promoting the circular economy that treats waste as resource,
               and
               the emergence of natural capital accounting systems that document and ‘value’ the
               natural assets of a nation. These mechanisms and processes are the heart and soul
               of the
               new green economy and are designed to promote a ‘low carbon’ future within the context
               of a ‘just transition’. Personally, I too am a convert of this doctrine, a willing
               participant in the frame that modern neoliberal democratic capitalism is a force for
               good that can be harnessed to promote ecological modernisation, the integration of
               ecological, technical and economic forces for sustainability.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e80">Enter the challenge of this book—a literary ‘spanner in the works’ that challenges
               the
               fundamental nature of the green economy and its socio-political positioning as the
               dominant mechanism to deliver a low carbon and green future. As a reviewer, my thoughts
               emerging from this work are of pessimism, doubt and complexity—not in terms of the
               content, which at times is difficult reading, but in terms of the realisation that
               the
               premise of the authors may be correct. The current incremental approach based on
               ecological modernisation may not be enough to radically structure the global economy
               in
               the near term to meet both our climate change and social commitments under Paris and
               the
               2030 Sustainable Development Goals. In fact, as suggested within several chapters,
               some
               of the tenants of the green growth paradigm may serve to widen existing inequalities.
               This is a substantial wake-up call in the context of the growing global response in
               the
               form of the green economy, where the linkages are being made between the global chains
               of globalised large scale financial capital and the sustainability agenda at the expense
               of localised, decentralised participatory responses. As championed within the text,
               a
               paradigm shift is required that addresses the underlying drivers of consumerism and
               profit within the current economic model, and moves to promote equity, dematerialisation
               and sufficiency within society.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e82">The scale of the problem is explored in depth in Part 1. Chapter 1 is one of the most
               compelling reads in the book, detailing the severe nature of the climate crisis and
               how
               today’s political and economic approach is really based on ‘tinkering and tweaking’
               that
               will not achieve the wholesale social and economic change required to meet the latest
               round of climate targets. It articulates that meeting these difficult targets will
               be
               impossible under the current (green) growth paradigm that embeds consumption and
               stimulates infinite growth on a finite planet. Chapter 2 explores the interpretation
               of
               green growth and seeks to critically examine the relationship between ‘green’ and
               ‘growth’. A critical perspective on the privatisation and capitalisation of nature
               is a
               prevalent theme in this chapter (as it is through the book) exploring and critiquing
               the
               notion of ecosystem services and natural capital—a foundation on which much of the
               lore
               of green growth depends. The arguments proceed that green growth represents a
               liberalisation of nature, a conquest followed by monetisation, commercialisation and
               trade. The author contends that a counterrevolution is needed to contest the green
               growth narrative recognising that labour struggles are inherently entwined with
               environmental justice movements. I’m sympathetic to this view as a natural response
               to
               the many years of ‘environmental’ economic monetisation of ecosystem services but
               what
               the book is responding to is the tail end extreme of the movement. It fails to capture
               the essence of what ecosystem services is about, the articulation of our deep connection
               to nature and the variety of benefits we receive from it. The chapter however services
               as a warning—if left unchecked, natural capital could promote the commodification
               and
               trade of ecosystems. A warning best heeded.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e84">Part 2 explores a number of interesting case studies including Korea, Brazil, EU,
               Latin
               America and India. The chapters are well organised and compelling bringing to bear
               the
               underlying arguments that the green growth paradigm is essentially a new and aggressive
               form of capitalism masquerading under environmentalism. I particularly enjoyed the
               chapter on the EU, which articulated the position of the EU as a founder and supporter
               of the green growth concept which is woven into a range of positions including its
               renewable energy and climate targets and the wholesale adoption of market led (and
               market endorsed) policy instruments. The chapter delves into the contested nature
               of
               sustainability in the EU, from the early adoption of the precautionary principle to
               increasing influence and encroachment of business in reducing and limiting EU
               environmental ambitions. Ultimately in the EU, as the chapter points out, green growth
               will flourish and open new markets, new opportunities and new profit-making business
               but
               will ultimately fail to solve the underlying structural problems which are eroding
               Earth’s life support systems.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e86">Part 3 leads the reader through a number of responses to the green growth paradigm
               and a
               set of alternatives for consideration. In my opinion this the most least developed
               part
               of the book and reflects the nature of the debate that while capitalism causes as
               many
               problems as it solves [in green growth] there is a lack of a cohesive, comprehensive
               and
               pragmatic alternatives that can operate at scale. Chapter 11 on Sustainable Energy
               Utilites (SEU) is a case in point. An insightful chapter and a promising approach,
               it
               argues that the fetishism around eco-technologies, the poster child of the
               eco-modernisation agenda, has not resolved many issues facing the world’s poor. The
               green economy approach could potentially widen the gulf between the elite and the
               impoverished by avoiding the grittier issues of social and environmental justice that
               are necessary for societal change. Many energy reforms in the renewable market ‘lock
               in’
               massive infrastructure projects and centralised structures based on generous subsidies
               and supporting policy structures. The outcomes, as noted in the chapter, are to
               reinforce centralised corporate control of energy infrastructure, locking in
               inequalities existing in the social and political system. The advent of the SEU as
               an
               alternative offers an innovative approach for genuine change, emphasising sufficiency,
               decentralisation and energy reduction as its business model, but for the near future,
               it
               operates, as many projects do, as a niche within the capitalist system, relying on
               its
               structures and social norms to survive and thrive. What is needed in Part 3 is further
               ideas to reinforce and drive the large-scale change necessary for genuine sustainable
               societies and mass movements, the spread of these niche innovations in to the mainstream
               and the policies that will be required to support it.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e88">While I am not convinced the book offers much in the way of pragmatic solutions, as
               a
               text it is very effective at identifying the problems within the green growth narrative.
               It holds up a mirror and counter-narrative to the ascendant and dominant paradigm
               on
               green growth that is thriving within the UN, the OECD, the G8 and the World Bank and
               is
               being propagated within national political structures. As a text and a set of ideas,
               this is useful as a way to ultimately change the course of green growth to a footing
               that is based on environmental justice, local democracy and an alternative economic
               path. The goal is not to undermine a lot of the good work that is happening in the
               green
               growth agenda, particularly at the intersection of poverty and environment. What this
               book offers that is useful is an alternative lens to examine the green growth paradigm
               and its problematic trajectory of embedding neoliberal capitalist values and structures
               as the key delivery mechanism for sustainability. This reflects what I see as one
               of the
               takeaway messages from the book, that within the green growth paradigm are extreme
               elements and market forces that have no desire to achieve sustainability. Green Growth:
               Ideology, Political Economy and the Alternatives is an answer to this problem and
               a call
               for action—essential reading for the sustainability practitioner.
