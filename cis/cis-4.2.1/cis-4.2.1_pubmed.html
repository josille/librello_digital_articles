                  <p class="first" id="d1e85">An increasing body of literature explores the role of transnational municipal networks
                     (TMNs) in governing sustainable development. As associations, one key task of TMNs
                     is to represent their members through production and dissemination of information
                     and knowledge concerning municipal action for sustainable development. Case studies,
                     often emphasising best practice, are used by many TMNs to fulfil this task. Nevertheless,
                     despite strong scrutiny concerning the use of case studies in “policy mobilities”
                     research, there have been limited attempts to quantify the ways in which TMNs present
                     and disseminate case studies and, by doing so, generate trends of presence and absence
                     in literature on sustainable development. Assessing patterns of representation for
                     continents, countries, municipalities and themes across nine international case study
                     collections published by ICLEI - Local Governments for Sustainability since 1991,
                     this study responds to this research gap and identifies the presence of “usual suspects”
                     in the ICLEI case study collections, along with notable absentees. By doing so, the
                     study contributes to policy mobilities research and literature on TMNs, by encouraging
                     reflection and further research concerning the representation patterns influencing
                     which municipalities and what topics are presented in discourses on sustainable development.

            <p id="d1e104">This paper explores the role of transnational municipal networks (TMNs) in governing
               for sustainable development, with specific focus on the production and dissemination
               of information and knowledge concerning municipal efforts to increase sustainability.
               Municipalities, it is claimed, play an important role in a transition to sustainable
               development that requires multi-level governance and diverse forms of action [<a href="#R01">1</a>, <a href="#R02">2</a>, <a href="#R03">3</a>]. As such, municipalities have initiated a diverse range of experiments aiming to
               contribute to sustainable development at the local and global level [<a href="#R04">4</a>, <a href="#R05">5</a>]. Various TMNs have been established to provide coordination and support functions
               that may add value to, and help spread knowledge about, the actions of single municipalities
               [<a href="#R06">6</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e125">TMNs are typically associations, organised as networks of members who may pay subscription
               fees and usually receive services in a variety of forms [<a href="#R07">7</a>]. TMNs may address multiple themes or single issues, be formed of particular types
               of municipality, or represent different geographic areas [<a href="#R08">8</a>, <a href="#R09">9</a>]. As such, it is difficult to directly compare TMNs [<a href="#R10">10</a>]. ICLEI - Local Governments for Sustainability (commonly known as ICLEI, and formerly
               known as the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives) has, since
               its foundation in 1990, emerged as a prominent TMN addressing sustainable development
               [<a href="#R11">11</a>, <a href="#R12">12</a>, <a href="#R13">13</a>].
               
            </p>
            <p id="d1e149">ICLEI provides a range of information services aimed at members, stakeholders and
               the general public. This paper focuses on ICLEI’s use of case studies as an information
               tool, assessing the continents, countries, municipalities and themes represented in
               nine collections of case studies. The paper identifies patterns of representation
               across these collections and assesses ways in which the composition of the case study
               collections (i.e. the representation of certain types of activities in particular
               locations) may influence the framing of the practice and study of sustainable development
               in municipalities, and the possible implications of such representation for research
               and practice [<a href="#R14">14</a>]. By doing so, this paper contributes to literature considering the role of materials
               (e.g. publications) in “policy mobilities” [<a href="#R15">15</a>, <a href="#R16">16</a>].

               <!-- named anchor --></a><h2 class="main-title">2.- TMNs: Roles and Functions</h2>
            <p id="d1e163">TMNs are said to help municipalities address local, national and transnational concerns
               by providing services that fulfil local (intra-municipal), horizontal (inter-municipal)
               and vertical functions (national, international) [<a href="#R17">17</a>, <a href="#R18">18</a>]. Kern and Bulkeley [<a href="#R12">12</a>] identify three main characteristics of TMNs: 1) voluntary membership; 2) self-governing
               polycentric and non-hierarchical structures; and, 3) provision of implementation support
               to members (as opposed to the lobbying of conventional non-governmental organisations
               (NGOs)). As such, TMNs often act as mediators and convenors, promoting “governance
               by diffusion” [<a href="#R05">5</a>, <a href="#R19">19</a>, <a href="#R20">20</a>]. TMNs may be seen as a dynamic alternative to traditional forms of government [<a href="#R08">8</a>] or as “quasi-governmental” actors representing conventional interests embedded in
               the international system [<a href="#R17">17</a>]. Giest and Howlett [<a href="#R21">21</a>] argue that TMNs function more effectively when working with the support of national
               governments and when focused on specific geographical regions (cf. [<a href="#R07">7</a>]).
            </p>
            <p id="d1e196">This suggests that the <i>location</i> of TMN activities may be as relevant as the topics or themes that they address. Studies
               by Dolowitz et al. [<a href="#R22">22</a>] support this perspective and downplay the diffusion effects of TMNs, noting that
               the policy searches of municipalities tend not to be systematic but are more often
               based on convenience and geographic proximity. That said, <i>when</i> there is evidence of careful and comprehensive searches, diffusion (or at least learning)
               may be said to occur [<a href="#R23">23</a>]. In order to be representative of their members (and/or constituency group), TMNs
               thus face a challenge to accommodate the interests of both the typical and more ambitious
               municipalities, for whom different types of information and services may be relevant.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e210">Representing members and their interests is a sizeable challenge for TMNs. Various
               authors observe the over-representation of certain cities or categories of cities
               in literature on sustainable development and within TMNs [<a href="#R24">24</a>, <a href="#R25">25</a>, <a href="#R26">26</a>]. In some cases, this may lead to the development of “core-periphery” dynamics influencing
               the operations, activities and thematic focus of TMNs [<a href="#R01">1</a>, <a href="#R07">7</a>, <a href="#R08">8</a>]. On such occasions, prominent and active members may contribute to the consolidation
               or diffusion of particular norms, themes or solutions, or dominate the internal governance
               of TMNs. Given that TMN members only ever account for a fraction of their possible
               constituency, issues or perspectives relevant to the large group of non-members may
               be downplayed or silenced in TMN agendas (indeed, the non-representative nature of
               TMNs, and their overall significance, remains under scrutiny, see e.g. [<a href="#R27">27</a>]). TMNs should thus be careful to avoid representing only “the usual suspects” [<a href="#R08">8</a>, <a href="#R28">28</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e240">An overview of several theoretical frameworks proposed to describe the roles and functions
               of TMNs can be found in Table <a href="#Tab01">1</a>. One task that is common to these frameworks is the production and dissemination
               of information and knowledge, and specifically the communication of best practices
               aiming to facilitate learning for improved sustainability performance. Best or good
               practice has no clearly defined meaning, yet may be assumed to refer to Jänicke and
               Weidner’s definition of “success in comparative terms as best (or nearly best) achievement”
               and thus encompass pioneering, radical and incremental approaches in comparison to
               the status quo ([<a href="#R29">29</a>], pp. 14–15). Nevertheless, McCann and Ward write that “neither success nor failure
               is absolute. One does not make sense without the other” ([<a href="#R30">30</a>], p. 828). The absence of best practices, indeed the absence of a case, may reveal
               and legitimise “attempts to change and embed new policy models” ([<a href="#R30">30</a>], p. 829). There is thus a need to critically assess patterns of presence and absence
               and their implications in collections of materials such as case studies.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e254">Best practices may also play a role in vertical governance, demonstrating “what is
               possible” to national governments, and thereby becoming tools for the advocacy and
               lobbying efforts of TMNs. Similarly, some municipalities use TMNs as platforms when
               aiming to raise their profile for green place branding purposes [<a href="#R31">31</a>, <a href="#R32">32</a>], although this may not be the primary aim of all municipalities in such networks
               [<a href="#R33">33</a>]. Finally, best practice examples may enable benchmarking processes [<a href="#R34">34</a>, <a href="#R35">35</a>]. In this case best practice would contribute to the internal governance of TMNs
               and their rule setting processes, as well as learning in municipalities.

            <p id="d1e360">Although the precise aims of TMNs when disseminating information may vary, various
               TMNs use case studies as an information tool (e.g. C40 Cities, Energie Cités, Eurocities)
               [<a href="#R38">38</a>]. The publication of case studies enables TMNs to fulfil multiple objectives, e.g.
               by sharing information between members and more broadly, to society. Such case studies
               may focus on general issues of relevance to sustainable development, or more specifically
               on activities linked to specific themes that in turn may be linked to associations’
               thematic priorities or financing; case studies may also promote members or be offered
               as an incentive to get non-members to join. Case studies thus act as a functional
               tool for awareness-raising, exchange of ideas and capacity-building. However, recent
               literature has highlighted a number of possible problems with the ways that case studies
               present concepts or information.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e365">For example, many case studies focus on a single action in a specific municipality
               addressing a single theme. This striation of “sustainable development” may risk making
               the concept appear geographically or thematically specific or limited, and thereby
               consolidate isolationist or elitist norms [<a href="#R26">26</a>, <a href="#R39">39</a>, <a href="#R40">40</a>]. For example, some writers (such as [<a href="#R41">41</a>, <a href="#R42">42</a>, <a href="#R43">43</a>, <a href="#R44">44</a>, <a href="#R45">45</a>]) note an imbalance in the presentation of “developed” and “developing” world narratives
               in academic literature, leading to over-representation of cases from Europe and North
               America. Similarly, McFarlane [<a href="#R24">24</a>] and Pierre [<a href="#R46">46</a>] suggest theories of urban governance developed in studies of North American and
               European cities dominate over alternatives. In other words, the frequency, framing
               and form of assessments used by academics may distort understanding of urban contexts
               and result in the presentation of frequently-occurring cases dubbed “usual suspects”
               [<a href="#R28">28</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e401">There are other potential problems with the use of case studies. For example, solutions
               proposed in some case studies may accentuate the problems identified in others [<a href="#R29">29</a>, <a href="#R34">34</a>, <a href="#R47">47</a>, <a href="#R48">48</a>] and context-specific analysis is often developed and presented with limited reference
               to the global challenges that stimulate local action; such lack of performativity
               means that analysis is frequently detached from, or devoid of, meaning [<a href="#R39">39</a>]. Comparison between cases may be difficult because, as even advocates of comparative
               urban research note, comparative analysis depends on “some degree of reductionism
               as a step in preparing empirical observations” ([<a href="#R46">46</a>], p. 447; cf. [<a href="#R14">14</a>]).
            </p>
            <p id="d1e425">Others contend that case studies have limited utility, even when they provide interesting
               information, as the scope and format of case studies tends to limit the amount of
               information that can be provided. Even in a non-comparative format, complex issues,
               such as institutional, political, socio-economic or environmental dimensions, may
               be presented in an overly simplified manner, or even discounted by readers on the
               basis of assumptions about perceived relevance [<a href="#R22">22</a>]. Such perceptions have led to criticisms of municipalities as being “purposefully
               conservative” doing little more than that which they consider practical or convenient
               [<a href="#R35">35</a>, <a href="#R49">49</a>]. Whilst there are not necessarily clear alternatives to the use of case studies,
               McCann and Ward are among the authors stating the need to explore the implications
               of presence and absence in more detail [<a href="#R30">30</a>].
               
            </p>
            <p id="d1e439">In sum, recent works suggests that the over-representation of case studies in academic
               literature on urban sustainability may contribute to an over-representation of certain
               kinds of municipalities, e.g. cities of a certain size or in certain locations—at
               the expense of others. Cities that are not represented, under-represented or less
               visibly active may thus be considered to be either “free riders” or “silenced” in
               debates on sustainable development. Against this background, this article focuses
               on the extent to which different continental regions, countries, municipalities and
               themes are represented in nine collections of international case studies published
               by ICLEI. In particular, the paper investigates a claim made in a major ICLEI publication.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e441">In 2012, ICLEI published the global review “Local Sustainability 2012: taking stock
               and moving forward” [<a href="#R50">50</a>]. As a complement to the review, a compendium of case studies, “Showcasing progress”,
               was also published. “Showcasing progress” included short versions of 14 case studies
               in the main ICLEI Case Study series. ICLEI was keen to stress that the featured case
               studies were “not the usual suspects”, suggesting their awareness that some case studies
               perhaps risk becoming too familiar, repetitive or informative due to their frequent
               appearance in collections [<a href="#R28">28</a>]. How well does ICLEI’s claim stand up? Did the compendium feature a new group of
               municipalities? Or did the “usual suspects” reappear? By illustrating patterns of
               representation, the article will explore if “usual suspects” exist in this report
               and across ICLEI’s collections of case studies, and consider the implications of such
               occurrences for both theory and practice.

               <p id="d1e455">In September 2015, ICLEI celebrated the 25th anniversary of its foundation. A short
                  history of ICLEI follows (cf. [<a href="#R51">51</a>]). In 1989, 35 local government leaders from North America met and pledged to establish
                  local regulations to phase out the use of ozone-depleting chemicals. At this meeting,
                  “Larry Agran, Mayor of Irvine, California, USA and Jeb Brugmann imagined an agency
                  that could coordinate local government responses to global environmental problems”
                  [<a href="#R52">52</a>]. An international consultation with local government officials was held, and in
                  September 1990, more than 200 local governments from 43 countries attended the World
                  Congress of Local Governments for a Sustainable Future. The Congress concluded with
                  foundation of the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI)
                  and adoption of ICLEI Charter [<a href="#R52">52</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e466">Operations began in March 1991, with the basic organisational structure of ICLEI being
                  established: ICLEI World Secretariat, hosted by the City of Toronto, Canada, and a
                  European Secretariat in Freiburg, Germany, opened. This world-regional structure has
                  developed over time and today, ICLEI maintains eight regional Secretariats and four
                  national offices [<a href="#R53">53</a>]. ICLEI regions broadly correlate with the UN Geoscheme of regions and sub-regions,
                  which is used for statistical purposes in the international system. Since 2010, ICLEI
                  World Secretariat has been hosted by the City of Bonn, Germany, with six thematic
                  centres located at offices around the world [<a href="#R54">54</a>]. The thematic centres partly reflect the widening and deepening of ICLEI’s mandate
                  and activities over time, as did the formal change in the organisation’s name made
                  in 2003, when ICLEI became ICLEI - Local Governments for Sustainability. Recent years
                  have also seen an increase in ICLEI membership. In 2006, New Delhi became the 500th
                  active ICLEI member, and by November 2008, membership doubled when Mumbai joined.
                  There are presently around 1000 active members of ICLEI in over 80 countries.

               <p id="d1e477">ICLEI defines itself as having a triple role: as an association of municipalities,
                  a movement of municipalities, and an agency for municipalities. In other words, ICLEI
                  provides a forum for members to meet and represents its members in other arena (e.g.
                  UNCSD, UNFCCC), whilst initiating and participating in actions to raise awareness
                  or increase capacity of municipalities and other stakeholders. The broad and multi-dimensional
                  role of ICLEI is realised through a variety of initiatives, including campaigns, projects,
                  alliances and awareness-raising activities including conferences.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e479">For example, at the UN Conference on Environment and Development in 1992, ICLEI proposed
                  the Local Agenda 21 initiative, which subsequently developed into a significant conceptual
                  and practical tool for municipalities to frame and develop their work around environmental
                  issues. Similarly, the Cities for Climate Protection Campaign (CCP), launched at the
                  First Municipal Leaders Summit on Climate Change in 1993, subsequently developed into
                  a significant reference point for municipal work on climate change [<a href="#R55">55</a>]. ICLEI also plays a central role in a number of other initiatives, such as the European
                  Sustainable Cities and Towns Campaign, and the EcoMobility Alliance.

               <p id="d1e487">Dissemination of information occurs on multiple levels and using a variety of means.
                  ICLEI has a global website, plus dedicated websites for different continental regions,
                  national offices, initiatives, alliances, projects and conferences. Dissemination
                  actions include regular newsletters, e-newsletters, conference publications, books,
                  reports, manuals, training guides, and case studies. Dissemination of information
                  has multiple objectives, such as providing information on ICLEI as an organisation;
                  fulfilling associative needs by representing members; or awareness-raising or promotion
                  of past or ongoing actions by ICLEI or its members.

               <p id="d1e492">Since its inception, ICLEI has published case studies in various series that are both
                  international and national/regional in scope. The publication of case studies and
                  promotion of particular practices suggests a willingness to influence other municipalities
                  and promote replication (in appropriate contexts) of the described approach. Interest
                  is generated by describing an approach that is considered singular or unique, innovative
                  or successful, implying a normative evaluation of case studies as “good” or “best”
                  practices [<a href="#R56">56</a>]. ICLEI case studies aim to present best practice in its local context, by describing
                  a project and its results; identifying lessons learned; and assessing the “replication
                  potential” and costs of a project [<a href="#R57">57</a>, <a href="#R58">58</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e503">Case studies may represent the experiences of member municipalities or ICLEI initiatives
                  to specific or general audiences; highlight specific themes or topics (advocacy);
                  or support capacity-building by illustrating particular methods, ideas or processes.
                  For example, the main ICLEI Case Study series, issued by ICLEI World Secretariat,
                  addresses international municipal efforts for sustainable development across multiple
                  themes. In contrast, ICLEI Oceania Water Campaign case study series presents thematic
                  information with exclusive focus on the Oceania region. Other case study collections
                  have been published in relation to specific international or regional projects or
                  initiatives (e.g. [<a href="#R56">56</a>, <a href="#R59">59</a>]).

               <p id="d1e517">In early 2013, ICLEI launched a new global website (www.iclei.org). This replaced
                  the previous website, which was archived at (http://archive.iclei.org). The archived
                  website remains online, although many of the internal links no longer function. On
                  the old website, ICLEI displayed its publications in the section “ICLEI Publications”.
                  There were five categories, each of which contained sub-sets of publications with
                  varying themes, purposes or target groups. These categories were: ICLEI Case Studies;
                  ICLEI Briefing Sheets; ICLEI Papers; ICLEI Global Reports; and, ICLEI Annual Reports.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e519">On 21 February 2013, unaware of ICLEI’s intention to archive the website, the researchers
                  downloaded all ICLEI case studies. A subsequent check ensured no further publications
                  were added prior to archiving, meaning the downloaded files may be said to provide
                  a complete and accurate record for the period from ICLEI’s foundation up until the
                  end of February 2013. Case studies published during 2013–2015 have subsequently been
                  downloaded from the new website, providing an almost complete record of ICLEI case
                  studies and enabling assessment of the collections’ development over time. It is possible
                  that other documents relevant to the study but unavailable on the website exist in
                  other forms or locations, e.g. as paper copies, or in collections not mentioned on
                  the Publications page. However, notwithstanding this uncertainty, it may be reasonably
                  inferred that the case study collections used as the empirical data for this study
                  are representative and likely to provide interesting insights into the ways in which
                  municipal work for issues concerning sustainable development are portrayed by this
                  particular TMN.

                           up to the end of 2015, by including material from the old website rchive.iclei.org
                           and (for the period 2013–2015) the new iclei.org.

                           global and continental/regional. As such, some, but not all, ICLEI regional Secretariats
                           issues case study collections that focus exclusively on their member countries. Including
                           such collections would thus distort the balance of this study. The second choice thus
                           limits the scope of the case study collections assessed in this study to those that
                           are international in scope, as opposed to collections primarily defined by their geographic
                           or thematic limitations. However, this second choice necessitates a third choice.

                        <p id="d1e540">Make limited analysis of the thematic content of case studies. By including both the
                           main ICLEI Case Study series (which may cover any theme under the umbrella of sustainable
                           development) and other collections that are thematic or project-related yet international
                           in scope, the ability to draw conclusions concerning thematic focus is likely to be
                           skewed somewhat in favour of the themes addressed in such collections.
                        </p>

               </div>
               <p id="d1e542">In other words, it is possible to be quite categorical about data concerning continents,
                  countries and cities, whereas the study of themes or topics addressed in case studies
                  necessarily implies some degree of interpretation and subjectivity, in the sense that
                  themes or topics may overlap, or there may be discrepancies between words and content
                  within or between case studies. It is not possible to be quite so categorical. Thus,
                  to clarify, the thematic results presented in this study have been developed in the
                  following way.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e544">First, the key words from the titles of case studies have been added to the main data
                  sheet (see below) in which empirical data are stored. Key words are verbs, adjectives
                  or nouns that influence the composition of the title and its emphasis. To ensure data
                  was collected from all studies, in the absence of a clear title this information was
                  extracted from the case study’s summary or abstract. In the same way, approximations
                  or synonyms were used to simplify data collection. As such, the thematic analysis
                  provides a reasonably good overview of the thematic focus of case studies, but little
                  information about the content of studies. The thematic data are indicative and should
                  only be interpreted as such. Deeper review or content analysis would be required to
                  make any larger claims concerning its significance or the evidence of trends, etc.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e546">In addition, it should be noted that the collections do not only present municipal
                  examples. A small number of other sub-national entities such as counties, regions
                  or states are represented, as are several national initiatives (e.g. from Mexico,
                  Norway and India), one company (from the USA), and ICLEI CCP campaign. There is also
                  a risk that municipalities represented for specific actions in the main ICLEI Case
                  Study series reappear in the other collections (i.e. that the main topic of a case
                  study is repeated across collections). Ultimately, the main focus of this paper is
                  not to provide methodological certainty about such issues, but rather to identify
                  the frequency at which municipalities are represented in international collections
                  and illustrate general trends concerning themes.

                  Studies focusing on the Americas account for the largest share, with 115 studies,
                  and Europe has the largest share for a single continental region.

                  studies has increased for all regions over time (in the case of North America, due
                  to a significant number of new studies published during 2015). In particular, the
                  portrayal of case studies from Asia and Europe has increased rapidly during the second
                  period. A detailed breakdown per country is provided in Figure <a href="#Fig03">3</a>, which illustrates patterns of representation per continental region and identifies

                  <p id="d1e747">During the first period, case studies from six African countries were represented
                     in the collections, including one study from Senegal in West Africa, a Francophone
                     nation. This example stands out, being the only such case during the two periods.
                     Indeed, despite an overall, if small, increase in the number of studies on African
                     examples during the second period, fewer African countries are represented in this
                     period. South Africa emerges as the dominant subject of case studies. During both
                     periods, there are no examples from Northern Africa, the Sahara or the Horn, including
                     populous countries such as Nigeria, Ethiopia, Egypt or DR Congo. South Africa is,
                     of course, a fairly urbanised nation, yet so too are nations such as Algeria, Libya,
                     or Tunisia. It is thus interesting to consider why the presentation of “Africa” in
                     ICLEI case study collections has increasingly come to mean Anglophone, Southern (South)
                     Africa.

                  <p id="d1e752">The Asian continent has the largest share of the world’s population and in recent
                     decades has been subject to rapid urbanisation. It is thus no surprise that there
                     was an increase in studies on Asian nations over time. In particular, examples from
                     India and Japan were the subject of a large number of case studies, particularly compared
                     to the first period. Perhaps surprisingly, China—with its large population and economy,
                     significant environmental challenges, and rapid urbanisation—is not so well represented,
                     although several other populous countries in the region, such as Iran, Pakistan and
                     Vietnam are not subjects of any case studies. Interestingly, South Korea, as host
                     to ICLEI offices, receives no more representation than Thailand. No countries from
                     Central Asia are represented in case studies.

                  <p id="d1e757">The pattern of representation in case studies for European countries was fairly consistent,
                     albeit with increased volume and diversity after 2002. However, few examples from
                     former-Soviet countries are recorded as case studies, and together, Germany and Sweden
                     account for 47% of all European case studies. In the case of Germany this is perhaps
                     unsurprising as the country has Europe’s largest population and economy and a long
                     history of environmental engagement. Moreover, ICLEI’s European Secretariat has been
                     located in Freiburg since 1991, and since 2010, the World Secretariat has been based
                     in Bonn.
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e759">However, the number of Swedish examples may appear, given the country’s size, surprising,
                     despite the country’s history with Local Agenda 21 and its other efforts to increase
                     sustainability. The Swedish share perhaps reflects the strong degree of municipal
                     autonomy and resource base of Swedish municipalities [<a href="#R60">60</a>, <a href="#R61">61</a>]. It may also be influenced by resources of those seeking to access (and produce)
                     information, in that some forms of policy search and information collection (e.g.
                     search engines) may favour examples that are (a) already disseminated, (b) documented,
                     and (c) in English. Many Swedish municipalities have, over a long period of time,
                     successfully managed to document and disseminate their experiences in English to wide
                     audiences via Internet.

                     in the case study collections. Two things are immediately obvious about the results:
                     first, that Mexico is the only country from Central America and the Caribbean with
                     case studies in the collection; and second, the reduction in examples from the USA
                     during the second period (offset by seven publications during 2015). Indeed, Canadian
                     municipalities are the subject of almost as many case studies as US municipalities
                     since 2002. This may reflect a number of issues, e.g. US domestic politics (although
                     some would argue Canadian politics with regard to environmental issues has not been
                     dissimilar); an increase in the availability of other platforms (e.g. the US Conference
                     of Mayors); or the strong role of Canadian municipalities in ICLEI, with Toronto hosting
                     the World Secretariat from 1991-2010, Edmonton hosting the 2009 World Congress, and
                     with Canadian representatives on ICLEI’s Executive Committee.

                     no surprise that Australian examples also dominate the Oceanian share in other collections
                     too. One example from New Zealand is present, yet no examples from other countries
                     are included. Both Australia and New Zealand have significant urban hubs and strong
                     local government systems; this may not be the case for all countries in the Oceania
                     region.

                     of Africa, in the sense that volume increases in the second period whilst diversity
                     does not. Portuguese-speaking Brazil dominates the collection, and within Brazil,
                     the examples of Belo Horizonte (host to ICLEI’s 2012 World Congress) and Betim from
                     the State of Minas Gerais account for 32% of the national total (and 22% of the South

               <p id="d1e806">The significant share of two Brazilian cities from one State in their national and
                  continental region totals highlights the need to delve deeper into the issue of specific
                  case representation.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e808">As previously stated, the majority of the case studies portray municipal examples.
                  Of the 298 case studies assessed in this sample, 144 case studies (48%) present examples
                  appearing only once in the collections, whereas the remaining 154 case studies (52%)
                  present examples from 52 frequently occurring municipalities. This means that, in
                  total, 196 municipalities and/or other actors are represented by the case study collections.
                  Of these, the 52 frequently occurring municipalities represent around 25% of the examples,
                  yet over half the total number of case studies.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e810">In the following section, the composition of the 154 multiple cases will be assessed.
                  Europe (47.5), South America (40) and North America (31) have the largest number of
                  cases, followed by Asia (23.5), Africa (10), and Oceania (2). There are no multiple
                  cases from Central America. The share of multiple case studies in each continental
                  region’s total varies considerably (see Figure <a href="#Fig04">4</a>). This measure reveals the relative diversity of the case studies represented per
                  continental region.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e815">The same data can be used to show the share multiple case studies in each continental
                  region have in the total 298 case studies. Figure <a href="#Fig05">5</a> shows that multiple case studies from Europe (16%) and South America (13%) account
                  for 29% of all case studies. Together with North America (10%), multiple case studies
                  from these three continental regions account for 39% of all studies. In other words,
                  specific municipalities from these continental regions are represented so frequently
                  that their combined total is greater than that of the combined total for all case
                  studies from Africa, Asia, Central America, the Middle East and Oceania combined (35%).
                  Likewise, the total is greater than that for the combined total of single examples
                  (i.e. those appearing only once) from Europe, North America and South America.
                  
               </p>
               <p id="d1e820">The significant variation in the representation of countries is also noticeable when
                  looking exclusively at multiple case studies. The countries named in Figure <a href="#Fig06">6</a> account for 79% of multiple case studies and approximately 41% of all studies.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e825">Following on from this data, Figure <a href="#Fig07">7</a> reveals the municipalities which are most frequently represented in the case study
                  collections, i.e. the multiples. These are all represented in the countries named
                  in Figure <a href="#Fig06">6</a>, and it is perhaps no surprise that the three of the six most-represented municipalities
                  are located in Brazil.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e833">The 23 municipalities in Figure <a href="#Fig07">7</a> account for 62% of the 154 multiple case studies, or 32% of all 298 studies. 18 of
                  the 23 municipalities are located in Europe, North America and South America; there
                  are no Central American, Middle Eastern or Oceanic examples.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e838">The prominence of these municipalities may have various causes and it is possible
                  to speculate about possible implications of these choices. It could be that these
                  cases were or are judged, according to some criteria or purely subjective terms, to
                  be the most relevant, successful, innovative, etc. However, other criteria may have
                  played a role, e.g. participation in ICLEI projects, status as an ICLEI host city
                  (Freiburg, São Paulo, Toronto), host to ICLEI World Congresses (Belo Horizonte, Cape
                  Town, Edmonton), or other roles in ICLEI (e.g. representative in Executive Committee).
                  As ICLEI is a membership organisation, it would be surprising if there were no such
                  effects. Indeed, such representation is an important function of the organisation.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e840">Municipalities of different sizes and population are represented in Figure <a href="#Fig07">7</a>. The megacities of São Paulo and Seoul and Calvià, a small town of around 50,000
                  inhabitants on the island of Mallorca, are obvious outliers in terms of size, although
                  there are no smaller (i.e. village/rural) municipalities. Sixteen of the municipalities
                  in Figure <a href="#Fig07">7</a> have populations in the range of approximately 400,000 to 5,000,000, accounting for
                  72% of studies on these 23 municipalities, and 23% of all studies. (The municipalities
                  featured in Figure <a href="#Fig07">7</a> that are exception to this are Calvià, Freiburg, Helsingborg, São Paulo, Shimla,
                  Seoul and Växjö). In other words, 16 municipalities account for almost one quarter
                  of all ICLEI case studies on sustainable development at the local level. The 12 most-represented
                  municipalities feature in 63 studies, 41% of multiples and 21% of the total collection.

               <p id="d1e856">A number of verbs and adjectives are deployed when constructing titles. Those that

                  (17), “Implementing/action” (15), “Managing” (15), and “Integrated/integration” (15).
                  11 studies referred to “leadership/best” but only 3 mentioned “ambition”. Of other
                  categories, 3 mentioned “fighting/combating” and 3 “benefiting”. The use of such words
                  seems to imply an emphasis on participation and awareness-raising, strategic management,
                  and actions to reduce negative impacts.

            <p id="d1e920">The exploration of ICLEI’s case study collections provides valuable insights into
               the patterns of representation that emerge when TMNs disseminate best practices. Moreover,
               by testing ICLEI’s claim that the case studies presented in a 2012 report were “not
               the usual suspects” [<a href="#R28">28</a>], it is possible to both substantiate and refute their claim. Seven of the case studies
               featured in “Showcasing progress” involved municipalities (and a national programme)
               that had not previously been included in the nine case study collections assessed
               in this study.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e925">However, seven case studies did present examples from municipalities already featured
               in the nine collections. Two of these municipalities (Iida and Reykjavik) had only
               previously featured in one collection (Climate Roadmap), but five municipalities had
               featured on multiple occasions: Betim (6.5 other studies), Cape Town (2 other studies),
               Ethekwini (Durban), Portland, and Toronto (each 3 other studies). The last three municipalities
               have subsequently appeared in a total of five more studies and must therefore be considered
               to be very much the usual suspects. In contrast, only one (Thane, India) of the “unusual”
               suspects included in the 2012 report has subsequently been the subject of a new case
               study. This indicates that although the overall number of municipalities represented
               in the collections has increased, some of the “usual suspects” have consolidated their
               position (indeed, Belo Horizonte is the study of another case study published in 2016).
               
            </p>
            <p id="d1e927">This tends to underline the validity of claims that certain kinds of municipalities
               appear more frequently than others in discussions on sustainable development. The
               author do not take the view that such imbalances arise from any particular biases
               or wilful distortions, but are more likely to offer insights into limitations to ICLEI’s
               organisational resources and capacities, conditions of project financing, or lack
               of knowledge or information about alternative possible cases. Municipalities that
               have been engaged in ICLEI’s work in an active way, over a long period of time, may
               feature more prominently.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e929">Nonetheless, the financial resources and administrative capacity of municipalities
               may also play an important role in determining who are the subject of case studies.
               Municipalities with limited resources or capacity are unlikely to have time to invest
               in working collaboratively on the content of a case study. These findings indicate
               that TMNs such as ICLEI may need to make a more determined effort to address absences
               in collections, or adopt clearer criteria for case selection in order to justify presence.
               There are not necessarily inherent reasons why repetition of examples is problematic
               (indeed, such repetition may highlight progress or stagnation over time); nevertheless,
               there is a need to be explicit about why selections are made and disseminated.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e931">Some authors cite unequal access to resources as a key determinant of power relationships
               (see e.g. [<a href="#R62">62</a>]), but such arguments will not be explored here, as the results of this paper provide
               only superficial evidence for such claims. Nevertheless, the results do highlight
               a number of interesting points, which may support or refute different theoretical
               claims about the use of case studies. For example, the results suggest some degree
               of ethnocentrism, or at least a lack of plurality, in line with the claims made by
               authors such as [<a href="#R40">40</a>, <a href="#R41">41</a>, <a href="#R42">42</a>, <a href="#R43">43</a>]. This should not be interpreted as a criticism of ICLEI, as 51 countries are featured
               in the nine collections, and there is no inherent reason for any or all countries
               to be included, just as there is no clear way of evaluating which particular municipality
               should be considered the most appropriate for any given case study, or indeed if practices
               in one context may or may not be diffused to other contexts.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e948">However, the issue is worthy of discussion. The majority of case studies in the nine
               collections present examples from Europe and the Americas, at the expense of other
               continental regions. Moreover, a lack of plurality is observed within Europe (i.e.
               few former-Soviet countries) and the Americas (i.e. few Central American or Caribbean
               countries, overwhelming emphasis on Brazil, Canada and USA). The reasons for this
               are unclear, perhaps reflecting resources, history, specific themes or roles within
               ICLEI. Similarly, Oceania appears to be a synonym for Australia (and New Zealand),
               and examples from vast tracts of Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia are absent
               from the collections. Within North America, another trend is the declining number
               of case studies addressing the USA in the second period of the study (a trend masked
               only by a flurry of case studies issued in 2015). Again, a number of inferences may
               be made about this, some of which may appear oppositional e.g. an increased scepticism
               on the part of the USA concerning environmental issues, or an increased concern, leading
               to national initiatives on sustainability issues, such as that spearheaded by the
               US Conference of Mayors.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e950">The population size of countries appears to play a limited role in determining the
               subjects of case studies. Various populous countries are not represented at all (e.g.
               Nigeria, Pakistan, Russia), while others (e.g. Bangladesh, China) are seldom featured.
               Nonetheless, frequently-represented examples tend to come from medium-large municipalities
               (with an interest in green branding, see e.g. [<a href="#R32">32</a>]), with megacities and small municipalities less frequently represented. Again, it
               is only possible to speculate at the reasons for this, which may include resources,
               languages and the linguistic capacity of ICLEI staff in different continental regions,
               or perhaps a lack of political organisation or perceptions concerning the limited
               relevance of the sustainable development agenda (and lack of potential studies) in
               some contexts. It is also entirely possible that municipalities in some regions are
               active in other municipal associations or disseminate information about their work
               in other ways (e.g. through initiatives such as “Villes Durables” of the International
               Organisation of La Francophonie or equivalent networks). This does not preclude the
               importance of scrutinising representation in ICLEI collections, but rather emphasises
               the need for further research of this kind.

            <p id="d1e958">This paper aimed to assess the ways in which the composition of ICLEI case study collections
               may influence the framing of the practice and study of sustainable development in
               municipalities. More specifically, by identifying the patterns of representation in
               the collections, the paper aimed to identify whether any “usual suspects” are obvious
               in ICLEI’s case study collections. The results of this study suggest that there is
               evidence of both over- and under-representation of continental regions, countries
               and themes in the nine international case study collections published by ICLEI. Moreover,
               a number of municipalities from a small number of countries emerge as “usual suspects”
               in the collections. This underlines the importance of theoretical claims concerning
               the risks of imbalances when using case studies to portray municipal work for sustainable
               development and the need to reflect on the implications of presence and absence in
               framing sustainable development.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e960">Future research could add to understanding by deepening the study. For example, content
               or discourse analysis could be used to assess the actual content of case studies.
               An alternative variation would be to consider the membership status of case study
               subjects and attempt to investigate whether membership/insider status influences the
               selection of case study subjects. Another approach would be to widen the study and
               contrast the composition of ICLEI collections with similar collections published by
               other municipal networks, or to complement the study by contrasting the overall composition
               of associations’ literature with that of academic literature or other interest organisations.
               Alternatively, a study of “invisible” or absent municipalities operating outside of
               TMNs could improve understanding of their actions, thereby making a significant contribution
               to literature on municipalities and TMNs.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e962">In sum, this study provides insight into a core function of TMNs, the production and
               dissemination of information, knowledge and best practice. A significant body of literature
               has explored the role of TMNs in capacity-building and evaluation, as representatives
               of municipalities in the international system, and the case studies and practices
               of specific municipalities. However, to date, there has been limited discussion or
               quantification of the ways in which TMNs present and disseminate information and in
               doing so, generate representational trends that emphasise “usual suspects” and avoid
               discussion of others.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e964">The case of ICLEI illustrates this point, yet a wider study including other TMNs and
               case study collections would perhaps result in a similar conclusion. Indeed, the presence
               of “usual suspects” may not necessarily be entirely negative. The point is, there
               is a clear need to improve our understanding of who the “usual suspects” are or are
               not. Such understanding would assist in understanding the appropriateness of using
               such cases as illustrations of different phenomena, and may well promote an increase
               in the diversity of examples in case studies on urban sustainability published by
               TMNs and scholars. Moreover, understanding the representation patterns influencing
               <i>which</i> municipalities and <i>what</i> topics are presented in discourses may also contribute to scientific understanding
               of other processes, such as the role of non-state actors in climate governance. These
               issues are worthy of exploration in future research.
