                              decades. The present contribution focuses on how the relationship between these two
                              entities has developed, highlighting how it corresponds to a growing complexity and
                              interdependence among the two. Awareness has increased that to the extent that proper
                              management of these interdependences can contribute to solve problems, increase economic
                              performance and also make a contribution to a higher quality of life in and around
                              urban areas. In this framework, green infrastructures and agriculture practices in
                              urban areas are discussed. The contribution concludes by suggesting strategies and
                              actions for the proper implementation of green infrastructures and urban agriculture
                              practices at regional and local scales.

                              <p id="d1e95">The existence of urban-rural relationships implies that there is an “urban” dimension
                                 and a “rural” dimension. The characteristics and functions of each given context determine
                                 their interrelationships. We can actually define urban-rural relationships in terms
                                 of “structural” and “functional” relationships. Structural relationships are determined
                                 by how the physical environment is constituted and shaped, while functional relationships
                                 are determined by how the physical environment is utilized. Over time, particular
                                 functions and structures change as production, consumption, and behavior patterns
                                 change, with the effect that the physical environment is also constantly being redefined.
                                 From this point of view, all urban-rural relationships are part of a continuous reshaping
                                 process. It is generally possible to identify two distinct phases in the evolution
                                 of urban-rural relationships. The first phase occurred when societies were predominantly
                                 rural and city-rural relationships were characterized by the consumption of agricultural
                                 products by urban dwellers in exchange for cities' commercial products and services.
                                 In the second phase, the balance of urban-rural relationships began to shift towards
                                 an increasing dependency of rural areas on urban economies and dynamics. New urban-rural
                                 relationships became much more complex than traditional ones. Urban-rural linkages
                                 are now moving beyond single one-way exchanges and demonstrate a more complex and
                                 dynamic network of interdependencies. Moreover, urban problems are sometimes located
                                 in rural areas and vice versa, but solutions to urban problems can also be found in
                                 rural areas as well as in urban ones. This raises the question as to whether a proper
                                 management of the urban-rural relationship can contribute to the sustainability transition,
                                 by solving problems and conflicts, increasing economic performances and improving
                                 the quality of life in, and around urban areas.
                                 In this way, from a methodological point of view, comes into play an incremental approach
                                 based on three specific objectives:

                              <p id="d1e110">The dire ecological, economic, and social crisis of recent years has strongly called
                                 into question the prevailing model of development. There are two main direct consequences
                                 of inappropriate land management: a progressive consumption of essential natural resources
                                 on the one hand and the abandonment and depopulation of the most marginal areas on
                                 the other, which significantly impacts the safety of the territory, the environmental
                                 balance, and the quality of life of communities. The condition of the city, and the
                                 quality of life of its inhabitants, is increasingly becoming a subject of attention.
                                 More than 50% of the world's population now lives in urban areas, so this is where
                                 the real challenge of sustainability and better quality of life has to play out. At
                                 this time, however, the positive outcomes of these challenges still seem to be far
                                 from reality. The reduction of open spaces and the consequent increase of impermeable
                                 surfaces, air pollution, poor water quality, traffic congestion, and the increasing
                                 “heat island” effect, are the urban discomfort and causes of the contemporary crisis
                                 of the city

                                 . In this sense, many international organizations (starting with the Population Division
                                 of the United Nations) have sounded alarms regarding the future of cities. More than
                                 70% of greenhouse gas emissions in the world come from cities 
                                 [

                                 , which continue to grow in an uncontrolled way and become ever more unlivable, in
                                 addition to consuming more and more energy. The signs of this growing discomfort are
                                 manifest in the degradation of the urban landscape and the poor quality of life, and
                                 the continuous expansion of the city, that has increasingly projected toward the outside

                                 opportunity for growth instead of a limit. As a result of this change, the city has
                                 also lost its own identity and sense of place

                                 individual subjectivity is opposed to collective dynamics. People tend to model their
                                 surrounding space according to their own measure, with individual achievements most
                                 of the time more replicated than planned; places for leisure and free time are losing
                                 space because of the contiguity and/or overlapping of different uses and functions;
                                 the city becomes a patchwork of everyone's space, with no flexibility of uses

                                 effects. The variety of types of green areas and environments, and the diversity of
                                 species and combination of plants, make the local habitat more attractive for different
                                 birds, insects and small animals, improving the biodiversity of the city and therefore
                                 also increasing the accessibility to nature and different experiences to people. The

                                       the definition of sustainable development, begins with human needs: “Sustainable development
                                       meets the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future
                                       generations to meet their own needs”, and the World Commission on Environment and
                                       Development (WECD) further defines sustainable development as: “A global process development
                                       that minimizes the use of environmental resources and reduces the impact on environmental
                                       sinks using processes that simultaneously improve economy and the quality of life”.“Sustainability
                                       is the continuation of the quality of life for generations to come including the proper
                                       distribution of quality of life between groups and with other parts of the world”

                                       . So, the very concept of sustainable development emphasizes the maintenance of natural
                                       resources and the natural environment as a prerequisite for developing any economic
                                       activity to achieve human well-being and quality of life. Economic activities are
                                       the means to utilize these resources and to release their potential value to society
                                       in order to meet human needs. A healthy environment and the wise use of natural resources
                                       are indispensable for sustainable development which provides the basis for long-term
                                       quality of life

                                       agri-farming) to be exploited in relation to the need to supply public services and
                                       products for the city

                                       . The role of urban agriculture practices and related activities can actually be articulated
                                       on the basis of the spatial context within which they are implemented. Whether they
                                       are undertaken within small/medium towns or within large cities, their role and contribution
                                       to the social, economic and physical context is different, as is also the perception
                                       by the local population. Within large cities and metropolitan areas, urban agriculture
                                       practices are used for physical urban regeneration, land conservation, and residents
                                       leisure activities (see as examples the cases of large cities, such as Milan, London,
                                       or Paris with their plan for Green Infrastructures, Community Gardens, or Feeding
                                       the City programmes). The situation is different for small centres. The demand for
                                       ”rurality” decreases with increasing potential and actual accessibility to rural areas.
                                       In such cases, their role is strictly and directly linked to the creation of opportunities
                                       for tackling decline and deprivation of the local economy (see as example, The Italian
                                       Strategy for Inner Areas, or the Community Economic Development strategy for US rural
                                       and small town). The community and neighborhood scale, therefore, plays a fundamental
                                       role in creating a sense of identity and community cohesion, which is necessary for
                                       the success of initiatives of this nature

                                       The phenomenon of local “allotments” for personal farming dates back to the 1800s
                                       on national level. The multi-faceted character of urban agriculture (and the food
                                       system in general) has profound effects on many sectors, including public health,

                                       justice, etc. Across the country, in at least 20 cities that have experienced industrial
                                       decline, planning policies have been focused on reuse and regeneration projects for
                                       food-growing activities. As a consequence, derelict land has been substituted by green
                                       infrastructures and city farm projects
