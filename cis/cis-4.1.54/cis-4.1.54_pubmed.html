            <p id="d1e95">The existence of urban-rural relationships implies that there is an “urban” dimension
               and a “rural” dimension. The characteristics and functions of each given context determine
               their interrelationships. We can actually define urban-rural relationships in terms
               of “structural” and “functional” relationships. Structural relationships are determined
               by how the physical environment is constituted and shaped, while functional relationships
               are determined by how the physical environment is utilized. Over time, particular
               functions and structures change as production, consumption, and behavior patterns
               change, with the effect that the physical environment is also constantly being redefined.
               From this point of view, all urban-rural relationships are part of a continuous reshaping
               process. It is generally possible to identify two distinct phases in the evolution
               of urban-rural relationships. The first phase occurred when societies were predominantly
               rural and city-rural relationships were characterized by the consumption of agricultural
               products by urban dwellers in exchange for cities' commercial products and services.
               In the second phase, the balance of urban-rural relationships began to shift towards
               an increasing dependency of rural areas on urban economies and dynamics. New urban-rural
               relationships became much more complex than traditional ones. Urban-rural linkages
               are now moving beyond single one-way exchanges and demonstrate a more complex and
               dynamic network of interdependencies. Moreover, urban problems are sometimes located
               in rural areas and vice versa, but solutions to urban problems can also be found in
               rural areas as well as in urban ones. This raises the question as to whether a proper
               management of the urban-rural relationship can contribute to the sustainability transition,
               by solving problems and conflicts, increasing economic performances and improving
               the quality of life in, and around urban areas.
               In this way, from a methodological point of view, comes into play an incremental approach
               based on three specific objectives:

               Life and Attractiveness of Rural Areas
            </h2>
            <p id="d1e110">The dire ecological, economic, and social crisis of recent years has strongly called
               into question the prevailing model of development. There are two main direct consequences
               of inappropriate land management: a progressive consumption of essential natural resources
               on the one hand and the abandonment and depopulation of the most marginal areas on
               the other, which significantly impacts the safety of the territory, the environmental
               balance, and the quality of life of communities. The condition of the city, and the
               quality of life of its inhabitants, is increasingly becoming a subject of attention.
               More than 50% of the world's population now lives in urban areas, so this is where
               the real challenge of sustainability and better quality of life has to play out. At
               this time, however, the positive outcomes of these challenges still seem to be far
               from reality. The reduction of open spaces and the consequent increase of impermeable
               surfaces, air pollution, poor water quality, traffic congestion, and the increasing
               “heat island” effect, are the urban discomfort and causes of the contemporary crisis
               of the city 
               [
               <a href="#R01">1</a>
               ]
               . In this sense, many international organizations (starting with the Population Division
               of the United Nations) have sounded alarms regarding the future of cities. More than
               70% of greenhouse gas emissions in the world come from cities 
               [
               <a href="#R02">2</a>
               ]
               , which continue to grow in an uncontrolled way and become ever more unlivable, in
               addition to consuming more and more energy. The signs of this growing discomfort are
               manifest in the degradation of the urban landscape and the poor quality of life, and
               the continuous expansion of the city, that has increasingly projected toward the outside
               (Figure <a href="#Fig01">1</a>). In these cases the relationship between nature, agriculture and new urban areas,
               is developed in a continuous tension between the processes conflict, coexistence or
               (in the best cases) integration. With these dynamics, suburbs are mostly seen as an
               opportunity for growth instead of a limit. As a result of this change, the city has
               also lost its own identity and sense of place 
               [
               <a href="#R03">3</a>, <a href="#R04">4</a>, <a href="#R05">5</a>, <a href="#R06">6</a>
               ]
               , mostly due to the following phenomena: the city has expanded but consequently has
               lost the shape of a real city, in the original sense of the word; inside the city,
               individual subjectivity is opposed to collective dynamics. People tend to model their
               surrounding space according to their own measure, with individual achievements most
               of the time more replicated than planned; places for leisure and free time are losing
               space because of the contiguity and/or overlapping of different uses and functions;
               the city becomes a patchwork of everyone's space, with no flexibility of uses 
               [
               <a href="#R06">6</a>
               ]
               .
            </p>
            <p id="d1e137">This trend is a direct result of haphazard development resulting in sprawl, a phenomenon
               that disfigures the character that once gave the territory its charm. It radically
               changes rural landscapes and cherished landmarks, reduces opportunities for forms
               of outdoor and leisure activities, fragments wildlife habitats, pollutes the air,
               water, and soil, and represents an expensive land-use pattern for governments to build
               and maintain. All of these pressures generate direct impacts and put into crisis the
               sustainable and lasting use of natural resources (Figure <a href="#Fig02">2</a>).
            </p>
            <p id="d1e142">Something paradoxical happens as a result: cities grow by welcoming new people but
               reject people who aspire to a higher quality of life 
               [
               <a href="#R07">7</a>, <a href="#R08">8</a>, <a href="#R09">9</a>
               ]
               . The discomfort of the population leads to a gradual growth of consciousness and
               demand for nature. This led people to move from uncomfortable cities to more comfortable,
               open, wider spaces, rural areas, rich in natural resources and a better quality of
               life

               .
            </p>
            <p id="d1e159">Rigid, large-scale planning, which we have seen on the regional and provincial levels,
               has not been able to respond to ecological and economic changes. The weakness of planning
               practices produced to date, which have been consolidated over time, can lead back
               precisely to the tendency to presume the irreversibility of transformation processes
               and to impose stringent rules in establishing end uses.

               and social malaise. Today, reuniting humans with their environmental context in order
               to increase their quality of life cannot be delayed, and the landscape, intended as
               a “spatial configuration laden with meaning and an irreplaceable link between humans
               and natural resources”, can facilitate this reconnection 
               [
               <a href="#R12">12</a>
               ]
               . The connection between landscape and well-being was also recognized by the European
               Landscape Convention (ELC), which highlights how the landscape “undertakes important
               functions of general interest on the cultural, ecological, and social planes…[It]
               constitutes an essential aspect in the context of the life of populations…[It] is
               an essential element of individual and social well-being” 
               [
               <a href="#R13">13</a>
               ]
               . So, “Landscape is not only trees, shrubs and lawn, added for their aesthetic value.
               Rather, landscape combines landform, ecosystems and open-spaces networks that shape
               natural environment and sustain not only planting but all life forms, including humans”

               . A sustainable approach to urban planning should reverse the traditional tendency
               to think city development opposed to nature, and consider urban and natural landscape
               fully integrated and strictly connected in a unique eco-system 
               [

               . Every city has its own landscape; its unique location and the deep understanding
               of its site-specific characteristics should be the starting point for each urban design
               strategy. The benefits of pursuing a sustainable balance between nature and city are
               considerable in different ways: ecologically, socially and economically. In fact,
               nature and vegetation positively influences the local microclimate extracting CO2
               from the air, reducing dust and urban pollutants, absorbing noise, raising local humidity
               by evapotranspiration, retaining rain water and, in general, reducing heat-island
               effects. The variety of types of green areas and environments, and the diversity of
               species and combination of plants, make the local habitat more attractive for different
               birds, insects and small animals, improving the biodiversity of the city and therefore
               also increasing the accessibility to nature and different experiences to people. The
               increasing quality of the microclimate, the creation of greener spaces and likeable
               views improve people’s health and quality of life, reducing urban stress and discomfort.
               Studies in the Netherlands demonstrate that children with good access to green open
               space, fewer high rise buildings and more outdoor sports facilities, are more physically
               active. Similarly, studies of eight European cities show that people who live in areas
               with abundant green open space are three times more likely to be physically active
               and 40% cent less likely to be overweight or obese

               ]
               . School children who have access to, or even sight of, the natural environment show
               higher levels of attention than those without these benefits 
               [
               <a href="#R18">18</a>
               ]
               . Moreover, the proximity to parks, trees and quality green spaces makes living in
               the city more attractive which is reflected in property values.

                  and practitioners. It is mostly used to evaluate the general well-being of individuals
                  and societies, focused on separate dimensions of collective well-being, such as wealth
                  and employment, quality of the built environment, physical and mental health, education,

                  material living standards related mainly to individual or national aggregate levels
                  of income. In a report of the EEA, <i>Ensuring quality of life in European cities and towns</i>, quality of life is mainly defined as the availability of having public services,
                  employment, shopping, transport, green open space, culture and sport facilities as
                  well as space to live, apart from income

               <p id="d1e222">Undoubtedly, environmental and sustainability factors have great significance for
                  quality of life. Illustrating this point, Brundtland's definition of sustainability,
                  the definition of sustainable development, begins with human needs: “Sustainable development
                  meets the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future
                  generations to meet their own needs”, and the World Commission on Environment and
                  Development (WECD) further defines sustainable development as: “A global process development
                  that minimizes the use of environmental resources and reduces the impact on environmental
                  sinks using processes that simultaneously improve economy and the quality of life”.“Sustainability
                  is the continuation of the quality of life for generations to come including the proper
                  distribution of quality of life between groups and with other parts of the world”

                  . So, the very concept of sustainable development emphasizes the maintenance of natural
                  resources and the natural environment as a prerequisite for developing any economic
                  activity to achieve human well-being and quality of life. Economic activities are
                  the means to utilize these resources and to release their potential value to society
                  in order to meet human needs. A healthy environment and the wise use of natural resources
                  are indispensable for sustainable development which provides the basis for long-term

               of urban and peri-urban areas, becoming the new binder and relational matrix, between
               what is urban and what is open space. Understanding the meaning of this opportunity
               means giving way to new economies, policies for social inclusion, projects for landscape
               regeneration and plans for the rehabilitation of large settlement contexts

               <p id="d1e371">The term “green infrastructure” was first developed by Mark Benedict and Ed McMahon
                  (2002) of The Conservation Fund (TCF), in the early part of this century and is defined
                  as follows: “<i>Green infrastructure is an interconnected network of waterways, wetlands, woodlands,
                     wildlife habitats, and other natural areas; greenways, parks, and other conservation
                     lands; working farms, ranches, and forests; and wilderness and other open spaces that
                     support native species, maintain natural ecological processes, sustain air and water
                     resources, and contribute to the health and quality of life for communities and people</i>”

                  human livability while maintaining the importance of the natural system. However,
                  its focus on ecological processes misses a more inclusive framework to apply systematic
                  thinking and interconnected strategies to a broader range of elements beyond ecological
                  systems, such as cultural, social, historical, economic, and political resources,

                  : 1) identify and protect green infrastructure before development; 2) engage diverse
                  people and organizations from a range of sectors; 3) linkage is key, connecting green
                  infrastructure components with each other and with people; 4) design green infrastructure
                  systems that function at different scales and across boundaries; 5) green infrastructure
                  activity must be grounded in good science and planning practice; 6) fund green infrastructure
                  up-front as a primary public investment; 7) emphasize that green infrastructure benefits
                  are afforded to all (to nature and people); 8) green infrastructure should be the
                  framework for conservation of natural and cultural resources. Emerges that integration,
                  multi-scale approach and community involvement are the 'key-words' for the success
                  of Green Infrastructure plans and project. It is also clear that Green infrastructure
                  benefits are better achieved if green space creation and management are well integrated
                  with more traditional land development and built infrastructure planning. But does
                  a Green Infrastructure really consist of? With the European Green Infrastructure Strategy,
                  the EU clarified that not all green open spaces are possible component of a Green
                  Infrastructure, but only those of high quality and that form part of an interconnected
                  network

                  ]
                  . Examples: an urban park inside a city might be considered an integral part of Green
                  Infrastructure if it acts as a cool air corridor, absorbs excess water run-off and
                  offers an attractive outdoor area for recreation and wildlife; a patch of uniform
                  grass that contains no other environmental features is unlikely to qualify as GI.
                  In rural areas, intensively managed farmland would also not normally form part of
                  a GI network unless it were specifically managed in a way that supports local biodiversity
                  or that encourages a more multifunctional land use which combines food production
                  with other benefits, like recreation or water purification

                  ]
                  . This is the case of rural areas and urban agriculture, which is defined as growing,
                  cultivating, processing, and distributing food in or around a village, town, or city

                  ]
                  . This simple definition however, belies the complexity of the practice. Urban agriculture
                  lies between many issues which are seen as critical to the ongoing sustainability
                  and livability of our urban environments: public health, healthy food access, green
                  space, air and water quality, economic development, and community engagement

                  <a href="#R52">52</a>
                  ]
                  . Urban agriculture represents a tangible, accessible opportunity for city residents
                  to become involved in issues of food provenance and food security and to reconnect
                  with a food system that many feel is somehow out of their context. Additionally, urban
                  agriculture is consistent with, and is being bolstered by, new approaches to urban
                  design and development, which emphasize diffuse, informal, community-based initiatives,
                  open space, green space and “soft edge” interventions for the overall quality and
                  sustainability of the urban environment

                  ]
                  . At the same time, urban areas represent a relevant experimental opportunity to stimulate
                  innovative practices (such as multifunctional agriculture, urban gardening, and urban
                  agri-farming) to be exploited in relation to the need to supply public services and
                  products for the city

                  ]
                  . The role of urban agriculture practices and related activities can actually be articulated
                  on the basis of the spatial context within which they are implemented. Whether they
                  are undertaken within small/medium towns or within large cities, their role and contribution
                  to the social, economic and physical context is different, as is also the perception
                  by the local population. Within large cities and metropolitan areas, urban agriculture
                  practices are used for physical urban regeneration, land conservation, and residents
                  leisure activities (see as examples the cases of large cities, such as Milan, London,
                  or Paris with their plan for Green Infrastructures, Community Gardens, or Feeding
                  the City programmes). The situation is different for small centres. The demand for
                  ”rurality” decreases with increasing potential and actual accessibility to rural areas.
                  In such cases, their role is strictly and directly linked to the creation of opportunities
                  for tackling decline and deprivation of the local economy (see as example, The Italian
                  Strategy for Inner Areas, or the Community Economic Development strategy for US rural
                  and small town). The community and neighborhood scale, therefore, plays a fundamental
                  role in creating a sense of identity and community cohesion, which is necessary for
                  the success of initiatives of this nature

                  urban and land-use planning, energy, water, transport and economic development, social
                  justice, etc. Across the country, in at least 20 cities that have experienced industrial
                  decline, planning policies have been focused on reuse and regeneration projects for
                  food-growing activities. As a consequence, derelict land has been substituted by green
