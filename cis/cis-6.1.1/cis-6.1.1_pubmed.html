                  <p class="first" id="d1e78">To reduce the consumption of firewood for cooking and to realise recycling-driven
                     soil fertility management, three projects in Northwest Tanzania aim to provide the
                     local smallholder community with cooking and sanitation alternatives. The present
                     study proposes an integrated approach to assess the sustainability of the small-scale
                     cooking and sanitation technologies. Based on the multi-criteria decision support
                     approach (MC(D)A), we developed a decision-specific, locally adapted, and participatory
                     assessment tool: the Multi-Criteria Technology Assessment (MCTA). Pre-testing of the
                     tailored tool was set up with representatives of Tanzanian and German partners of
                     case study projects. From a methodological perspective, we conclude that the MCTA
                     uses a set of relevant criteria to realise a transparent and replicable computational
                     Excel-tool. The combination of MC(D)A for structuring the assessment with analytical
                     methods, such as Material Flow Analysis, for describing the performance of alternatives
                     is a promising path for designing integrated approaches to sustainability assessments
                     of technologies. Pre-testing of the tool served as a proof-of-concept for the general
                     design of the method. Future applications and adjustments of the MCTA require the
                     inclusion of end-users, a reasonable and participatory reduction of criteria, and
                     an increase of feedback loops and group discussions between participants and the facilitator
                     to support a common learning about the technologies and thorough understanding of
                     the perspectives of participants.

               <p id="d1e109">There is broad consensus that—from a global perspective—the excessive use of natural
                  resources by human beings (in particular the resource consumption of the richer countries)
                  has manifold consequences [<a href="#R01">1</a>, <a href="#R02">2</a>]. The anthropogenic overexploitation of natural resources results, for example, in
                  (i) shortages of resources, such as oil, coal, sand, or rock phosphate [<a href="#R03">3</a>], (ii) climate change [<a href="#R04">4</a>], or (iii) decrease of soil fertility [<a href="#R05">5</a>]. By various means, we are crossing the <i>planetary boundaries</i> [<a href="#R06">6</a>]. With respect to biogeochemical flows and genetic diversity, the planetary boundaries
                  are stressed to such an extent that we risk non-reversible changes of the environment
                  and even the habitability of the earth. Agriculture, in particular—respectively the
                  production and use of synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, or seeds—contributes to this
                  risk [<a href="#R07">7</a>]. How, therefore, can we change the situation? Or, more specifically: How can we
                  meet the (human) demand for food and energy without overexploiting our planet?
               </p>
               <p id="d1e136">Recognized recommendations for a <i>sustainable</i> use of resources include, for example [<a href="#R02">2</a>, <a href="#R08">8</a>, <a href="#R09">9</a>, <a href="#R10">10</a>]: (i) establishing circular economies; (ii) using effective, efficient, adapted,
                  and affordable technologies; and (iii) utilizing locally available resources for soil
                  fertility management. Measures to establish circular economies comprise <i>inter alia</i> (i) the concept of <i>bioenergy</i>, hence the provision and use of energy from biomass [<a href="#R11">11</a>], respectively renewable resources or organic waste materials, and (ii) the implementation
                  of <i>ecological sanitation</i> (EcoSan). With the latter, various material flows are collected separately, treated
                  specifically, and, if possible, ultimately recycled to agricultural land [<a href="#R12">12</a>]. Both topics, bioenergy and EcoSan, are well-studied and have already been brought
                  into practical applications.

               <p id="d1e172">Against this backdrop, and given that over 50% of global food products are produced
                  by small-scale farmers [<a href="#R13">13</a>], the sustainability potentials of smallholder communities in the Global South is
                  of major relevance. In the Northwest of Tanzania (TZ), a representative region for
                  Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), the main energy carrier is firewood, mostly used for cooking
                  on a three-stone fire, whilst pit latrines are the most common sanitation approach
                  [<a href="#R14">14</a>]. This pattern, alongside a steady population growth, increasingly stresses natural
                  resources such as arable land, aquifers or other water sources, and forests [<a href="#R15">15</a>, <a href="#R16">16</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e186">To counteract local deforestation and soil nutrient depletion, two Tanzanian farmers
                  initiatives have started three projects located in Karagwe, Kagera region, together
                  with German partners and donors [<a href="#R17">17</a>]. The main objective of the technological development cooperation was to contribute
                  to <i>sustainable community development</i> by adapting and introducing small-scale and locally <i>adequate</i> cooking and sanitation technologies [<a href="#R18">18</a>]. At the same time, a circular resource economy shall be implemented to improve local
                  soils and food production. Therefore, residues from cooking and sanitation are used
                  to increase the recycling of nutrients and the recovery of carbon for restoring soil
                  humus.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e200">Previous work covers how these locally adapted technologies in smallholder households
                  contribute to environmental health by reducing deforestation, climate gas emissions,
                  and nutrient leaching to aquifers [<a href="#R19">19</a>]. We further showed that using residues from cooking and sanitation could stimulate
                  the productivity of smallholder farming by improving the acidic and nutrient-depleted
                  local soil [<a href="#R20">20</a>, <a href="#R21">21</a>]. Subsequently, we widened our perspective to evaluate the technologies studied according
                  to multiple <i>sustainability</i> dimensions.

               <p id="d1e217">The challenge of any <i>sustainability assessment</i> [<a href="#R22">22</a>] is to translate defined and basically agreed upon principles into an operational
                  model [<a href="#R23">23</a>]. However, even though measurable criteria can be applied to operationalize sustainability,
                  it is individuals or societies who evaluate the plausibility and credibility of relevant
                  assessments. If the process involves multiple actors, differing opinions may also
                  cause trade-offs between stakeholders. Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) attempts
                  to address this challenge [<a href="#R24">24</a>, <a href="#R25">25</a>, <a href="#R26">26</a>]. In the first instance, any assessment of alternatives against multiple criteria,
                  irrespective of who participates in the analysis, can generally be called a Multi-Criteria
                  Analysis (MCA) [<a href="#R27">27</a>, <a href="#R28">28</a>]. Moreover, MCDA indicates a specific MCA, addressing <i>participatory</i> decision-making processes [<a href="#R29">29</a>]. Both approaches, MCA and MCDA, are applied in planning, decision, and evaluation
                  processes and to assess likely consequences of decisions [<a href="#R30">30</a>]. In the following, we use the abbreviation MC(D)A when referring to characteristics
                  of both approaches.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e253">According to [<a href="#R31">31</a>], the MC(D)A is generally suitable for decisions related to sustainable development
                  because the method is largely transparent, participatory, and inter-disciplinary.
                  Furthermore, the MC(D)A is often applied in environmental decision making [<a href="#R32">32</a>, <a href="#R33">33</a>] and strategic planning for natural resources management [<a href="#R34">34</a>]. While the number of MC(D)A applications has clearly grown over the last two decades,
                  the method was mainly applied in scientific communities in the Global North [<a href="#R35">35</a>]. Among the view examples of MC(D)A-studies from SSA are (i) comparisons of different
                  sanitation approaches in Uganda [<a href="#R36">36</a>] and in Burkina Faso [35], (ii) an assessment of cook stoves in TZ [<a href="#R37">37</a>], and (iii) an evaluation of appropriate farming techniques in TZ [<a href="#R38">38</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e280">With this study, we want to contribute to advancing the applicability of MC(D)A in
                  the regional context of SSA as well as in the topical context of technology-driven
                  sustainable community development in the Global South and Global North alike.

                  tool, and (iii) to test the tool with selected stakeholders (<i>pre-testing</i>). Our specific focus addresses small-scale cooking and sanitation technologies alongside
                  the use of residues in smallholder farming, and on the example of Tanzanian case studies.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e290">The specific research objectives are: (i) to identify a set of criteria and applicable

               <p id="d1e295">The research questions are as follows: (RQ1) What are the most relevant criteria and

                  technologies? (RQ2) How did the stakeholders involved in pre-testing rated the technologies
                  at hand with regard to relevant criteria and to overall sustainability? (RQ3) How

                  is located about 1,500 km away from the Tanzanian capital Dar Es Salaam. The regional
                  economy is dominated by smallholder agriculture with about 90% of households trading
                  agricultural products grown on their farms [<a href="#R14">14</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e328">Three Karagwe projects serve as our case studies: (i) <i>Biogas Support for Tanzania</i> (BiogaST), which aims to implement small-scale biogas digesters to use bioenergy
                  from harvest and kitchen residues for cooking; (ii) <i>Efficient Cooking in Tanzania</i> (EfCoiTa), which disseminates advanced designs of improved cook stoves (ICS), such
                  as microgasifier cook stoves; and (iii) <i>Carbonization and Sanitation</i> (CaSa), which works with EcoSan, including a urine-diverting dry toilet (UDDT), thermal
                  sanitation of faeces, and composting of human excreta mixed with other organic wastes
                  including <i>biochar</i>. The latter material is a residue from cooking with microgasifiers. Cooking and sanitation
                  are connected through the use of residues for soil fertility management, which makes
                  the energy-sanitation-agriculture nexus even more interesting to study. In prior publications,
                  we introduced the case studies [<a href="#R17">17</a>] and described the technologies [<a href="#R19">19</a>]. All technologies shall be implemented and used in both, households and institutions
                  (e.g. in schools or hospitals). The local non-governmental organisation (NGO) <i>Mavuno Project - Improvement for Community Relief and Services</i> (MAVUNO) facilitates the BiogaST- and CaSa-projects. The <i>Programme for Community Habitat Environmental Management</i> (CHEMA) runs the EfCoiTa-project. German project partners are Engineers Without Borders
                  (EWB) Berlin/Germany and <i>Technische Universität</i> (TU) Berlin. Financing of the projects is provided by German foundations <i>BayWa</i> (BiogaST) and <i>Heidehof</i> (CaSa and EfCoiTa). After completing pilot studies, a strategy and a plan for implementing
                  technologies in the smallholder community needs to be developed. Hence, the respective
                  technologies are the subject of decisions at hand. Decision makers are either the
                  NGOs, implementing the technologies on a project-basis, or single households, purchasing
                  them, for example, from local manufacturers or at local markets.

               <p id="d1e367">The method shall: (i) enable a systematic analysis; (ii) consider multiple perspectives
                  related to sustainability; (iii) involve local communities and authorities in the
                  assessment; (iv) integrate available data; and (iv) be conducted ahead of the technologies
                  implementation in the community. Against this backdrop, we chose to follow the systematic
                  concept of MC(D)A.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e369">According to [<a href="#R34">34</a>], MC(D)A consists of three pillars, which are: (i) the presence of multiple criteria;
                  (ii) the formal approach with a set of analytical methods; and (iii) the involvement
                  of individuals or groups of individuals in the assessment (for MCA) or in the decision
                  process (for MCDA). The MC(D)A further combines a range of methodologies to use quantitative
                  and qualitative data for (i) measuring sets of criteria, (ii) considering consequences
                  of decisions, and for (iii) sequencing alternatives [<a href="#R29">29</a>]. Applied MC(D)As often combine (i) qualitative methods for problem structuring,
                  (ii) quantitative methods for problem analysis, and (iii) soft methods for stakeholder
                  participation [<a href="#R34">34</a>]. Aggregation of an assessment is possible from the level of different criteria into
                  an overall performance of alternatives and, likewise, from the level of individual
                  preferences into a common, average preference [<a href="#R29">29</a>] (For the interested reader, a summary of the fundamental terms used in MC(D)A can
                  be found in Table A.1). Based on a comprehensive literature review, especially [<a href="#R23">23</a>, <a href="#R33">33</a>, <a href="#R39">39</a>, <a href="#R40">40</a>, <a href="#R41">41</a>, <a href="#R42">42</a>, <a href="#R43">43</a>] inspired the design of our MC(D)A approach. The dynamic process of developing the
                  specific design of our method and tool will be described in the following paragraphs
                  (with more details provided in Appendix Section A.2).

               <p id="d1e405">
                  <span style="text-decoration: underline">(A) Framing the context:</span> Formulating the <i>decision problem</i> involved learning about the context of the decision, such as livelihood of the community,
                  specific approaches of the case studies, and ways of using technologies in daily life.
                  The main activities, therefore, included: participating in projects; short- and long-term
                  stays in Karagwe; teamwork with project workers; reading project reports, governmental
                  reports, and non-governmental reports; and communicating with scientists and practitioners
                  in the region. Based on this, we described the environment of the decision including
                  <i>driving forces</i> (Table <a href="#Tab01">1</a>) and <i>motivations</i> (Table <a href="#Tab02">2</a>) that represent the objectives of the projects initiators to develop and implement
                  ‘new’ technologies in the Karagwe smallholder community.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e426">In addition, two <i>Process Flow Diagrams</i> (PFD) foster a better understanding of the technologies and possible nutrient recycling
                  approaches when interacting with people. Both PFDs indicate how the technologies analysed
                  are integrated in on-farm resource management and how they interact with the natural
                  environment in terms of resource consumption and emissions. One PFD is a more systematic
                  illustration (Figure <a href="#Fig1">1</a>); the other PFD is a more pictorial illustration (Figure A.1).

                  <span style="text-decoration: underline">(B) Creating alternatives:</span> 
                  <i>Alternatives</i> to be analysed are either (i) discrete technologies or (ii) a mix of technologies
                  [<a href="#R39">39</a>]. In the present study, we decided to analyse discrete technologies that are defined
                  by the case studies (Table <a href="#Tab03">3</a>; cf. Tables A.3–A.5 for pictures and descriptions). Currently, the most common combination
                  of technologies for cooking and sanitation found in Karagwe smallholdings is a three-stone
                  fire and pit latrine [<a href="#R14">14</a>]. The alternatives assessed are further technologies that are locally available (i.e.
                  technically and commercially) for implementation. We compared (i) technologies represented
                  in the case study projects, and (ii) other widespread alternatives. Regarding the
                  first point, cooking alternatives include: a system composed of a biogas digester
                  and a biogas burner, developed and adapted to Karagwe conditions by the BiogaST-project;
                  and two types of ICSs promoted by the EfCoiTa-project, such as the rocket stove and
                  the microgasifier. MAVUNO endorses implementation of biogas systems at households
                  through development cooperation projects whilst CHEMA produces and disseminates rocket
                  stoves and microgasifiers at their workshop. Sanitation alternatives include to ecological
                  approaches, namely, “EcoSan” that refers to using an UDDT and “CaSa” that refers to
                  using the UDDT in combination with a sanitation oven for thermal treatment of excreta
                  pursuant to the practices of the CaSa-project. MAVUNO is engaged in testing and promoting
                  both approaches. Regarding the second point, charcoal stoves (also called “charcoal
                  burners”) are commonly available in Karagwe on markets and from local stove sellers
                  and a combination of a flush toilet and septic tank can be accessed through local
                  plumbers. The charcoal and biogas alternative also include the charcoal production
                  and biogas digester. These processes provide the energy carrier used in households.
                  Rocket or microgasifier stoves, in comparison, make direct use of firewood or sawdust.
                  The latter is an available waste resource in many anthropogenic settings.

                  criteria need to be identified to describe the multiple dimensions. According to MC(D)A
                  methodology, <i>main-criteria</i> describe the <i>objectives</i>, or highest-level criteria, and <i>sub-criteria</i> describe the <i>attributes</i>, or lowest-level criteria [<a href="#R29">29</a>, <a href="#R32">32</a>]. To identify such criteria, we performed a comprehensive literature review. Our
                  focus was specifically on comparable work conducted (i) for topics such as bioenergy,
                  EcoSan, and soil fertility or natural resource management, and (ii) in a regional
                  context of TZ, East-Africa, or SSA. We further collaborated with practitioners, academic
                  professionals, and other experts in bioenergy and/or sanitation in an East-African-context.
                  Activities and methods applied include: (i) semi-structured interviews conducted in
                  TZ and Uganda; (ii) group discussions based on the <i>world café method</i> [<a href="#R45">45</a>] in TZ and Germany; and (iii) discussion with the coordinator of BiogaST and CaSa
                  projects (A. Bitakwate) to conclude a final set of criteria.

                  assessment process. Stakeholder representatives participate, in particular, in conducting

                  agencies; (ii) governmental authorities; (iii) specialists (e.g. stove technicians,
                  EcoSan-experts, or strategic advisors); (iv) (future) staff for operation and maintenance;
                  (v) end-users of the technologies and/or of the by-products; (vi) legislator and enforcement
                  agencies; (vii) research institutions; (viii) local, national and international NGOs;
                  and (ix) site residents (if any). In our case, local smallholders are probably the
                  stakeholders being most affected by the technologies assessed.

               <p id="d1e748">As a consequence, we developed a hand-made and Excel-based assessment tool. The tool
                  is tailored to our specific application and based on a template of [<a href="#R23">23</a>]. In total, the designed tool comprises sheets for (i) providing information to participants,

                  calculating, summarizing, and visualizing results. The latter include so-called <i>Performance Matrices</i> (PM) that summarize weights, scores, and results for each participant and all alternatives.
                  To elicit individual preferences from participants, we selected applicable methods
                  for participatory weighting and scoring from [<a href="#R29">29</a>, <a href="#R32">32</a>, <a href="#R39">39</a>]. The weighting further comprises <i>ranking</i> and <i>rating</i> of main- and sub-criteria. Ranking is the ordering of criteria according to individually

                  ranging from 0 to 100 to each criterion in order to differentiate between the criteria.

                  participating in pre-testing the MC(D)A tool include: (i) the facilitating NGOs, represented

                  technologies, we propose a tool called the Multi-Criteria Technology Assessment (MCTA).
                  We designed the MCTA by adapting MC(D)A and developing a tool, which is adequate for
                  the sustainability assessment of small-scale cooking and sanitation technologies.
                  The process included activities as described in Section 2.2. Results with respect
                  to the identification of most relevant criteria and applicable methods for assessing
                  the sustainability of small-scale cooking and sanitation technologies (RQ1) are presented

                  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Selection of criteria:</span> [-10]To define the main-criteria considered in the MCTA, we merged sustainability
                  categories of [<a href="#R47">47</a>] with aspects from the Integrated Sustainable Waste Management approach of [<a href="#R48">48</a>] that describes “the enabling environment of sustainability”. Finally, we chose the
                  following main-criteria as being most relevant: technological-operational, environmental,
                  health/hygiene, socio-cultural, socio-economic/financial, and political/legal criteria.
                  Pursuant to [<a href="#R23">23</a>], we use a six-pointed so-called “sustainability star” (Figure <a href="#Fig2">2</a>) to visualise how we define sustainability in the MCTA. Each of the six dimensions
                  represents one of the six main-criteria and thus reflects an objective of sustainability
                  that is addressed in the analysis of cooking and sanitation technologies. Furthermore,
                  the categories “acceptability”, “affordability”, and “reliability” are assigned to
                  the main-criteria. Derived from Sustainable Development Goal no. 7 of the United Nations,
                  these indicate characteristics, which feature a sustainable use of energy technologies

               <p id="d1e885">The final selection of sub-criteria (Table A.8) constitutes a synthesis of criteria
                  from [<a href="#R23">23</a>, <a href="#R36">36</a>, <a href="#R37">37</a>, <a href="#R50">50</a>] (cf. Table A.6). From a total of 84 sub-criteria considered in the MCTA, 80 and
                  75 are applied for assessing cooking and sanitation technologies, respectively (Table
                  A.7).
               </p>
               <p id="d1e899">Overall, we consider the chosen criteria as significant to systematically identify
                  strengths and weaknesses of technologies and to assess their sustainability. However,
                  criteria are not thoroughly independent from each other. Some criteria describe different
                  objectives even though they are related to each other. For example, two of the technological-operational
                  criteria are “preferably high use of locally available resources” and “preferably
                  low use of industrial resources”. Both sub-criteria are related to the socio-economic/financial
                  criterion “preferably low cost for implementation” because the material use influences
                  production costs. Another reason for preferring a substantial use of locally available
                  resources is, however, a higher degree of independence from international markets
                  (and main providers of industrial materials). To sum up, most of the sub-criteria
                  applied are intermediate or so-called “means-to-an-end” objectives rather than fundamental
                  objectives [<a href="#R39">39</a>]. Nevertheless, according to [<a href="#R32">32</a>] this approach is not contradicting the MC(D)A concept.

                  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Collection of data:</span> Overall, our study integrates quantitative data of recent scientific findings and
                  explorative practitioners’ experiences with qualitative data collected from literature,
                  oral explanations by farmers, learning from participating in the projects, and expert
                  judgements. Quantitative data of prior studies, where we employed Material Flow Analysis
                  (MFA) [<a href="#R19">19</a>] also in combination with Soil Nutrient Balancing (SNB) [<a href="#R21">21</a>], was particularly important to describe environmental attributes. The MFA identifies
                  and quantifies sources, sinks, directions, magnitudes, connections, dependencies,
                  and shifts of material flows between the anthroposphere and the environment [<a href="#R51">51</a>]. The SNB specifically measures, calculates, and balances various input and output
                  flows of nutrients to and from agricultural land [<a href="#R52">52</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e924">Against the backdrop that reaching environmental sustainability requires a systematic
                  reduction of the physical degradation of nature [<a href="#R53">53</a>], we consider MFA and SNB as highly suitable methods to be integrated in a multi-criteria
                  sustainability assessment. By combining qualitative and quantitative methods for data
                  collection, the MCTA realises an <i>integrated approach</i> as recommended by [<a href="#R24">24</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e935">Data collection, however, was challenging. Available and accessible data in the given
                  context was not sufficient to estimate and to describe performances of most technologies.
                  In order to generate a profound basis for the MCTA, we needed significant additional
                  efforts and approximately two years for conducting performance tests of the technologies,
                  elaborating a field trial and MFA and SNB modelling. Hence, describing the performance
                  of the alternatives was challenging and time-consuming, which resulted in certain
                  shortcomings of the pre-test.

                  is done by applying the SWING-method [<a href="#R29">29</a>]; sub-criteria are then simply rated. From the <i>numeric weights</i> (i.e. points ranging from 0 to 100) given by participants during rating, the tool
                  supports the planner in determining the <i>relative weights</i> of sub- and main-criteria (Equations A.1–A.5). Subsequently, scoring is conducted
                  for each sub-criterion and each alternative separately. Participants therefore assign
                  <i>numeric scores</i> in points ranging from <span class="inline-formula">

                  the associated value. In the MCTA, participants also have the option to waive scoring,
                  by indicating a * instead of assigning points, if they consider available information
                  as insufficient and/or feel unsure about scoring. In offering this *-option, we attempt
                  to not force participants into an arbitrary judgement.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e974">Pursuant to the SAW, the assigned scores are firstly weighted on the lowest level
                  of single attributes. The tool, therefore, determines the <i>weighted score</i> for each sub-criterion as the product of (calculated) relative weight and (assigned)
                  score (Equation A.6). Computations are adapted for the *-case as described in the
                  Appendix (Equations A.4 and A.6). Subsequently, plain addition determines the weighted
                  scores for each main-criterion (Equation A.7). To deduce the <i>overall value</i> of an alternative, weighted scores are then further aggregated to result in a final
                  <i>Sustainability Index</i> (SI). The SI is determined for each person (Equation A.8) along with an <i>average SI</i> of all participants for each alternative (Equation A.9).

                  visualizations, which are inspired by [<a href="#R23">23</a>]: (i) a colour-coded scatter plot showing the relative weights assigned to main-criteria;
                  (ii) bar diagrams ranking the alternatives with respect to the average SI; (iii) colour-coded
                  scatter plots showing the average SI for all alternatives in one graph; (iv) colour-coded
                  scatter plots showing assessment results on the level of main-criteria; (v) colour-coded
                  bar diagrams showing the distribution of the SI as the balance of positive and negative
                  weighted scores on the level of main-criteria; and (vi) a summary of scoring and weighting
                  results on the level of main-criteria. The latter three types of visualizations summarize
                  the voting of all participants in one graph for each alternative. The colour-coded
                  scatter plots indicate assessment results of different stakeholder groups alongside

               <p id="d1e1105">We acknowledge that the computational approach of the MCTA is rather simple, however,
                  in accordance with basic principles of MC(D)A modelling [<a href="#R29">29</a>]. For example, on the one hand, the final single index makes alternatives directly
                  commensurable [<i>ibid</i>.]. On the other hand, the applied methods, MAVT and SAW, belong to compensatory MC(D)A
                  techniques [<i>ibid</i>.]. This means that a very bad scoring for one attribute can be compensated by a very
                  good scoring for another and <i>vice versa</i>. Furthermore, instead of determining specific value functions for each participant,
                  we assumed linearity. The main reason was to avoid overstraining participants. Furthermore,
                  the statistical approach is rather simple but viable. As featured by [<a href="#R34">34</a>], who demand a “more transparent, simple, and easily accessible participatory modelling
                  paradigm and process”, we thus consider the MCTA as a valid methodological extension
                  of the MC(D)A. Finally, visualisations support communication of results to and between
                  participants. Graphs are designed so that they can effectively help (i) to reveal
                  issues that need to be addressed before considering a technology suitable for sustainable
                  community development, (ii) to identify the specific fields where further improvements
                  of the technology are needed, and, finally, (iii) to avoid potential project ruptures
                  in the future.

               <p id="d1e1210">Comparing weights assigned by participants, there is a tendency that Tanzanians consider
                  health/hygiene and environmental criteria more important in comparison to Germans.
                  German representatives, in contrast, perceive technological-operational and socio-cultural
                  criteria as more important compared to Tanzanians.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1212">We explain the finding that stakeholders consider the environment to be the most important
                  dimension of sustainability because the environmental main-criterion include many
                  sub-criteria related to agriculture, and is consequently perceived as highly important
                  for smallholders. On the contrary, according to [<a href="#R55">55</a>], residents in the vicinity of Arusha/TZ do not consider environment as an important
                  objective when choosing renewable energy technologies for electrification. Only one
                  interviewee out of about 40 respondents, who were mainly farmers, addressed an environmental
                  criterion as an influencing factor to purchase a solar home system [<i>ibid.</i>]. Respondents instead mentioned health and hygiene as the most important objectives
                  for their families [<i>ibid.</i>].
                  
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1223">Additionally, [<a href="#R56">56</a>] state that environmental criteria are less relevant for residents when assessing
                  sanitation systems in a peri-urban area in Burkina Faso. In order to perceive a certain
                  sanitation system as appropriate, factors such as costs and service quality are most
                  relevant for participants [<i>ibid.</i>]. Nevertheless, we understand our finding that environmental criteria are most relevant,
                  by the fact that (i) our study area is a rural area farther away from urban settlements
                  compared to the study areas of [<a href="#R55">55</a>] or [<a href="#R56">56</a>] and (ii) that many participants in our study are closely related to environmental
                  settings (e.g. farmers with off-farm income, agricultural technicians, environmental
                  scientists, and environmental activists).
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1237">In other comparative studies of small-scale bioenergy technologies from SSA, however,
                  highest weights are assigned to the technological-operational criterion. For example,
                  in an assessment of ICSs available on the Tanzanian market, criteria related to the
                  construction or operation of stoves ranked highest, such as manufacturability, durability,
                  or portability [<a href="#R37">37</a>]. Furthermore, stakeholders participating in an assessment of a biogas system in
                  Bahir Dar, a city in northwest Ethiopia, consider technological-operational criteria
                  as most important dimension of sustainability [<a href="#R23">23</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1245">In our study, lowest priority is assigned to the political/legal main-criterion. We
                  reason that there is little governmental support in TZ and especially in the study
                  region, which is recognized by stakeholders, and thus influences their judgements.
                  National programs for promoting renewable energies and supporting access to such technologies
                  especially in rural areas of TZ include the Rural Energy Fund, the Rural Energy Agency,
                  and the Tanzanian Domestic Biogas Program (TDBP) [<a href="#R37">37</a>, <a href="#R57">57</a>]. However, to our knowledge, these programs have not yet reached Karagwe. For example,
                  TBDP has not yet chosen or appointed implementation partners in the region. According
                  to [<a href="#R37">37</a>], Tanzanian standards for cooking technologies are only available for charcoal stoves
                  whilst existing standards are not enforced. Furthermore, governmental initiatives,
                  intended to support bioenergy implementation, are not coordinated and, thus, largely
                  inefficient [<i>ibid.</i>]. With respect to sanitation, [<a href="#R58">58</a>] also criticizes a strong lack of legislation in the sector of non-sewer sanitation
                  service in TZ.

               <p id="d1e1262">The finding that only average importance is given to socio-cultural aspects is comparable
                  to studies of [<a href="#R23">23</a>] and [<a href="#R37">37</a>] and in the study of [<a href="#R56">56</a>] only minor importance is assigned to socio-cultural criteria.

               <p id="d1e1331">When crosschecking the assessment results with literature, we consider our findings
                  for cooking alternatives as highly comparable to [<a href="#R37">37</a>]. In both studies, microgasifiers and rocket stoves receive positive scores because
                  of their potential to reduce fuel consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1336">Interestingly, Tanzanian participants in particular assigned positive scores to the
                  biogas system and for sub-criteria on GHG-emissions despite the fact that the description
                  clearly stated that GHG-emissions would <i>increase</i> compared to cooking on a three-stone fire. We reason that Tanzanian stakeholders
                  are aware of the minor influence of TZ on global GHG-emissions, compared to Germany,
                  other European countries, or the United States. We further argue that there is a strong
                  and positive pre-conception of the biogas system as an “environmental-friendly technology”.
                  Regarding the usability of cooking technologies, all stakeholders participating in
                  the MCTA agreed that the biogas system performs the worst of all alternatives analysed.
                  Major problems identified are thereby (i) water requirements for a sound operation
                  of the digester and (ii) lack of robustness of the system towards changes in climate
                  conditions and user abuse. Also with respect to costs (including costs for implementation,
                  operation, and maintenance), the biogas technology is assessed as the most disadvantageous
                  cooking alternative. To underline scorings of costs, investment costs of locally available
                  alternatives in Karagwe are as follows: costs for implementing a biogas system are
                  approximately €1,200 , which makes possessing a biogas digester a substantial investment
                  for smallholders. In comparison, acquisition costs of charcoal stoves or ICSs range
                  from 2 to about €25 (cf. Table A.5). Furthermore, [<a href="#R57">57</a>] identify high installation and maintenance costs as key barriers for biogas implementation
                  in TZ, despite the fact that households are willing to adopt the technology. Hence,
                  [<a href="#R57">57</a>] conclude that implementing biogas in rural areas requires financial support by national
                  programs through subsidies and/or loans.

                  rocket stoves, and microgasifiers negatively and below the average SI (Figure S.3).
                  German participants, however, assess these technologies with positive and above-average
                  valuations. A reverse tendency, however, is depicted for the biogas systems: judgements
                  of German participants are rather negative and below the average SI, whilst Tanzanians
                  assess the technology positively and above the average SI. Most prominently, staff
                  members of CHEMA ascribe the highest positive points to rocket and microgasifier stoves,
                  which are the cooking technologies that CHEMA disseminates. Likewise, staff members
                  of MAVUNO rate ICSs with rather negative scores compared to the biogas system, which
                  is the technology MAVUNO promotes in Karagwe.

                  to the septic alternative. There is, however, no significant difference in the assessment
                  of EcoSan and CaSa because respective error bars in Figure <a href="#Fig6">6</a> overlap [<a href="#R54">54</a>]. Overall, the performance of EcoSan and CaSa approaches is assessed as “good or
                  ordinary”, which means that the choice group of participants values both approaches
                  as “acceptable” to “slightly favourable” alternatives. On the contrary, participants
                  assess the septic alternative as “slightly unfavourable” alternative.

               <p id="d1e1419">Regarding the six sustainability dimensions, EcoSan and CaSa receive positive assessment
                  results mainly for technological-operational, environmental, and socio-economic/financial
                  functions (Figure <a href="#Fig7">7</a>). Negative assessment results refer, in particular, to the political/legal criterion.
                  Shortcomings of the septic alternative mainly refer to the environmental, health/hygiene,
                  and socio-economic/financial criteria.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1424">Crosschecking our results with literature, the observation that a clearly better socio-economic/financial
                  performance is assigned to the ecological approaches compared to the septic alternatives,
                  is in line with [<a href="#R56">56</a>]. For the case of Burkina Faso, [<a href="#R56">56</a>] report that in particular low- and middle-income households perceive the UDDT as
                  more financially appropriate compared to septic tanks. Strategic thinking, which includes
                  considering operational costs as an important factor, influences households’ judgements
                  [<a href="#R56">56</a>]. In contrast, high-income households consider the septic system as more appropriate
                  compared to the UDDT, because for this social group factors such as service quality
                  are more important than costs [<i>ibid.</i>]. Farmers in Karagwe belong, however, mainly to low- and middle-income household
                  groups [<a href="#R14">14</a>]. (Table A.5 summarizes costs of sanitation alternatives.)
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1441">The pre-test further indicated certain doubts about the approaches, in particular
                  on the sub-criteria “safe working conditions” and “safety in operation through avoiding
                  risks of infection to users”. In contrast, literature commonly promotes EcoSan as
                  a <i>safe</i> sanitation alternative because of the multi-barrier approach applied [<a href="#R12">12</a>, <a href="#R59">59</a>]. To our knowledge, there were, however, no instances of sickness during the course
                  of the CaSa pilot project that ran more than four years. Further investigations might
                  follow-up this significant observation (cf. Section 4.2.). In total, the performance
                  of ecological alternatives against the health/hygiene main-criterion is neutral. [-10]Our
                  finding ultimately supports integrating health/hygiene as criterion when assessing
                  sanitation technologies. This helps to identify areas of conflict, as shown in our
                  case. Health/hygiene criteria should, therefore, not be excluded from analyses as
                  it was, for example, the case in studies by [<a href="#R56">56</a>] or [<a href="#R60">60</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1458">Furthermore, we find that socio-cultural performances assessed for EcoSan and CaSa
                  alternatives are comparable to assessment results for the septic system. We attribute
                  this finding to the practical demonstration of UDDT-technology in the region. On the
                  contrary, [<a href="#R56">56</a>] identify UDDT as less socio-culturally accepted compared to a septic system and,
                  therefore, request more alternatives and their advantages and disadvantages before
                  assessing the technologies. This was exactly the case in the CaSa pilot project’s
                  course.

                  alternatives (Figure S.4) reveals as well high variations in assessment results. The

                  For both ecological alternatives, Tanzanian stakeholders assess negatively and below
                  the average SI, whilst German participants rate the alternatives clearly positive
                  and above the average SI. In contrast, most German participants assess the septic
                  alternative as clearly more negative and below the average SI compared to their Tanzanian
                  fellows. Only for the septic system, the assessments of all participants are rather
                  homogenous and less differentiated compared to other sanitation technologies. In addition,
                  the septic alternative receives an average negative SI from all except one participant.
                  Most prominent is, however, that one German participant, who has been strongly involved
                  in designing, developing, and testing the CaSa-approach, assigns the highest positive
                  scores to that sanitation alternative.

               <p id="d1e1544">We further learned that the visualisations of results, as integrated part of the MCTA-tool,
                  are highly supportive to shed light on individual perspectives and valuations of stakeholders
                  for the assessed alternatives. The visualisations help to make subjectivity in scoring
                  results transparent. Here, we agree with [<a href="#R40">40</a>] who emphasises that showing stakeholders each other’s preferences is rather one
                  of the most relevant results of conducting an MC(D)A. The visualisations further allow
                  for a target-oriented improvement to overcome shortcomings of the technologies. [15]Due
                  to the low sample size and the high variance we observed in the tool’s pre-test, some
                  visualization are not discussed thoroughly in this article. They are, however, presented
                  in the Supplements (cf. Figures S.5–S.8).
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1549">As other benefits of the MCTA, we concluded that the assessment process promotes collaborative
                  learning and a better understanding of the technologies assessed. Final feedback revealed
                  that five out of six participants articulated that the MCTA supported them in forming
                  their own opinion about the technologies (Figure S.9). Hence, our method reacts on
                  [<a href="#R61">61</a>] who promote “embedded learning”, that is integrating recent findings and sustainability
                  assessment. This integration also constitutes an important part of the analytical
                  tool we developed. Information that is provided to participants during the assessment
                  process and describe various impacts of the technologies assessed, originate <i>inter alia</i> from recent action research conducted in Karagwe.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1558">Despite these benefits, we further experienced the challenge of “balancing three tensions:
                  (i) maintaining scientific credibility, (ii) assuring practical saliency, and (iii)
                  legitimising the process to multiple participants” [<a href="#R62">62</a>]. In particular, we identify certain limitations referring to (I) the choice of alternatives
                  and participants, (II) the realised means of participation, (III) time consumption,
                  communication effort and complexity, and (IV) gender balance.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1563">(I) Firstly, we acknowledge that technologies mostly applied for the time being, which
                  are three-stone fire and pit latrine, are not among the alternatives assessed. One
                  could further criticise the fact that farmers were not involved in the assessment
                  even though they represent the party most concerned and that the technologies assessed
                  were developed to improve livelihoods of smallholders. [10]Reasons for conducting
                  a pre-test of the MCTA-tool with local representatives limited to NGOs’ staff members
                  are disclosed in Section 2.3. Our proceeding is supported by [<a href="#R63">63</a>] who also recommend establishing intermediaries between research institutions and
                  farmers when evaluating agricultural projects. Culture and social standing of research
                  and/or NGOs can inhibit reciprocal communication between researchers and farmers.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1568">(II) We acknowledge that the MCTA process is not participatory throughout as intended.
                  This is a consequence of additional empirical data generated and that we faced a conflict
                  between the scope of the work and the available time budget when actually starting
                  the pre-test. Hence, we had to adapt the 9-steps-approach. Initially we wanted to
                  include more feedback loops during the process, for example, in order to discuss experiences
                  after scoring, and, thereafter, offering participants the opportunity to adapt their
                  valuations. Moreover, the assessment was conducted separately, meaning that Tanzanian
                  participants were in TZ and German participants in Germany. This fact results, in
                  limited insights into the individual perceptions and, thus, inhibits <i>joint</i> understanding and learning of participants.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1573">(III) We understand that high time consumption is often reported as a problem when
                  conducting a participatory MC(D)A [<a href="#R38">38</a>, <a href="#R40">40</a>]. Nonetheless, in the final feedback, most participants judged the scope of the MCTA,
                  defined by time budget, details, number of criteria, clarity of the task, amount of
                  information, etc., as good and to cope with (Figure S.9). Moreover, extensive communication
                  (via e-mail and Skype) between the planner and individual participants was required
                  to identify and solve possible misunderstandings. For example, participants scored
                  alternatives significantly different although the performance of these alternatives
                  was described as strongly comparable. Differing backgrounds of participants might
                  explain this, as well as the problems they faced in understanding all (scientific
                  and non-scientific) terms used in the descriptions. Participants might also simply
                  not agree with the description provided, due to contrasting personal experiences and
                  knowledge. However, because of the decentralized process we applied, it was not possible
                  to directly address these observations, for example in individual or group discussions.
                  
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1581">(IV) Lastly, we acknowledge that we pre-tested the MCTA-tool with in total two females
                  and eight males; both women <i>white</i> and with academic background. Hence, we failed to reach a gender balance and, in
                  particular, to include female representatives of Tanzanian partners. We attribute
                  this shortcoming (i) to choosing English as working language, and (ii) to a general
                  dominance of men at the level of project coordination and/or management in the participating
                  NGO communities.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1586">With regards to differences in stakeholders’ perceptions, our findings are further
                  in line with [<a href="#R29">29</a>], who state that applying a MC(D)A-approach does not create an objective, unbiased,
                  and value-free analysis. In a nutshell: individual perspectives and subjective judgements
                  are “normal”. [-20]It is hence a methodological challenge to make these differences
                  visible instead of neglecting them. For example, we found that assessments of participants
                  in the pre-test seem substantially biased towards the technology they promote. Visualizing
                  these differences expediently is only the first step. The lack of group discussion
                  (as part of the step 8; cf. Section 2.3.) is a clear shortcoming. For example, we
                  have no specific insights into <i>why</i> differences exist and which arguments underlie the variations observed. Interpretation
                  of results (by participants and the authors) is thus largely based on guesswork.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1594">According to the final feedback, two thirds of participants believe that the MCTA
                  is also applicable within their community if further adapted (cf. Section 4.3). In
                  particular, the tool can help (i) to clarify existent doubts and expected benefits,
                  (ii) to stimulate discussions, and (iii) to compare varying assessments of projects
                  facilitating NGOs and local communities.

               </div>
               <p id="d1e1631">From a methodological perspective, combining the MC(D)A with analytical methods is
                  a viable <i>integrated approach</i> to sustainability assessment. On one hand, MC(D)A helps to structure the assessment.
                  On the other, the integration of results from analytical studies, such as MFA, SNB,
                  or laboratory analysis, allows for illustrating the performance of alternatives assessed
                  through semi-quantitative objectives of sustainability, and particularly the environmental
                  dimension.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1636">Finally, the developed method provides hands-on support through a decent set of criteria
                  and a basic assessment tool. Basic skills in Excel are the main requirement for using
                  the MCTA-tool. Nevertheless, conducting an MCTA is an extensive process that demands
                  considerable time budgets and a strong commitment from all participants.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1638">To summarize, we conclude that the MCTA is an appropriate and applicable method to
                  analyse potential effects and interrelations of different cooking and sanitation technologies
                  on household levels. The method also indicates contradictions with respect to different
                  sustainability goals. In addition, the MCTA enhances transparency about individual
                  preferences, values, doubts, and objectives among all participants, respectively stakeholders.

                           the technologies as appropriate and viable options for sustainable community development.

               </div>
               <p id="d1e1655">With respect to the latter, representatives of the German project partners generally
                  tend to be more enthusiastic about the analysed technologies while representatives
                  of the Tanzanian partners are more sceptical. This observation holds true especially
                  for the ICSs technologies, such as microgasifier and rocket stoves, and the EcoSan
                  and CaSa sanitation alternatives. Technologies that are more common and established
                  in both countries, such as biogas or septic systems, are assessed more similarly among
                  participants. Another example for varying assessments is that representatives of the
                  implementing NGOs and of the technology-developers or scientific partners tend to
                  favour the alternative that they have supported and accompanied, and, likewise, rate
                  competing technologies below average.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1657">From our hands-on experience in facilitating the MCTA pre-test, we finally hypothesise
                  that the higher the assessors diversity with respect to education, language, class,
                  and scientific or practical experiences and knowledge, (i) the more difficult the
                  process because of uncertainties about the common understanding and (ii) the more
                  important the process and the more interesting the results. Testing this hypothesis
                  could be subject of future scientific MC(D)A work.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1659">Pre-testing the MCTA with a choice group of participants can serve as a basic proof-of-concept,
                  with the method as a simple but viable sustainability assessment tool for the multi-perspective
                  evaluation of cooking and sanitation alternatives. Hence, we conclude that, by providing
                  a framework and a tool, the MCTA can effectively support case studies and relevant
                  strategic planning and decision-making. Moreover, the MCTA is also practicable for
                  other real-world applications related to small-scale cooking and sanitation technologies,
                  such as in other regions and/or for other technologies.

                  further applicable for its use in communities, methodological challenges and problems,

                  firstly, a moderated discussion about the existing catalogue of sub-criteria and,
                  thereafter, a selection of those criteria considered as the most relevant. Methodologically,
                  the “silent negotiation” could be applied in a moderated workshop, which helps to
                  cope with power-imbalances in the consortium [<a href="#R24">24</a>]. If practitioners do not aim at running through a whole assessment process, the
                  existing catalogue of criteria could also serve to structure focus group discussions
                  or community assemblies. Moderated discussions between participants can help to enhance
                  the joint understanding of arguments that underlie and explain differences in the
                  quantitative assessments. For example, a group discussion after reading the descriptions
                  can help to ease a common understanding about the information provided <i>before</i> scoring the alternatives. At the same time, such a discussion could help to alleviate
                  the time budget of the facilitator for clarifying open questions from participants.
                  With more time available, another option could be to firstly conduct scoring of alternatives
                  without description, secondly with description prepared by the planner, and finally
                  to compare and to discuss results together. Finally, and with respect to the alternatives,
                  we recommend the inclusion of technologies that are most commonly applied so far to
                  support a comparison of alternatives to the actual real-world situation.

                           According to MAVUNO [88] the objective of the organisation is "(…) to empower rural
                           people of Karagwe by (…) creating sustainable alternatives". Moreover, "projects are
                           always planned and implemented in collaboration with community members in order to
                           achieve sustainability and long term socio-economic and ecological improvement". CHEMA
                           [89] envisions "(…) to increase awareness (…) of the relationship between environmental
                           protection, sustainable agriculture and sustainable development" and "(…) to identify
                           surrounding opportunities and put them into use in a sustainable manner".
