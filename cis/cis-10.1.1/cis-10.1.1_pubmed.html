         <p class="first" id="d1e99"> We are pleased to introduce the third special issue in Challenges in Sustainability
            entitled Sustainability transformations: Emerging pathways toward safe and just futures
            for
            people and the planet.
         </p>
         <p id="d1e101"> This special issue emerged in partnership with the Canadian Society for Ecological
            Economics (CANSEE) in the context of the global COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 crisis
            has
            led to many calls for recovery, to rebuild, and to build back better to address the
            climate
            crisis. But the pandemic has exposed vulnerabilities and tensions inherent in established
            political and economic systems. Existing vulnerabilities and inequalities have exacerbated
            challenges for health and wellbeing, threatened community livelihoods, and empeded
            efforts
            to achieve ecological stability and integrity. Moreover, tensions have revealed how
            deeply
            interconnected social, economic, and environmental dimensions of wellbeing are. Simply
            rebuilding to pursue the previous path is neither tenable nor desirable. Instead,
            the
            current context provides an opportunity to pivot towards safe and just futures for
            people
            and the planet. This urgent task demands courage, creativity, and experimentation.
            What
            groups, initiatives, and visions have been seeded or are emerging from the cracks
            created
            by the pandemic? What features of our systems must be reimagined and what relationships
            must be renegotiated? And what solutions are capable of catalyzing action that supports
            this reorientation?
         </p>
         <p id="d1e103"> CANSEE supports emerging and established sustainability scholars and ecological economists
            in understanding and analyzing sustainability challenges from a perspective that is
            deeply
            critical of the status quo. Ecological economists have long emphasized the limits
            of
            attempting to address the climate crisis within an outdated growth-oriented economic
            framework that prioritizes increasing economic activity at the expense of attending
            to
            quality and ecological integrity. Thus, ecological economists have important contributions
            to make in understanding and supporting sustainability transformations towards just,
            regenerative, and ecological economies.
         </p>
         <p id="d1e105"> This special issue engages with sustainability challenges from an ecological economics
            perspective in the context of recent vulnerabilities, inequalities, injustices, and
            systemic tensions. Papers in this special issue use the lens, critiques, and tools
            of
            ecological economics to engage with problems at the intersection of ecological and
            social
            challenges. These contributions focus on multiple levels from the community to
            international scales to inform effective, inclusive, and transformative solutions.
            They are
            solution-oriented in that they apply ecological economics thinking to explore concrete
            problems that impact human and ecological wellbeing.
         </p>
         <p id="d1e107"> An important contribution of this special issue is real-world application through
            knowledge transfer. Recognizing that solutions are inherently complex and systemic,
            they
            implicate diverse actors from governments, NGOs, Indigenous groups, activists, businesses
            and civil society. Thus, we encouraged submissions that considered transformative
            solutions
            to address relationships between different groups, societies, and species in different
            regions and on different timescales. To increase the impact of their research, contributors
            developed publically accessible knowledge transfer pieces such as a policy brief,
            op-ed or
            related output where appropriate. In addition to knowledge dissemination, authors
            of these
            pieces often proposed recommendations for concrete steps needed to realize the solutions
            identified. Alongside individual papers, links to and PDFs of these accompanying knowledge
            transfer pieces are also provided.
         </p>

            and
            publishing this special issue.
