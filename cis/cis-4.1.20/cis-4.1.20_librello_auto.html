                              solutions and projects? This article suggests that one of the most important research
                              approaches capable of achieving this is the Action Research approach. This involves
                              the researcher taking on a number of roles when working with other actors (e.g. citizens,
                              farmers, local elected officials, citizen associations, government representatives.
                              . . with the specific set of actors depending upon the nature of the subject being
                              investigated and for which solutions are sought). The roles that the researcher can
                              play involve providing appropriate information to the other actors, providing counseling
                              to them, organizing and animating meetings with the actors, and accompanying the whole
                              process involving all the actors. These roles are essentially played out by the researcher
                              when the other actors request the researcher to assume whichever roles they consider
                              to be significant. The fundamental notion is that through this process the actors
                              appropriate the sustainable solutions as their own, and the researcher helps them
                              achieve this. This article is based on: a) a synthesis of pertinent research using
                              the Action Research approach (specifically in relation to sustainable agricultural
                              systems in periurban territories), and b) specific research undertaken by the two
                              co-authors of the article, all in the context of periurban agricultural systems during
                              the last 8 years, as well as on some of their publications. The necessary characteristics
                              of Action Research and the researchers involved are identified, namely: a) patience;
                              b) an emphasis on process; and c) an emphasis on participation on the part of multiple
                              actors.

                              <p id="d1e100">Increasingly, the notion of so-called `sustainable' agricultural systems raises many
                                 questions for many actors both in government and in the research community. With increasing
                                 urbanization, urban spaces penetrate more and more into what remains of their surrounding
                                 rural areas, and this territorial fringe, which has often been called a hybrid space,
                                 has become the focus of much attention in recent years 
                                 [
                                 <a href="#R01">1</a>
                                 ]
                                 .  With the introduction of the concept of sustainable development, a shift has become
                                 necessary in the food supply systems for cities and therefore ultimately in the modes
                                 of `production'. Since the end of WW2, state authorities have largely focused on industrial
                                 agriculture despite its share of negative externalities for the environment and public
                                 health; today more than ever, this agriculture which occupies the smallest spaces
                                 within agglomerations and remains the largest land user on the edges of cities, naturally
                                 leads us to rethink the agricultural reality. In relation to this, both public and
                                 private actors have a duty to be resourceful in order to highlight the fact that agriculture
                                 adjacent to and within urban agglomerations remains vital for certain population segments
                                 in both developed and developing countries 
                                 [

                                 . However, much of the research that has been emerging on this issue does not put
                                 enough emphasis on Action Research, an approach that has come directly from North
                                 America and in many respects has given rise to very relevant results.

                              <p id="d1e108">This urban (including periurban) agriculture (UPA) has to face many challenges; the
                                 researcher can in many cases contribute to the emergence of solutions, while at the
                                 same time remaining open and willing to meet the demands of the actors involved. The
                                 researcher's roles remain essential in this Action Research approach—as informant,
                                 advisor and in accompanying the actors in their construction of pertinent and, today,
                                 sustainable projects.

                                 by urban and periurban agriculture (UPA), particularly in relation to the new production
                                 systems introduced by actors practicing this UPA. We argue that Action Research can
                                 play an important role in developing more sustainable forms of UPA. Our examples from
                                 France, Canada and more recently from the Pays de Herve, Belgium, demonstrate some
                                 of the most important aspects of an Action Research approach and especially emphasize
                                 the importance of the `researcher' in this process.

                              <p id="d1e115">Action Research is a scientific approach that was not born spontaneously; its beginnings
                                 have been attributed to social scientists, from the 19th century and the first quarter
                                 of the 20th century 
                                 [
                                 <a href="#R03">3</a>
                                 ]
                                 . The use of the term by Kurt Lewin in 1933 ultimately defined the fundamental concept
                                 
                                 [
                                 <a href="#R04">4</a>
                                 ]
                                 . Action Research highlights the importance of a methodological approach in which
                                 the ”individual” is central to success both in terms of the individual researcher
                                 and the dynamics of the relationships in which the individual researcher finds him
                                 or herself.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e123">Thus, this creates an interaction between the researcher and the object of the research;
                                 namely, the social group at the center of the research. There has since been a proliferation
                                 of work using the Action Research approach, especially after the Second World War,
                                 and it is occupying an increasingly significant place in the scientific world particularly
                                 because of the interest in finding practical solutions to various issues.

                                 systematic collection of observable and verifiable data, in order to describe, explain,
                                 anticipate and plan future events. Research and action are thus intimately connected
                                 within the same activity, taking as a reference point the group of actors (individuals
                                 and collective actors such as associations, municipalities…)  on which the research
                                 is focused.

                                 to everyday life, and the researcher must therefore be fully involved in the projects
                                 aimed at transforming the social reality

                                 and influence in the phenomena being studied are taken into consideration. Finally,
                                 the ethical dimension of the researcher is highlighted in this research approach,

                              <p id="d1e139">Increasingly agriculture is losing ground against the relentless advance of the city,
                                 and the issue of the conservation of farmland is one of the first challenges that
                                 has to be resolved. In Canada, legislation has been put in place to preserve agricultural
                                 land (1973 in British Columbia and 1977 in Quebec as well as strong guidelines for
                                 municipalities and regions in Ontario from 1978 onwards); in the United States, in
                                 the 1960s, considerable efforts were also put in place to conserve farmland in several
                                 States

                              <p id="d1e147">In France, the inclusion of UPA has played an important role in territorial planning
                                 and development policies since the mid-1970s, and a more formal approach began to
                                 be integrated into these policies after 2000, both at national and regional levels

                                 . In Wallonia, it was only in March 2014, that the <i>Code wallon de l'agriculture</i> was put in place; the objectives of this Code appear to be very pertinent but for
                                 the moment real actions have yet to be undertaken.

                              <p id="d1e155">Overall, however, the issue of dealing with UPA has become widely recognized and integrated
                                 into the thinking of public authorities, largely because of the multitude of functions
                                 that these agricultures support for the benefit of society, including food production,
                                 leisure, environmental (ecosystem services) and residential functions. These functions
                                 can often be in conflict with each other and give rise to conflicts that several governments
                                 have attempted to control and reduce. Each function can be associated with different
                                 actors each with their own perspectives and interests to defend. Nevertheless, it
                                 is the agricultural production function which suffers the brunt of the advancing urban
                                 area, and despite attempts to curb these losses, it is clear that losses of farmland
                                 continue even where there is strong legislation to conserve farmland resources. And
                                 when farmland is lost so are the many other functions that farmland and farming activities
                                 support.

                                 the ground, we have to recognize that losses of farmland are still significant, amounting
                                 to up to 80% in some municipalities over a relatively short period of time

                                 the Pays de Herve follow along these lines and in 30 years (1980 to 2010), this part
                                 of the Walloon region has shown a 70.4% drop in farmland area

                              <p id="d1e168">One of the major challenges facing UPA is to be able to ensure its sustainability,
                                 and not just through the type of agricultural land conservation legislation that exists
                                 in several Canadian provinces and the other efforts made in France more recently.

                                 but enormous efforts are still required in Wallonia. Another challenge concerns what
                                 has been happening to agricultural activity in France, where over 200 farms disappear
                                 each week

                                 a successor. In relation to this, Action Research can become part of the solution
                                 and contribute to the development of agricultural development plans aimed at the development
                                 of sustainable agricultural systems including the creation of improved incomes.

                              <p id="d1e175">This situation really seems more than worrying and challenging, and it raises the
                                 question of the relationship between the city and its agricultures (UPA). This in
                                 turn requires a much better understanding of the relationship between citizens and
                                 farming (and food production generally including urban gardens of different types)
                                 in and around cities, and of the expectations of citizens. Indeed, more and more farmers
                                 are questioning the challenges related to this cohabitation between the farming population
                                 and non-farm population, such as how to respond to new social expectations, related
                                 on the one hand to environmental issues and on the other hand to the mistrust born
                                 of the various health crises that have shaken the agricultural world. Developing sustainable
                                 agricultural areas and farm activities requires much more than land use planning even
                                 though appropriate land use planning structures and regulations are important. The
                                 construction of agricultural development plans is what is needed to complement land
                                 use planning, as has been happening in Quebec, Canada, since 2008.

                              <p id="d1e177">Periurban agriculture has had to contend with continued urban expansion, including
                                 urban sprawl in many countries despite land use planning. Periurban farms, as elsewhere,
                                 also have to cope with difficulties in their functioning, partly related to agricultural
                                 machinery becoming larger and larger making it increasingly more difficult to maintain
                                 their farm operations (i.e. the globally competitive and capitalist form of agriculture
                                 that has become so important in many Western countries) because of traffic circulation
                                 problems in these territories. Furthermore, the isolation, splitting up and fragmentation
                                 of farms are all challenges that have to be taken into consideration on behalf of
                                 and by these farmers. Furthermore, in some jurisdictions such as Ontario, Canada,
                                 agricultural land use planning has favored the large scale productivist and capitalist
                                 system of agriculture in areas where the property parcels are very large; land use
                                 planning has tended to refuse breaking such property parcels into smaller parcels
                                 because of earlier concerns over ex-urbanization processes. However, this approach
                                 makes it more difficult for some types of emerging farms (such as small scale organic
                                 farms and small farms that use limited agricultural machinery) to become established
                                 in such areas despite an increasing market for their produce; and land rental is limited
                                 because of the lack of legislation permitting secure farmland tenure in such areas.

                              <p id="d1e179">Added to this is an important lack of knowledge of the farming profession by citizens
                                 who often continue to see agriculture as being made up of the fermes d'antan, and
                                 who remain very demanding in terms of services provided to them by farmers. Farmers
                                 often hope to find solutions to their problems in these periurban areas through infrastructure
                                 development, which in reality is more often detrimental to agriculture.

                              <p id="d1e181">All of this is reinforced by the lack of attractiveness of the farming profession,
                                 which creates problems in terms of manpower, as well as has already been mentioned
                                 the commonly held negative image of this profession.

                              <p id="d1e184">In addition to these challenges are added questions related to energy, which will
                                 become pressing in the very near future—how to deal with the energy crisis, what are
                                 the alternatives to replace fossil fuels, and how can agriculture respond?

                              <p id="d1e186">Furthermore, farming is also facing the inevitable consequences in the European Union
                                 that the Common Agricultural Policy has created over a long period of time of always
                                 trying to encourage farmers to produce more involving more input use that is harmful
                                 to the environment, all of which has led to a reorganization of agricultural production
                                 systems that have generated many negative externalities: various types of pollution,
                                 soil erosion and increased water use (agriculture is a major consumer of water). The
                                 ecological impacts remain a challenge to be met around the world. Many of these challenges
                                 are reflected in the very concepts of sustainable development—what are the appropriate
                                 solutions from the social, economic and environmental perspectives?

                                 becomes part of a process involving many other actors and in no way should the researcher
                                 control that process. The researcher essentially assumes the following roles to different
                                 degrees depending on the circumstances of the project:

                                 farmland and agricultural production systems. This means ensuring that the actors

                              <p id="d1e218">The role of the researcher and especially his or her personality remains fundamental
                                 in Action Research methodology. The researcher must be prepared to listen to all the
                                 actors, and to guide them and especially to demonstrate continuously the value of
                                 their involvement. The researcher's personal commitment and level of involvement are
                                 a `guarantee' of success in constructing and managing Action Research.

                              <p id="d1e220">Nevertheless, it is not always easy for the researcher to get the message across;
                                 in our case both to farmers, who often maintain their preconceptions, and to the other
                                 actors who also often have their own preconceptions. Above all, it requires that the
                                 demands of the other actors are well known. The objectives and solutions that are
                                 developed as well as the various actions need to be developed by all actors and the
                                 researcher can contribute by clearly helping them be defined and contributing to their
                                 modification as the process unfolds. The researcher must carry out his or her roles
                                 and meet the demands of the people involved. This is clearly not at all like the traditional
                                 research roles involving the analysis of different types of data and the preparation
                                 of reports, scientific publications and communications: all of these are possible
                                 through Action Research, but generally they take more time and necessitate much patience
                                 on the part of the researcher.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e222">Continuous support is essential throughout the process, since solutions are always
                                 emerging; but it is also the responsibility of the farmers and other stakeholders
                                 to be involved, because the probability of success is quite real as long as the actors
                                 give their full support. Besides this support, which is provided continuously in group
                                 meetings, the researcher's presence on the ground is also essential, both for the
                                 farmers and other stakeholders. Insofar as statistical analyses alone do not necessarily
                                 reflect the reality, `cross-checking' is needed to better ”understand” the reality
                                 and therefore to move to action accordingly. Finally, some special requirements are
                                 needed on the part of the researcher, namely the three `Ps' of Sustainable Development,
                                 i.e. Process, Patience and Participation:

                                          on the responsibility of involving all stakeholders, both farmers and other actors
                                          in the territory (politicians and citizen groups as well as others). The ultimate
                                          goal is that each person appropriates the importance of the ”multi-functionality”
                                          of agricultural land (and farm activities) and their role in environmental issues.
                                          To achieve this, initially the researcher can organize discussion groups, which allow
                                          the emphasis to be placed on the ”knowledge” of each person; note that a whole world
                                          often separates farmers from urban citizens, who because they do not know the farmers
                                          for the most part, are not able to appreciate how agriculture has become an irreplaceable

                                          negative externalities of farming by the farmers themselves. Thus, it is up to the
                                          researcher to provide them with the appropriate elements so that they can fully appreciate
                                          these negative externalities.

                                          patience; any researcher must be able to carry out his or her research but above all
                                          else from a sustainable development perspective must be able to move the whole process
                                          towards possible sustainable solutions. By involving all stakeholders, the researcher
                                          through the Action Research approach suggested in this text moves towards a constructive
                                          and sustainable output with all the other actors, particularly with the purpose of
                                          achieving sustainable farmland and farm activities through UPA. It is the other actors
                                          who must play a major role in constructing these solutions and must therefore appropriate
                                          the ownership of these solutions. So investment of time, listening and engagement
                                          are the key qualities inherent to the researcher in the construction of positive results
                                          through Action Research, and this is achieved without imposing his or her own ideas

                                 and this is why the researcher must take account of any given territory's own specificities.

                                 are taking place, and as well to support other projects in other territories.

                                 a great deal of patience, be prepared to listen attentively to everyone and be prepared
                                 to make a real investment in the project when the actors request it.  The purpose
                                 remains first, the search for permanent solutions and second, to ensure that the different
                                 actors are each satisfied with the process and outcomes.  The researcher must make
                                 a major commitment to the key players, in our case the farmers, but without putting
                                 aside local officials. Finally, the researcher assumes the roles of counselor, of
                                 providing advice, and of accompanying the actors in the process, without imposing
                                 his or her own views and carrying out these roles only when the other actors ask the
                                 researcher to carry out these roles
