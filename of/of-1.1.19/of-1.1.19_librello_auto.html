                              by enabling distributed manufacturing of substitutes for both specialty equipment
                              and conventional mass-manufactured products. The rate of 3-D printable designs under
                              open licenses is growing exponentially and there arealready hundreds of designs applicable
                              to small-scale organic farming. It has also been hypothesized that this technology
                              could assist sustainable development in rural communities that rely on small-scale
                              organic agriculture. To gauge the present utility of open-source 3-D printers in this
                              organic farm context both in the developed and developing world, this paper reviews
                              the current open-source designs available and evaluates the ability of low-cost 3-D
                              printers to be effective at reducing the economic costs of farming.This study limits
                              the evaluation of open-source 3-D printers to only the most-developed fused filament
                              fabrication of the bioplastic polylactic acid (PLA). PLA is a strong biodegradable
                              and recyclable thermoplastic appropriate for a range of representative products, which
                              are grouped into five categories of prints: handtools, food processing, animal management,
                              water management and hydroponics. The advantages and shortcomings of applying 3-D
                              printing to each technology are evaluated. The results show a general izabletechnical
                              viability and economic benefit to adopting open-source 3-D printing for any of the
                              technologies, although the individual economic impact is highly dependent on needs
                              and frequency of use on a specific farm. Capital costs of a 3-D printer may be saved
                              from on-farm printing of a single advanced analytical instrument in a day or replacing
                              hundreds of inexpensive products over a year. In order for the full potential of open-source
                              3-D printing to be realized to assist organic farm economic resiliency and self-sufficiency,
                              future work is outlined in five core areas: designs of 3-D printable objects, 3-D
                              printing materials, 3-Dprinters, software and 3-D printable repositories.</span></div>

                              <p id="d1e84">World wide, the area of organic farmland continues to increase significantly [<a href="#R1">1</a>, <a href="#R2">2</a>]. Approximately a third of the world's organically managed land (i.e. 11 million
                                 hectares) is located in developing countries and nearly half of the world's organic
                                 producers are in Africa [<a href="#R2">2</a>]. In the developing world in particular, these farms are owned by relatively resource-poor
                                 landholders. However, such small farms may contribute significantly to agricultural
                                 production, food security, rural poverty reduction and biodiversity conservation,
                                 despite the historic challenges small farmers face in terms of access to both productive
                                 resources and markets [<a href="#R3">3</a>]. In addition, small farms in the developing world must overcome new challenges including
                                 adapting to climate change, market volatility and risks and vulnerabilities associated
                                 with integration into high-value chains [<a href="#R3">3</a>, <a href="#R4">4</a>, <a href="#R5">5</a>]. There is some disagreement in the literature as to whether investments in infrastructure
                                 and technical efficiency alone are sufficient to address the negative impacts of climate
                                 change for developing-world farmers [<a href="#R6">6</a>, <a href="#R7">7</a>]. Although, it is clear that these challenges can at least in part be overcome by
                                 increasing the profit of organic farming in the developing world, which in turn is
                                 influenced by increasing revenue (e.g. by increasing yields, selling in more lucrative
                                 markets, etc.) or by reducing costs. Many organic farmers in both the developed and
                                 developing world save money and produce high-quality crops with few or no off-farm
                                 inputs, but most producers rely on at least some purchased inputs [<a href="#R8">8</a>]. In addition, those farmers above the level of poverty subsistence also purchase
                                 their own equipment.  As one of the costly inputs for organic agriculture is tools
                                 and equipment, this study investigates reducing farm-related tool costs for organic
                                 farms using open-source 3-D printing. In this way, distributed on-site manufacturing
                                 of tools and equipment can aid in organic farm self-sufficiency.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e117">There is a growing body of evidence that low-cost open-source 3-D printers [<a href="#R9">9</a>, <a href="#R10">10</a>] can reduce costs not only for high-end products like scientific equipment [<a href="#R11">11</a>, <a href="#R12">12</a>], but also for conventional mass-manufactured consumer goods [<a href="#R13">13</a>, <a href="#R14">14</a>, <a href="#R15">15</a>, <a href="#R16">16</a>]. There has been an explosion of open-source scientific equipment [<a href="#R12">12</a>, <a href="#R17">17</a>, <a href="#R18">18</a>, <a href="#R19">19</a>, <a href="#R20">20</a>, <a href="#R21">21</a>, <a href="#R22">22</a>] and the number of free consumer designs has been rising exponentially [<a href="#R14">14</a>]. There is also a body of work proposing that 3-D printers would also be useful for
                                 sustainable development [<a href="#R23">23</a>, <a href="#R24">24</a>, <a href="#R25">25</a>]. While the application of 3-D printing in developing countries is still at an early
                                 stage, the technology application promises vast solutions to existing problems [<a href="#R23">23</a>, <a href="#R24">24</a>]. For example, most small farmers in the developing world use labor-intensive agricultural
                                 hand tools; Ishengoma and Mtaho hypothesize that superior tools can be developed with
                                 3-D printing improving the efficiency of agriculture in the developing world [<a href="#R25">25</a>]. At the same time it appears likely that the cost-saving nature of distributed manufacturing
                                 of 3-D printing could also benefit developed-world small-scale organic farms.

                                    <p id="d1e196">Following lessons developed in free and open source software [<a href="#R26">26</a>, <a href="#R27">27</a>, <a href="#R28">28</a>, <a href="#R29">29</a>, <a href="#R30">30</a>], the RepRap project has undergone a rapid technical evolution and offers the lowest
                                       cost 3-D printing equipment, which is also capable of printing its own replacement
                                       parts [<a href="#R9">9</a>, <a href="#R10">10</a>, <a href="#R14">14</a>, <a href="#R31">31</a>, <a href="#R32">32</a>]. The early RepRaps used a Cartesian design, however, several RepRap 3-D printers
                                       now use delta robot designs similar to those used for pick and place in the electronics
                                       industry [<a href="#R33">33</a>]. Delta RepRap 3-D printers have a stationary print bed and an extruder that moves
                                       in all 3 axes.  The 3-D printer works by taking plastic filament into the extruder,
                                       melting it and depositing a 2-D pattern on the substrate. The extruder is then moved
                                       up a fraction of a mm (normally 0.1–0.35 mm) and the next layer of the 3-D printed
                                       object is deposited. The process repeats until the entire object has been fabricated
                                       in solid plastic. Delta RepRap 3-D printers use standard AC electricity to run and
                                       while printing consume <span class="inline-formula">

                                    <p id="d1e240">Although delta 3-D printers are operationally less intuitive, they require less time
                                       and are easier to assemble, require fewer parts and have lower capital costs. The
                                       MOST (Michigan Tech Open Sustainability Lab) Delta RepRap has three linear actuators
                                       arranged vertically around a circle <a href="#Fig1">1</a>. The MOST Delta RepRap costs under $450 in parts and can be built in approximately
                                       eight hours once the bill of materials (BOM) has been collected by inexperienced first-time
                                       3-D printers [<a href="#R34">34</a>, <a href="#R35">35</a>] (the ability of new users to build working machines has been demonstrated over 100
                                       times in a number of contexts from college classes to seminars and hack-a-thons).
                                       This type of 3-D printer was chosen for this study because of the value—it has low
                                       capital costs for the quality of the prints and the build volume (250 mm in radius
                                       and 270 mm high) provided. In addition, farmers, who are generally handy at fixing
                                       equipment, would best be served by a 3-D printer they could maintain themselves. Having
                                       access to a machine that they can take apart, fix, upgrade and try their own modifications
                                       on provides far more value at a significantly lower cost than a conventional tooling
                                       arrangement with warranties that simply may not be available in all parts of the world.
                                       In addition, such RepRap technology can contribute to farm self-sufficiency. All of
                                       the MOST Delta RepRap design files, schematics, build instructions and bill of materials
                                       are available on Appropedia for free  [<a href="#R34">34</a>]. The results of this study are not limited to this particular RepRap, however, all
                                       examples can be printed with it—and most other (full size) RepRap variants.

                                    <p id="d1e295">RepRaps typically print in polylactic acid (PLA) or acrylonitrile butadiene styrene
                                       (ABS) for a wide range of colors. In this study, PLA will be evaluated as it is a
                                       stronger plastic than ABS;  RepRap printed parts have an average tensile strength
                                       of  28.5 MPa for ABS and 56.6 MPa for PLA [<a href="#R44">44</a>]. PLA is a bio-based plastic, made up of a repeating chain of lactic acid. It is
                                       recyclable using conventional methods. In addition, PLA can be composted like other
                                       organic matter [<a href="#R45">45</a>]. When composted, the moisture and heat in the compost pile break the PLA polymer
                                       chains apart, creating smaller polymer fragments, and finally, lactic acid. However,
                                       abiotic hydrolysis has been shown to be a rate limiting step in the biodegradation
                                       process of PLA and organisms were not able to accelerate depolymerization significantly
                                       by the action of their enzymes [<a href="#R46">46</a>]. Both the smaller polymer fragments and lactic acid act as nutrients for microorganisms
                                       in the compost. As lactic acid is widely found in nature, a large number of organisms
                                       metabolize it into carbon dioxide, water and humus, an important component of soil

                                    <p id="d1e462">Many tools that may be useful for organic farmers are larger than the build volume
                                       of the MOST delta RepRap (a cylinder of 250 mm in radius and 270 mm high), yet can
                                       be created by it by printing individual components of the tool and then assembling
                                       them with non-printed, readily available components. An example of this is the tri-claw
                                       apple picker (Figure <a href="#Fig2">2</a>).  The tool helps reduce labor in apple picking by eliminating the need to use a
                                       stepladder for high apples. The four-bar-linkage claw (Figure <a href="#Fig2">2</a>A) is closed by a sliding collar attached, by another four-bar, to each of the three
                                       fingers (Figure <a href="#Fig2">2</a>B). It is operated by pulling the cord visible in the lower right, which is knotted
                                       onto a sliding collar further down the pole. The collar is sprung to return the fingers
                                       to the open position. The apple picker print is threaded to fit a standard broom handle,
                                       which can be used when needed.  For a longer pole, farmers can duct tape the broom
                                       handle to any pole that is physically manageable. The apple picker has several deficiencies
                                       however, that keep it from being as useful for the community as it potentially could
                                       be. It is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Non-Commercial license.
                                       That means organic farmers can print and use it for their own use, but not sell it.
                                       Strictly speaking the CC-BY-NC license is not a true open source license [<a href="#R72">72</a>]. In addition, only the STL files are shared, meaning farmers can print this version,
                                       but not easily make alterations (e.g. adjust fingers for optimal picking of other
                                       types of fruit). Finally, even if the source files had been shared, they were from
                                       an expensive professional closed-source CAD package (<span class="inline-formula">

                                       are unlikely to have the time to develop the skill for, nor justify the budget for
                                       purchasing such a CAD software package.

                                    <p id="d1e483">Fortunately, there are several options for quality CAD software with shallow learning
                                       curves available as completely free and open-source software, such as OpenSCAD. OpenSCAD
                                       allows farmers to customize a design for their exact needs with minimal effort because
                                       of the script based parametric nature of OpenSCAD. OpenSCAD will be the primary solid
                                       modeling tool of choice for the majority of the designs presented below. For example,
                                       a customizable shovel handle (Figure 3) can be used as a replacement part for a broken
                                       shovel handle. In addition, it can be used on an existing tool with no handle to apply
                                       greater leverage, comfort and wrist relief, which prevents long-term injuries from
                                       repetitive motions (e.g. rotator cuff tears from digging). As farming tools have different
                                       diameters and farmers want different sized grips, depending on their hand sizes, all

                                       possible to load in multiple colors of filament to improve aesthetics, enable artistic
                                       expression or use a company's logo colors during a print (Figure <a href="#Fig3">3</a>). Finally, the cost of the handle printed with commercial filament is less than a
                                       third of commercial plastic D-grip handles [<a href="#R53">53</a>]. Being able to make custom products for a fraction of the cost of commercial products
                                       is a well established benefit of distributed manufacturing with 3-D printing [<a href="#R14">14</a>]. It should be pointed out that this calculation does not involve any labor cost
                                       as, after the file is sent to the printer and even if the print itself takes hours,
                                       a well-tuned 3-D printer does not require any human observation (e.g. the farmer can
                                       go about other tasks as usual and only go back to the printer to collect his finished
                                       product). For farms employing workers, time spent searching for free designs, customizing
                                       them, tweaking print settings and maintaining the 3-D printer would need to be included

                                       <a href="#Fig4">4</a>). This shovel design enables printing handle components that fit together to extend
                                       the reach to the length a farmer requires.  The mechanical strength of PLA [<a href="#R44">44</a>] makes its use possible in tools that can bear a significant load if the parts are
                                       printed at 100% or with significant exterior thicknesses. This shovel could be used
                                       for light work—such as for adding to a compost pile, however, this shovel would not
                                       be appropriate for digging in hard soil. For such applications a metal tool is needed.
                                       Fortunately, an open-source 3-D printer capable of printing in steel and aluminum
                                       has been developed, which is essentially an upside-down MOST delta RepRap where the

                                       high-density polyethylene (HDPE) [<a href="#R76">76</a>], Laywood [<a href="#R77">77</a>], Laybrick [<a href="#R78">78</a>], high impact polystyrene [<a href="#R79">79</a>],  PEEK [<a href="#R80">80</a>], polyphenylsulfone [<a href="#R80">80</a>], polyetherimide [<a href="#R80">80</a>], polyoxymethylene [<a href="#R81">81</a>], Polykey PLA HS [<a href="#R82">82</a>], PLA HS NX [<a href="#R82">82</a>], Polykey PPGF [<a href="#R82">82</a>], PPMF [<a href="#R82">82</a>], Polykey PA6GFV0 [<a href="#R82">82</a>], polycarbonate and polyvinyl alcohol. For some of the high temperature filaments
                                       a different hot end on the RepRap is needed, but this does not increase the capital
                                       costs of the RepRap by more than a few tens of dollars. These alternative materials
                                       extend the range of useful 3-D printable farming applications.

                                       entire food presses can be manufactured. Consider a cassava press (Figure <a href="#Fig8">8</a>), which is a tool used in many parts of the developing world for increasing the longevity
                                       of food by pressing part, or all of the liquid out of the food. Although many cassava
                                       presses are large, this is an example of a household sized one. In addition, with
                                       minor design changes the press could be adapted for other uses or expanded to the
                                       printer diameter (up to 500 mm).

                                    <p id="d1e715">According to the World Bank there are still over 1.2 billion people (approximately
                                       20% of the world's population) that do not have access to electricity, almost all
                                       of whom live in developing countries [<a href="#R83">83</a>]. Because of this, much of the automated food processing that  is taken for granted
                                       in developed countries is still carried out by hand in the global south. For example,
                                       shelling corn (maize) is a chore done by hand in much of the rural developing world.
                                       For some time there have been commercial corn shellers that can save people hours
                                       of labor. However, maize comes in different sizes so different shellers are needed
                                       in different regions—and the various DIY shellers are a major task to fabricate. Using
                                       the OpenSCAD design code, corn shellers (Figure <a href="#Fig9">9</a>) can be customized for an exact location and corn type and 3-D printed in a short

                                    <p id="d1e1167">As the market for organic meat in the developed world has climbed in recent years
                                       there has been a significant increase in organic poultry farming in developing countries
                                       [<a href="#R84">84</a>]. In addition to this, in the developing world, poultry farming is a popular project
                                       among small-scale organic farmers as the returns can be realized within a short period
                                       (approximately 1.5–2 months) [<a href="#R85">85</a>]. Unfortunately, many of these projects fail due to disease outbreaks. Disease results
                                       in large numbers of poultry fatalities and poor production performance in both eggs
                                       and meat, which can cause financial losses to already poor farmers, and also increase
                                       human infection [<a href="#R86">86</a>]. The majority of chicken diseases are transmitted through contaminated chicken waste.
                                       Appropriate chicken feed holders can help keep feed isolated from contaminated feces,
                                       minimizing outbreaks of disease. Thus, after corn is shelled using the print in section
                                       then ground, it can be fed to chickens using 3-D printable chicken feed holders (Figure
                                       <a href="#Fig10">10</a>). This improves the economic viability of raising poultry by raising yield, but also
                                       reducing investment in treating sick birds.

                                       on an organic farm, or harvested from the field on a small-scale, need to be field
                                       dressed and skinned in order to obtain high-quality, unspoiled meat. This process
                                       can be interrupted due to dull/blunt or improperly sized cutting blades. A dressing
                                       tool can be printed that mounts a replaceable and inexpensive utility blade on a 3-D
                                       printed handle with a guard (Figure <a href="#Fig12">12</a>). This tool enables the farmer to cut only what is needed in a safe manner as it
                                       allows cutting just beneath the skin without puncturing organs. The replaceable blade
                                       ensures ease of use and the lowest possible costs, while ensuring field dressing is
                                       faster and safer than with a traditional blade. Another example for this application
                                       is a tool used for gutting an animal (Figure <a href="#Fig13">13</a>). The tool is both customizable, so it can be sized appropriately for the animal
                                       being processed, and can be printed in its entirety. The tool is inserted into the
                                       animal's alimentary canal, twisted and pulled to remove a portion of the intestine,
                                       which can then be tied off and removed. This process eliminates the need for cutting
                                       around the area with a knife, making the field dressing process quicker, safer, and
                                       easier. Printing this tool cost far less than purchasing it commercially.

                                    <p id="d1e1225">A critical resource on many organic farms is water, and 3-D printing components can
                                       help assist water management on a small farm. For example, an adapter (Figure <a href="#Fig14">14</a>) is used to split water streams from a common garden hose nozzle. The splitter can
                                       be customized to any desired size, and can be paired with duplicates of itself to
                                       enable the construction of complex irrigation systems. The purely PLA 3-D printed
                                       version, however, is likely to leak unless heat treated, which may not be acceptable
                                       for many farms. As PLA melts at low temperatures a quasi-permanent bond can be created
                                       by heating the metal hose end and then screwing it to the bottom of the adapter. This
                                       will deform the PLA, which will then form a watertight bond directly to the nozzle.
                                       In order to ensure a water tight seal that can be undone,  a gasket is needed, either
                                       purchased or printed (Figure <a href="#Fig15">15</a>). Customizable gaskets can be directly printed using constrained extruder drivers
                                       printing elastomers such as `ninjaflex' or using caulkstruders. A caulkstruder is
                                       an end effector that mounts any type of caulk and pushes it out in a controlled fashion
                                       like a syringe. This is a heavy device and cannot be mounted easily on the end effector
                                       of a delta 3-D printer. However, a recent innovation with the delta printer design
                                       turns the printer upside-down such that the tool (caulkstruder) is fixed in place
                                       and the workpiece moves below it [<a href="#R87">87</a>] (Figure <a href="#Fig16">16</a>). This convertible RepRap is capable of a long list of other functions including
                                       PCB milling, cutting, plotting, liquid handling, etc. using a collection of primarily
                                       3-D printable magnet mountable hot-swap tool heads [<a href="#R87">87</a>]. Thus, hundreds of gaskets can be printed from a single tube of caulk. These are
                                       more complex, less-tested machines that may be useful for organic farmers in the future.
                                       To enable gasket manufacturing on farm using only standard FFF printing in PLA, it
                                       is also possible to print a mold in PLA and fill it with silicone to produce silicone
                                       gaskets [<a href="#R88">88</a>].

                                    <p id="d1e1267">Gaskets made by either process are also useful for larger applications such as the
                                       contoured spigot for a five gallon bucket (Figure <a href="#Fig17">17</a>). Spigots manufactured for self-attachment typically rely on large gaskets to maintain
                                       a seal, which works with varying success on the curved surface of a bucket or barrel.
                                       By modeling a bucket with just its top and bottom diameters and its average thickness,
                                       it is easy to design a spigot with contours that fit the targeted water container
                                       and, with 3-D printing, a custom spigot attachment can be fabricated. The main attachment
                                       is reasonably easy to print and typical modification requires changing only four parameters
                                       in OpenSCAD. However, this design is also a good example of the generally unfinished
                                       nature of open-source design projects. Although the design of the connection is robust
                                       the spigot itself can be improved significantly.

                                    <p id="d1e1272">It is relatively well established that organic farms can conserve water using a drip
                                       irrigation system, which allows for precise application of water into the root zones
                                       of targeted plants while minimizing runoff-related losses or deep percolation. Although
                                       savings are possible, many farmers use drip irrigation to improve their water use
                                       efficiency—improving the yield for the amount of water used. The use of a drip irrigation
                                       system, whether in the developed or developing world, depends primarily on economics
                                       [<a href="#R89">89</a>]. The following must be considered: the capital and labor costs of installing drip
                                       irrigation, costs and returns of production, and the price of and access to water.
                                       Farmers who use the technology may experience increased yields and higher income per
                                       unit of land as, depending on the crop, water applied under drip irrigation is approximately
                                       half as much as under flood irrigation. To optimize an irrigation system made up of
                                       any of the standard above-ground quarter-inch tubing that connects up to sprayers,
                                       drip feeds, and drop hoses, garden stakes (Figure <a href="#Fig18">18</a>) can be used. They are parametric and can be customized for the soil and watering
                                       conditions of any organic farm. There are many other water management related open-source
                                       3-D printable designs, such as soil moisture sensors, watering can nozzles and spouts,
                                       liquid level sensors and rain water collection devices, including early work on different
                                       types of treadle pumps. Perhaps the most interesting progress is water-related 3-D
                                       printable designs, however, is in the more high-tech area of hydroponics.

                                       to use hydroponic systems and still conform with organic principles [<a href="#R90">90</a>] and philosophies by using i) nutrient solutions derived from acceptable organic
                                       sources, ii) biological pathogen control measures and iii) recirculating hydroponic

                                       sustainable system of crop production than classical soil-based organic systems [<a href="#R95">95</a>].  The environmental benefits of organic farming and food systems are well established
                                       [<a href="#R96">96</a>]: they contribute to climate change mitigation [<a href="#R97">97</a>] because of improved energy efficiency and biodiversity conservation [<a href="#R98">98</a>, <a href="#R99">99</a>, <a href="#R100">100</a>]. In order to improve the environmental benefits of organic hydroponics even further,
                                       distributed manufacturing with open-source 3-D printers can be used as there is already
                                       evidence that it has a lower environmental impact than conventional manufacturing
                                       [<a href="#R101">101</a>, <a href="#R102">102</a>].

                                       the top of the system where it drips out of a 3-D printed head into the chain of bottles

                                       and replace components that cost more than $10, like a hydroponic halo ring (Figure
                                       <a href="#Fig20">20</a>). The pores in this device ensure that the containers are irrigated with water and
                                       nutrient solutions evenly. If used in conventional soil-based applications, three
                                       stakes can be added to the ring and it can be used for existing plants by slipping
                                       the stalk through the gap. Again the OpenSCAD code can be easily altered to fit any
                                       organic farming application or plant type (e.g. changing gap length for more mature
                                       plants). There are also several different versions of hydroponic plant pots (Figure
                                       <a href="#Fig21">21</a>). Again, a farmer can evolve the open-source design for his specific application
                                       and print it for lower costs than purchasing from a conventional supplier. Finally
                                       a more complex version of a peristaltic pump (Figure <a href="#Fig22">22</a>), which can be used to pump the water nutrient solution for hydroponics. Peristaltic
                                       pumps work off a single motor and have the advantage of fluid never coming into contact
                                       with mechanical parts of the machine as it is contained within a flexible tube (Figure
                                       <a href="#Fig22">22</a>). As peristaltic pumps have several uses, including as 3-D printer extruders, there
                                       are many different designs already freely shared under open-source licenses.

                                       to customization of equipment for organic farmers, and this has a value, although
                                       it is difficult to quantify. However, all of them offer direct cost advantages over
                                       purchasing commercial equivalents. This economic advantage mirrors past analysis that
                                       looked at more generic consumer products [<a href="#R14">14</a>]. In all of the preceding cases it was assumed that virgin commercial PLA filament

                                       even if shipping and taxes are ignored.

                                       as such economics is heavily dependent on the use of the printer [<a href="#R14">14</a>]. Although a single water testing platform (Figure <a href="#Fig6">6</a>) pays for the entire 3-D printer 4-8 times over, hundreds of irrigation stakes (Figure
                                       18) would need to be printed to cover the capital costs of the 3-D printer. It is
                                       obviously also much easier to justify the capital cost of the printer if a recyclebot
                                       is available either on farm in or locally. Each organic farmer would need to evaluate
                                       his own potential use based on his applications and needs. It is likely that there
                                       could be one or several highly utilized products or components that would economically
                                       justify purchasing the 3-D printer, and then the other products it manufactured would
                                       simply be extra side benefits adding to the profitability of the investment.

                                 and recovery will all enable a more plug-and-play experience for non-3-D printer experts.
                                 Slicers need to be improved to enable fill pattern and density optimization based
                                 on finite element analysis of printed components under realistic loads. In addition,
                                 printing support must be improved to minimize filament use, time and energy printing
                                 and part clean up while ensuring geometric integrity. Further, printer settings including
                                 material selection must be optimized in real time for the specific geometries of a
                                 given print.

                              <p id="d1e1589">Finally, the free repositories that store 3-D printable files (e.g. Youmagine, Libre3D,
                                 etc.) must all be improved. This can be done by improving search, tagging, licensing,
                                 easing the uploading of derivatives, and integrating OpenSCAD customizers in addition
                                 to STL renderers. The repositories need to go beyond simply storing STLs or even OpenSCAD
                                 code and begin to store information about optimal slicing, control and materials.
                                 Printed components need to be vetted and tested in a way that enables greater confidence
                                 in the printer that the print will perform as intended. This information can all be
                                 shared in a way to enable innovation [<a href="#R139">139</a>] and further sustainable development for everyone. In some cases it will be necessary
                                 for independent labs and government agencies to provide this form of testing and approval,
                                 but in other cases the solutions can be crowd-sourced [<a href="#R140">140</a>, <a href="#R141">141</a>, <a href="#R142">142</a>, <a href="#R143">143</a>, <a href="#R140">140</a>]. For example, cabbage white butterflies are known to be antisocial when they are
                                 laying their eggs, so if decoy butterflies [<a href="#R145">145</a>] are printed, it can be hypothesized that they might reduce pest damage in cabbage
                                 crops. The number of variations on such an experiment that 3-D printing affords is
                                 substantial (e.g. shape, size, type, density etc.) so a crowd sourced experiment could
                                 be helpful for developing an inexpensive 3-D printed solution to this crop pest.

                              <p id="d1e1616">The results of this review show a generalizable technical viability and economic benefit
                                 for  adopting open-source 3-D printing for any of the organic farm technologies reviewed,
                                 although the individual economic impact is highly dependent on needs and frequency
                                 of use on a specific farm. Despite liming the applications of open-source 3-D printing
                                 to only the most-developed fused filament fabrication of the bioplastic polylactic
                                 acid, five categories of prints : 1) hand tools, 2) food processing, 3)  animal management,
                                 4) water management and 5) hydroponics were all found to be technically viable. PLA
                                 is a strong biodegradable and recyclable thermoplastic appropriate for use on an organic
                                 farm. Capital costs of an open-source 3-D printer can be saved with the on-farm printing
                                 of a single advanced analytical instrument in a day or replacing of hundreds of inexpensive
                                 products over a year. In order for the full potential of open-source 3-D printing
                                 to be realized to assist organic farm economic resiliency and self-sufficiency, future
                                 work is outlined in five core areas: designs of 3-D printable objects, 3-D printing
                                 materials, 3-D printers, software and 3-D printable repositories.
