                                          <p id="d1e141">Changes in the production of research (more collaborative, more inter- and transdisciplinary,
                                             more oriented towards societal demand) are influencing the ways in which research
                                             is evaluated. Traditional methods of evaluation primarily focussing on the production
                                             of scientific articles have long since given way to more comprehensive methods in
                                             which researchers' other activities are assessed too. Beyond these developments, evaluation
                                             also involves research endeavours concerning collaboration with other stakeholders
                                             in society, such as industry, NGO's, consumer groups, or governmental organisations.

                                          <p id="d1e143">However, this transformation does not happen without difficulties because there is
                                             no broad consensus about how to evaluate research in a more comprehensive way. When
                                             reviewing research in the broader perspective of its merits for societal questions,
                                             there are at least two kind of questions that arise. The first one is whether we should
                                             emulate the kind of indicators used in the evaluation of scientific quality or develop
                                             a different kind of methodological approach, for example a more qualitative one. The
                                             second type of question is whether we will be able to find data that is robust enough
                                             to perform the evaluation in responsible and justifiable ways. Both questions are
                                             important for the policy support necessary to develop reliable and acceptable evaluation
                                             procedures.
                                          </p>
                                          <p id="d1e145">However, perhaps more important is the overarching question of the function of evaluation
                                             itself in the newly emerging context. Is it an instrument primarily used for purposes
                                             of accountability, or is it an instrument for mutual learning and improving the research
                                             effort? Improving in this context does not mean striving for a higher position in
                                             one of the international rankings, but being more effective in reaching the scientific
                                             and societal goals intended. Further, to make this question even more demanding, societal
                                             goals are not undisputed; on the contrary, these goals are often the subject of fierce
                                             debates between, for example, policy makers and NGO's, or industry and consumer organisations.
                                             Agricultural research is therefore an excellent example, because it shows that it
                                             is not a matter of simply finding indicators for applied agricultural research, but
                                             that research in this sector is connected to much broader discussions (and controversies)
                                             in society about how to produce food in a sustainable way.
                                          </p>
                                          <p id="d1e147">It is therefore both timely and necessary that Wolf et al. [<a href="#R1">1</a>] take a closer look at the strategies necessary to change the mindset of those who
                                             are responsible in universities and at other levels of the scientific system for the
                                             development of alternative evaluation systems. To focus on the encouragement of connections
                                             between parts of the research and innovation system that already have a stake in the
                                             transition of science for its own sake to science for society may lead to innovative
                                             new networks in which the broader perspective is taken seriously. The debates referred
                                             to above will be part of such new networks, and of the development of different evaluation
                                             systems. As Wolf et al. show, there are several promising developments in this respect.
                                             Unfortunately, as is also made clear, these are still confronted by incentive systems
                                             that favour the old style of evaluation and the old method of producing research:
                                             mono-disciplinary, with a focus on publication in international journals.
                                          </p>
                                          <p id="d1e152">This means that there is a major problem in building a new evaluation culture that
                                             is more fitting to the new arrangements, in which much scientific research currently
                                             takes place.  A key problem is the continued gap between the advanced understanding
                                             of this changing relationship between science and society—as developed by scholars
                                             of science and technology—and the policy context. Many policy makers and universities'
                                             governing boards still tend to rely heavily on more traditional ranking systems that
                                             are relatively easy to work with and work well in the institution's marketing strategy.
                                             
                                          </p>
                                          <p id="d1e154">Therefore, the possible strategies mentioned by Wolf et al.—valuable as they are—should
                                             be extended to include a strategy to change the basic attitude of decision makers.
                                             They too should understand that a broader approach is both necessary and useful. This
                                             is especially valid for the research efforts addressed in this article, inter- and
                                             transdisciplinary research that is the product of collaboration between different
                                             fields and expertise coming from science and society. If it is indeed the case that
                                             there is joint agenda setting, and co-production, it only makes sense to alter the
                                             evaluation process in a direction that does justice to these new arrangements and
                                             the kind of questions that are relevant in that context.
                                          </p>
                                          <p id="d1e156">To a large extent, this is a question of ownership. In traditional academic research,
                                             there was one main funder, the government. Under such circumstances, evaluation becomes
                                             primarily an instrument for accountability. The main questions then were whether tax
                                             payers' money was spent in a responsible way, and whether the government/researchers
                                             were doing the best they could (were they as good as possible?). However, when other
                                             funders and stakeholders become part of the equation, the prime goal of evaluation
                                             shifts from accountability to communication between partners—regarding goals and research
                                             design—and to mutual learning. In this situation, the ownership of the evaluation
                                             shifts from one principal funder to a joint responsibility shared among the most relevant
                                             stakeholders. Through a joint effort of these stakeholders one might be able to convince
                                             policy makers to allow for broader, more comprehensive methods of evaluation.  It
                                             would help, then, if the availability and accessibility of data was at the best possible
                                             level, i.e. as robust and representative as possible for the activities and interactions
                                             that take place in the network. Among other things, this would mean that peer review
                                             has to be extended to reviews based on broader expertise.
