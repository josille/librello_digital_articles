                     which was established for organic dairy farms in Northern Germany involving different
                     animal health experts who participated in the meetings. Furthermore, the properties
                     of measures that are of decisive importance for implementation on the farms were identified
                     to improve consultancy services for dairy farming. Once a year, the farmers met on
                     a host-farm in one of three groups consisting of five to nine farms, a facilitator
                     and an expert. At each meeting, a host-farm was visited and the analysed data of all
                     participating farms of the previous year were presented to the group members. Each
                     farmer had the possibility to report on success stories and issues concerning his
                     herd. During discussions, the farmers first proposed mutual farm-specific measures
                     for improving herd health and animal welfare. Afterwards, the expert named possible
                     interventions and commented on the given measures of the farmers. All measures were
                     noted by the facilitator. At the end of each meeting, each farmer could choose which
                     of the given measures he wanted to implement. Open group-interviews as well as anonymous
                     questionnaires for the farmers were used at the meetings in winter 2016/2017 to evaluate
                     their perception of this consulting project and to determine which properties of measures
                     were important for implementation on the farms. Based on the results of this study,
                     the participating farmers were very positive towards this kind of consulting project.
                     They favoured the participation of an expert during the meetings and the analysis
                     of farm specific data. Farmers mostly chose measures for implementation proposed by
                     farmers and approved by the expert, followed by those proposed by the expert only.
                     Measures were chosen when they were practical in the implementation, effective, efficient
                     and took a low additional workload for implementation.

            <p id="d1e118">Achieving and maintaining good animal health and welfare is an important aim in organic
               livestock husbandry (Council Regulation (EC) No. 834/2007), requiring continuous development
               as well as management adjustments on organic farms [<a href="#R1">1</a>]. In order to attain a high welfare level, management plays an important role [<a href="#R2">2</a>]. However, managing a farm according to organic principles does not automatically
               guarantee high levels of animal health and welfare. With regard to the great impact
               of farm managers’ behaviour and attitudes on animal health and welfare [<a href="#R2">2</a>], implementing animal health plans was recommended in order to motivate organic farmers
               to continuously and actively improve animal health and welfare on their farms [<a href="#R3">3</a>]. Herd health plans should be based on the assessment and evaluation of current farm
               data and real farm circumstances combined with feedback, planning the implementation
               of farm-specific interventions in a continuous process of development and improvement
               of animal health and welfare [<a href="#R1">1</a>, <a href="#R4">4</a>]. Furthermore, herd health planning should involve external advisers and knowledge,
               be written down, highlight good aspects and success stories as well as address problem
               areas on the farms in order to promote the learning process [<a href="#R5">5</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e142">During recent years, several successful approaches focusing on herd health planning
               for organic production were established in Europe [<a href="#R1">1</a>, <a href="#R6">6</a>, <a href="#R7">7</a>, <a href="#R8">8</a>]. In Denmark, so-called ‘Stable Schools’ were established. The principle of ‘Stable
               Schools’ is the exchange of knowledge between farmers who face similar challenges
               and work for a common aim. These farmers are able to advise mutually on practical
               measures [<a href="#R6">6</a>]. ‘Stable Schools’ have their origin in ‘Farmer Field Schools’ (FFS) which were developed
               for farmers in developing countries. The basic idea of FFS is the exchange of knowledge
               and experience, interactive education and strengthening the farmers’ personalities
               and, especially, common learning in groups of farmers who meet on host-farms without
               the presence of any expert like a veterinarian or adviser [<a href="#R6">6</a>]. Vaarst <i>et al.</i> [<a href="#R6">6</a>] suggested that farmers benefit most when there is a link between the discussed issues
               and the real situation on their farms. If this is the case, farmers develop the necessary
               knowledge by themselves. In ‘Stable Schools’, the farmers are equal and learn from
               each other by giving mutual advice. The only external person who participates in these
               on-farm meetings is a facilitator who guides the process [<a href="#R6">6</a>]. He or she does not offer advice but leads the meeting as well as the discussion.
               Furthermore, the facilitator encourages the host-farmer to be active and the fellow
               farmers to be critical and to feel free to propose measures to solve farm-specific
               problems of the host-farm [<a href="#R6">6</a>, <a href="#R9">9</a>]. Additionally, the facilitator provides and evaluates current farm data to present
               these to participating farmers in ‘Stable Schools’ [<a href="#R10">10</a>]. Within the ANIPLAN-project, ‘Stable Schools’ were adopted in seven European countries,
               including Austria, Denmark, Germany, Norway, Switzerland, the Netherlands and the
               United Kingdom [<a href="#R7">7</a>]. Different ‘Stable Schools’ or herd health plan projects handled different animal
               health and welfare issues such as improving udder health, phasing out antibiotics
               on organic dairy farms through herd health plans [<a href="#R3">3</a>, <a href="#R7">7</a>, <a href="#R11">11</a>, <a href="#R12">12</a>], or lameness reduction in dairy herds [<a href="#R3">3</a>, <a href="#R13">13</a>]. Especially in dairy production, ‘Stable Schools’ have proved to be useful to enhance
               animal health and welfare in recent years [<a href="#R3">3</a>, <a href="#R6">6</a>, <a href="#R8">8</a>, <a href="#R11">11</a>, <a href="#R13">13</a>, <a href="#R14">14</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e223">The attitudes of farmers participating in ‘Stable Schools’ or other herd health plan
               projects were mainly very positive [<a href="#R4">4</a>, <a href="#R6">6</a>, <a href="#R15">15</a>] and the compliance of dairy farmers to implement measures was high [<a href="#R3">3</a>, <a href="#R15">15</a>]. Reasons given for high implementation of interventions included ease of implementation,
               integrability in the farm routine and daily working routine, and the requirement of
               only little capital [<a href="#R3">3</a>]. Good acceptance of ‘Stable Schools’ and herd health plans in general depends on
               the involvement of the farmers in the process [<a href="#R6">6</a>, <a href="#R7">7</a>, <a href="#R9">9</a>, <a href="#R11">11</a>, <a href="#R13">13</a>] as well as the farm-specific goals and measures [<a href="#R6">6</a>, <a href="#R9">9</a>]. Furthermore, an important point for the success of herd health plans is the use
               and evaluation of current farm data [<a href="#R15">15</a>, <a href="#R16">16</a>]. Moreover, the interaction between farmers and external consultant was mentioned
               to be a major reason for the effectiveness of herd health plans [<a href="#R1">1</a>]. External advice in general was identified as an important precondition for a successful
               herd health planning [<a href="#R1">1</a>, <a href="#R12">12</a>]. This is due to the fact that participation of external persons offers a more objective
               view and inspiration and may help to identify issues and to find solutions [<a href="#R1">1</a>, <a href="#R6">6</a>, <a href="#R15">15</a>]. Therefore, not only farmers but also agricultural advisers or veterinarians took
               part in consulting projects. Indeed, a veterinarian who is interested in organic farming
               as well as in herd health is a potential partner for farmers [<a href="#R6">6</a>]. Thus, the ‘erfa’ (abbreviation for ‘erfaring’ which means experience in Danish)
               or ‘Farmer Experience Exchange Groups’ were established in Denmark, consisting of
               farmers who often manage similar farms and a professional expert like, for example,
               a veterinarian who meet up on host-farms. Sometimes even a specialist expert is invited
               to take part in such meetings. This kind of project combines the common learning effect
               with a professional expert but focuses on a special topic than on the farm-specific
               issues [<a href="#R6">6</a>, <a href="#R9">9</a>]. However, according to Bourdieu [<a href="#R17">17</a>], such combinations in general run the risk of an imbalance within the group as the
               professional probably dominates the non-professionals, in this case the farmers. Possible
               reasons are: the professional’s authority, on the one hand, and the common expectations
               regarding his or her knowledge and abilities, which may be perceived to be superior
               to those of the ‘non-professionals’, i.e. farmers, on the other hand. Nevertheless,
               it should not be forgotten that the professional, like for example the veterinarian,
               probably has important knowledge that the farmers might lack and, hence, can benefit
               from [<a href="#R6">6</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e307">The aim of the present study was to investigate the famers’ opinions on a consulting
               project for organic dairy herds in Northern Germany to improve consultancy services
               to organic dairy farming. Specifically, we (1) asked about the role of the expert
               taking part in the meetings; and (2) aimed to identify properties of those suggested
               measures that are chosen for implementation on the participating farms in order to
               make herd health planning more successful in future.

               <p id="d1e315">In July 2011, the University of Applied Sciences and Arts Hannover, Hannover, Germany
                  started a consulting project for farmers of organic dairy farms in Northern Germany
                  in cooperation with the Competence Centre for Organic Farming called “Ökoring e.&nbsp;V.”
                  based in Visselhövede, Lower Saxony, Germany. The aim of this project was to improve
                  the animal health and welfare of organic dairy herds. At the outset, managers of organic
                  dairy farms, who were familiar with the Competence Centre for Organic Farming due
                  to prior consultation meetings, were invited via questionnaire to participate voluntarily
                  in the fee-based consulting project. After issuing the invitations, 17 farmers agreed
                  to take part in this project. Three farmers quitted the project after the consulting
                  meetings in winter 2012 without giving a reason but between 2013 and 2016, nine other
                  organic dairy farm managers joined. Thus, for this analysis, 17 organic dairy farms
                  were consulted in 2011 and 2012, respectively. As two of the 17 farmers participating
                  in the project in winter 2012 could not attend the meetings in winter 2012, only 15
                  farmers took part. In December 2016 and January 2017, the farmers of 23 organic dairy
                  herds participated in the consulting meetings.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e317">All participating farms were located in Northern Germany, predominantly in Lower-Saxony
                  but also in Schleswig-Holstein and Bremen. All participating herds had completed the
                  transformation process from conventional to organic dairy farming by 2011. The herd
                  size was 12-290 cows. All farms ensured their dairy herds access to pasture, at least
                  during the summer months. The participating farmers mainly kept dairy cows of the
                  Holstein Friesian breed but also included other breeds like German black pied cattle,
                  crossbreeds of dairy and beef cattle, Angeln cattle, the Simmental breed and Rotvieh.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e319">At the beginning of the consulting project, the farmers were allocated to one of three
                  groups depending on the annual milk yield per cow, their location and similar economy.
                  In this way, three groups with nearly the same number of participants were formed.
                  Group one included between five (2012) and seven (2016/2017) farms, group two consisted
                  of between five (2012) and nine (2016/2017) farms and farmers from seven farms participated
                  in the meetings of the third group in 2012 and 2016/2017, respectively. Usually, the
                  same farmers always met, although the groups were replenished after individual farms
                  had left.

               <p id="d1e324">In the first eighteen months, each group met three times. Then each group met once
                  a year, mostly in the winter months.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e326">During the consulting years, farm data were gathered from every herd based on the
                  monthly dairy herd improvement test with information on milk yields, fat and protein
                  components, somatic cell counts, cow lifetime, number of lactating cows, lactation
                  number, new infection rates during lactation and dry-period, fertility data etc. on
                  the one hand and on farm-questionnaires on the other hand. In the questionnaires,
                  the farmers documented the frequency of calving, clinical mastitis, lameness, fertility
                  disorders, metabolic diseases and calf diseases as well as the treatments of these
                  diseases.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e328">Ahead of the annual meetings, the farmers were asked over the phone to name animal
                  health issues which had occurred since their last meeting. Depending on the predominant
                  animal health problems of the participating farms per group, which emerged during
                  the phone conversations with the farmers but also derived from the analysed data of
                  the monthly dairy herd improvement test as well as from questionnaires, an expert,
                  like a veterinarian, with specific know-how on for example udder health, claw health,
                  metabolic diseases or fertility was invited to join those meetings. All experts had
                  over ten years’ experience in immediate production-related, agricultural consulting.
                  
               </p>
               <p id="d1e330">The procedure of those regular meetings was mostly identical: first, the members of
                  one group as well as the staff member of the Competence Centre for organic farming
                  (called facilitator) and an expert met on a farm of one participating manager of the
                  group (host farm). The same facilitator was involved in all three groups. Each meeting
                  took place on another farm in turn until all farms in one group had been visited by
                  the group members.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e332">At the beginning of each group meeting, the annual mean of the collected data of all
                  herds in the mutual comparison was presented to all farmers in overview tables so
                  that the farmers could benchmark their herd and animal health data against those of
                  other herds with similar milk yields. Afterwards, the analysed monthly data of the
                  dairy herd improvement tests and of the questionnaires of the last twelve months of
                  all participating herds were shown to all group-members one after another. Due to
                  the comparisons of the annual means of analysed data of the present year with the
                  data of the past years for each herd, it could be checked whether or not the presumptions
                  of the farmers regarding animal health problems during the last twelve months were
                  reasonable. Such presumptions, collected during phone calls, were, for example, high
                  somatic bulk milk cell counts, a high rate of new intramammary infections during the
                  dry-period, stillbirths or lameness.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e334">After presenting the data of one farm, the farmer was given the opportunity to report
                  a success story of his farm by telling the group which aspect of herd health had improved
                  and the possible reasons for this. Then the farmers jointly discussed the current
                  animal health problems on that particular farm and put forward recommendations to
                  improve these issues. In addition, the farmers were encouraged to ask each other questions
                  and the experts attending the event. The facilitator led the discussions. Afterwards,
                  the expert was given the opportunity to comment on the data, the farm-specific animal
                  health problems and gave advice to solve these issues. The suggested measures were
                  assorted to one of three groups depending on their source to assess the impact of
                  different sources on the farmers’ choices which measures to implement on their farms.
                  Those measures given by farmers as well as those of the expert and those suggested
                  by the farmers first and then confirmed by the expert, were noted for each farm by
                  the facilitator.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e336">Afterwards, the farmers could decide for themselves which and whose suggestions they
                  wanted to put into practice, naming reasons for this so that management plans were
                  compiled. Again, the chosen measures were noted down by the facilitator. The farmers
                  took home a copy of the chosen farm-specific measures written down by the facilitator
                  during the meeting so that they could see in detail which measures they had chosen
                  for implementation. This procedure was repeated for every farm. After presenting the
                  data, the farm-specific presentation with analysed herd data was sent to each farmer
                  by e-mail.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e338">At the end of the meetings, the participants inspected the host farm on a comprehensive
                  guided tour led by the host farmer. If necessary, the given farming conditions could
                  be better assessed by all farmers and the experts and further improvement measures
                  could be discussed.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e340">The consulting meetings in 2012 and 2016/2017 were chosen for data evaluation because
                  farmers who had started the project in 2011 were familiar with their group members
                  in winter 2012 on the one hand and had got to know the procedure of the meetings until
                  then on the other hand. Moreover, there was enough time - also for fellow farmers
                  who joined the project later- to get familiar with the group members and to deepen
                  their knowledge of special health topics during this period (between 2012 and 2016/2017).
                  The evaluation years 2012 and 2016/2017 were especially important as udder health
                  issues were discussed intensively in the annual consulting meetings so that there
                  might have been a knowledge gain and learning effect of the farmers.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e342">During the meetings in December 2016 and January 2017, an anonymous questionnaire
                  was distributed to each participating farmer. Farmers were prompted to answer the
                  following five multiple-choice questions: “How important is the experience/knowledge
                  exchange with fellow farmers/an expert?” (question no. 1), “Did you feel intimidated
                  or were you reluctant when an expert took part at the annual meeting?” (question no.
                  2), “Do you stay in contact with the fellow farmers of your consulting group apart
                  from the annual meeting and if yes, how often?” (question no. 3), “How important is
                  the farm visit of the group fellow farmers for you?”(question no. 4) and “Do you find
                  the visit of the fellow farmers’ farms educational or useful?” (question no. 5). Moreover,
                  the farmers had to assess the importance of properties for the measures to be chosen
                  for implementation on their farms (no. 6). Therefore, they had to rank at least six
                  predetermined properties (‘additional daily workload for implementation’, ‘additional
                  workload until the measure can be implemented (e.g. planning, reconstruction, installation)’,
                  ‘duration from the implementation of the measure to the detection of effectiveness’,
                  ‘effectiveness and efficacy (business-related)’ as well as ‘extent of structural and
                  technical changes on the farm’ and ‘workable and practical implementation in everyday
                  life’) and optionally name and rank more factors in descending order of importance
                  (from 1 = most important to 6 = least important). After analysing all anonymous questionnaires,
                  the property with the lowest total was stated to be the factor most important for
                  choosing the measure to be implemented on a farm.

            <p id="d1e359">The majority of the participating farmers found the exchange of experience and knowledge
               with both fellow farmers and experts “very important” (Table <a href="#Tab1">1</a>). None of the farmers felt intimidated when an expert took part at the annual meeting
               (Table 1). Furthermore, the majority of farmers had contact with group fellow farmers
               between 1 to 2 times a year (Table <a href="#Tab1">1</a>). Most farmers found the farm-visits of group fellow farmers “important” and “absolutely”
               educational or useful (Table <a href="#Tab1">1</a>). The evaluation of no. 6 of the questionnaire indicated that a workable and practical
               implementation in everyday life, effectiveness and efficacy of measures as well as
               the additional daily workload for implementation were the most important properties
               of measures for implementation (Table <a href="#Tab2">2</a>). The properties of measures are listed in descending order of priority in Table
               <a href="#Tab2">2</a>, from properties of measures with the most importance (no.1) to properties of measures
               with the least importance to get chosen by farmers for implementation. In addition
               to Table <a href="#Tab2">2</a>, two farmers gave explicit definitions for the option “others”. The farmers mentioned
               easy physical performing of the measure and successful implementation thereof as being
               the second most important criterion.

            <p id="d1e690">Within the context of the open feedback rounds at the end of each group meeting, farmers
               mentioned that they really liked the very informative exchange of knowledge and experience
               with open-minded fellow famers and the expert. Openly discussing as a group proposed
               measures to solve their individual farm-related problems and those of the other farmers
               was very important, educational and highly motivating and offered an opportunity for
               exchanging information about topics which not every group member was familiar with.
               Furthermore, they appreciated the participation of an expert in each meeting. Receiving
               the expert’s approval of their proposed measures made them feel more confident. The
               critical mindset of the group members, including the experts, put “positive pressure”
               on the farmers, as they commented. They were also grateful for the detailed data evaluated
               during the year and for the annual summary report. They especially highlighted the
               data selection, the detailed presentation and the kind of approach to and the distribution
               of the data which they began to understand more and more. Especially the presentation
               of the development over several years and over the previous twelve months was important
               to detect tendencies of herd health parameters. Effects of measures which had been
               implemented during the previous year were presented simply and clearly for the farmers
               to follow. In addition, the participating farmers welcomed the direct reciprocal comparison
               of all herds of the group members at the beginning of each meeting. The mutual comparison
               was motivating for the farmers to improve herd health and animal welfare and to achieve
               their individual aims. To name problems of the previous year regarding herd health
               prior to the annual meetings was effective as farmers had to consider them, go through
               last year’s performance again and give an honest assessment to the facilitator. Moreover,
               they welcomed that the farmers themselves should specify which suggested measures
               he or she wanted to implement on their farm and to name reasons for that. Taking these
               decisions home in a written form served the purpose of a reminder which also helped
               the farmers to remain motivated in their daily work.

                  and continuous tool for herd management in recent years [<a href="#R3">3</a>]. One way of establishing this opportunity to improve herd health and welfare is
                  to form small groups of farmers working together to exchange experience and knowledge
                  and to provide a common learning platform [<a href="#R6">6</a>].

                  the group were defined: mutual trust and respect of the participants, an open-minded
                  attitude and openness to the whole group to receive comments and constructive criticism
                  as well as suggestions for potential improvement and a high level of motivation of
                  all group members [<a href="#R6">6</a>, <a href="#R10">10</a>]. Furthermore, having equal rights to report about experiences, conducting honest
                  dialogues and being able to contribute are important prerequisites of the participants
                  to make the herd health planning in groups successful [<a href="#R6">6</a>]. These characteristics of the discussion-groups were appreciated by the farmers

                  animal health and welfare planning [<a href="#R1">1</a>, <a href="#R6">6</a>, <a href="#R9">9</a>, <a href="#R12">12</a>, <a href="#R15">15</a>], which is in accordance with the opinion of the participating farmers in the present
                  study. The interaction between the farmer and an external person like, for example,
                  a colleague, a veterinarian or an adviser was found to be a fundamental element of
                  successful herd health planning. Therefore, external persons should be involved as
                  advisers in improving animal health or welfare [<a href="#R12">12</a>]. As external persons often see things differently than someone who works in the
                  same environment every day [<a href="#R6">6</a>, <a href="#R15">15</a>], their participation can be beneficial to identify problem areas as well as to provide
                  solutions or inspiration by exchanging observations and sharing reflections on the
                  on-farm situations [<a href="#R12">12</a>]. Meeting and discussing with external persons was the main motivation to join ‘Stable
                  Schools’ for some farmers [<a href="#R4">4</a>, <a href="#R14">14</a>] as ‘discussing with the farmers is what gives the most’ [<a href="#R4">4</a>]. New input and discussing farming methods help farmers realise why they work the
                  way they do and provide a great opportunity for them to learn from more experienced
                  farmers [<a href="#R4">4</a>].

               <p id="d1e1099">Different approaches of farmer groups are common in animal production in many countries
                  [<a href="#R4">4</a>, <a href="#R6">6</a>]. Visiting farms of fellow farmers was appreciated, just like in the present study
                  because farmers liked the opportunity to have a look around on other farms and to
                  compare the animals there with their own [<a href="#R4">4</a>]. Additionally, they enjoyed sharing knowledge and ideas from other farms which could
                  be implemented on their own farms [<a href="#R4">4</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1113">The facilitator taking part in the present study had the same role as in previous
                  surveys of ‘Stable Schools’ [<a href="#R4">4</a>, <a href="#R6">6</a>]. He did, for example, not take part as an expert, but guided the decision-making
                  process and directed the discussion [<a href="#R4">4</a>, <a href="#R6">6</a>, <a href="#R9">9</a>, <a href="#R10">10</a>]. Moreover, the facilitator encouraged the farmers to take an active part in the
                  meetings being curious, critical and taking on an advisory role, just like it was
                  in another herd health planning project [<a href="#R6">6</a>]. Another important task of the facilitator, not only in the present study, was to
                  prepare the agenda of the meetings and to write down the measures chosen for implementation
                  for each farmer [<a href="#R4">4</a>, <a href="#R6">6</a>]. This written plan containing clear and concise points of the discussion [<a href="#R9">9</a>] was most welcomed and was perceived as being very important, not only by the participating
                  farmers of the present study [<a href="#R4">4</a>]. As a written plan confronts the farmers with the aims and measures they have wanted
                  to implement since the last meeting, it helps them to be active in achieving their
                  aims [<a href="#R4">4</a>, <a href="#R9">9</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1156">As the present project included only organic dairy farmers, the advantage of the facilitator
                  being also a staff member of the Competence Centre for Organic Farming was that he
                  could answer upcoming specific questions regarding organic principles and the Council
                  Regulation (EC) No. 834/2007 during the discussion. By integrating not only a facilitator
                  but also an expert into each consulting-group because, according to Vaarst <i>et al.</i> [<a href="#R10">10</a>], discussions with experts can be of great benefit for all participants of discussion
                  groups, the present project combined characteristics of ‘erfa-groups’ and ‘Stable
                  Schools’ but without ensuring complete equality among participants as in ‘Stable Schools’
                  [<a href="#R4">4</a>, <a href="#R6">6</a>].
                  
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1170">The combinations of farmers and experts like veterinarians, may increase the risk
                  of a disparity in a group or lead to a permanent asymmetric power relationship as
                  the experts might dominate the ‘non-professionals’, in this case the farmers [<a href="#R6">6</a>, <a href="#R17">17</a>]. Furthermore, this symbolic imbalance may affect the cooperation between farmers
                  and veterinarians as well as the communication between these participating groups
                  [<a href="#R6">6</a>]. <i>Vaarst and Roderick</i> [<a href="#R18">18</a>] suggested that farmers might be less open-minded and share their knowledge and experience
                  less freely when an expert attends the meetings as they think the expert is the person
                  who gives the right answers as well. These fears could not be confirmed in the present
                  study. On the contrary, the farmers participating in the present study mentioned that
                  they appreciated the participation of an expert and felt more confident and reassured
                  after the measures proposed by them had been approved by the expert. They also mentioned
                  that the critical way of thinking of both, the fellow farmers as well as the expert,
                  exerted some kind of positive pressure on these farmers. In any case, a respectful
                  communication of the farmers with each other as well as between farmers and professionals
                  is paramount [<a href="#R1">1</a>]. However, by integrating a facilitator or an expert, there is, of course, some risk
                  of disrupting the dynamics of a discussion within a group of farmers. To avoid interrupting
                  the group dynamics during the discussion, the facilitator or expert should speak at
                  the very end of it [<a href="#R9">9</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1194">Moreover, Vaarst <i>et al.</i> [<a href="#R6">6</a>] considered that, assuming that the farmers trust the expert and that the advice
                  given by the latter is of interest for the farm, farmers might rather follow the expert’s
                  advice. This assumption was confirmed by the results of the present study: if the
                  farmers had the choice, they rather chose measures to put into practice proposed by
                  the expert only or by the farmers as well as by the expert than measures proposed
                  only by their fellow farmers. A possible reason for that might be that the farmers
                  had more trust in the measures proposed by the expert regarding correctness, usefulness
                  and effectiveness than in the measures proposed by their fellow farmers. Since the
                  expert also commented on measures proposed by farmers which he considered to be incorrect,
                  unnecessary or useless and gave reasons for this, these meetings had a learning effect
                  for farmers as well. This learning effect was shown by the significantly higher number
                  of proposed measures given by the farmers first and later assessed by the expert in
                  2016/2017 compared to the number in 2012 in the present study. This fact emphasises
                  the importance of an expert participating in the annual consulting meetings, although
                  a significant learning effect in ‘Stable Schools’ is also mentioned [<a href="#R6">6</a>]. Other reasons for this significant difference might be that the farmers in a consulting-group
                  became familiar with each other’s way of behaving over time so that they probably
                  could better assess how the other farmers would react after being given advice to
                  improve herd health. Hence, the communication in consulting-groups might have become
                  more open and the farmers were able to understand farm-specific problems of other
                  farms after some time.

               <p id="d1e1208">Herd health plans should be based on the knowledge of the current health and welfare
                  status of a herd based on farm data to promote farm-specific planning [<a href="#R12">12</a>, <a href="#R15">15</a>, <a href="#R16">16</a>]. Bell <i>et al.</i> [<a href="#R16">16</a>], who gathered data using questionnaires, also stated that using and reviewing current
                  farm data was necessary to make herd health planning effective. The farmers in the
                  present study emphasised the importance of data selection as well as their detailed
                  presentation as also other farmers had done in the past [<a href="#R15">15</a>]. Previous surveys [<a href="#R1">1</a>, <a href="#R9">9</a>] also described the relevance of presenting data which are understandable and available
                  to the farmer. The advantage of an expert taking part in the consulting meetings is
                  that the farmers learn to understand the meaning and correlations of presented parameters
                  through explanations by the expert.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1235">In addition, the participating farmers referred positively to the presentation of
                  their farm data not only in comparison with the individual farm data of recent years
                  but also in contrast to data of other farms in the group. This kind of benchmarking
                  was motivating, this point also being mentioned by the participating farmers of the
                  present survey during the open feedback rounds [<a href="#R12">12</a>]. Furthermore, this kind of benchmarking is effective for achieving an aim and can
                  also be encouraging for the discussion and improve the farm-situation [<a href="#R7">7</a>, <a href="#R10">10</a>]. Moreover, presenting data of the last years and the last twelve months can help
                  the farmers to detect tendencies of herd health parameters even if this development
                  of parameters has not been noticed by them in their herds so far. The early detection
                  of negative developments of certain herd health parameters can help to react specifically
                  by implementing measures. In the present study, the realistic assessment of farm-specific
                  data, especially with regard to the whole on-farm situation, was important to develop
                  the right farm-specific goals.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1246">The challenge to name problem areas of the current year made the participating farmers
                  reflect on what had happened in their herds during that year, which is in accordance
                  with previous surveys [<a href="#R4">4</a>, <a href="#R6">6</a>]. Moreover, the presentation of the farms’ individual and current data in comparison
                  to the data of the years before clarified whether or not the “gut instinct” of the
                  farmers regarding the problem issues of the current year was right. On the other hand,
                  we discovered that telling others a success story concerning one’s own herd was motivating
                  for all participants. Therefore, these success stories seem to be important elements
                  when farmers share their experience(s) with their fellow farmers. This is confirmed
                  by other surveys, too [<a href="#R1">1</a>, <a href="#R6">6</a>].

               <p id="d1e1263">Another crucial element to make herd-health planning successful is the farmers’ involvement
                  in the consulting process [<a href="#R6">6</a>, <a href="#R7">7</a>, <a href="#R11">11</a>, <a href="#R12">12</a>]. Several surveys came to the conclusion that farmers have to be actively involved
                  in identifying their problems, their individual aims and choosing the measures to
                  take. Furthermore, farmers should summarise why they chose certain measures to implement
                  changes and improvements of animal welfare on their farms [<a href="#R6">6</a>, <a href="#R9">9</a>, <a href="#R11">11</a>, <a href="#R12">12</a>]. This active involvement of the farmers was highlighted by the farmers in the present
                  study as well. It is important that the farmers’ perceptions of the current problems
                  of their herds guide the process during a meeting, even if external persons like fellow
                  farmers, advisers or veterinarians have different, probably even conflicting opinions
                  [<a href="#R1">1</a>]. In the present study, the percentage of measures which were chosen to be implemented
                  by the farmers at the annual meetings in 2012 as well as in in 2016/2017 was lower
                  compared to results of surveys where farmers implemented between 57% and partly <span class="inline-formula">

                     </span>75% in Austria and Germany, and between less than one-third and up to more than two-thirds
                  of the given measures in England and Wales (although that surveys stated the percentage
                  of already implemented measures) [<a href="#R3">3</a>, <a href="#R8">8</a>, <a href="#R15">15</a>]. Nevertheless, it should be taken into consideration that the compliance probably
                  depends on the scale of implementing a certain measure. The measures vary, for example,
                  regarding the amount of time required or costs. Liming the lying areas of the cows
                  one more time per week would probably more likely be implemented by farmers than cleaning
                  the cows’ lying areas twice a day instead of once only. Tube feeding every newborn
                  calf shortly after birth with colostrum implies also doing this at night, which probably
                  will receive less acceptance among farmers. Analysing milk samples of each cow at
                  drying-off and inserting teat sealants for every cow at drying off causes more direct
                  costs, which probably leads to less acceptance as well.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1310">To promote the eager implementation of measures, farmers have to be convinced of changing
                  their management practice regarding different diseases. The best way of convincing
                  farmers is to describe and consequently understand the implications of diseases for
                  animal welfare on the one hand and for the economy on the other. Furthermore, as mentioned
                  above, benchmarking can help to realise the suboptimal situation on a farm [<a href="#R15">15</a>]. Action can only take place when a problem is detected. If a problem is perceived
                  as less important or even not serious enough by the farmer, the information about
                  it is not meaningful to him and therefore will not affect him [<a href="#R19">19</a>, <a href="#R20">20</a>]. Additionally, as motivation is crucial for the willingness to implement measures
                  to improve herd health [<a href="#R8">8</a>], a lack of motivation of the farmer may not lead to a successful implementation
                  of the proposed measures [<a href="#R1">1</a>]. However, apart from the assessment of the problem as being unimportant, the motivation
                  of farmers depends on many internal as well as external factors. Internal factors
                  are, for example, the management style (e.g. clean and accurate or dirty and quick)
                  consisting of motivation, objectives and influences of specific factors relating to
                  the production environment, for example, milk prices, attitude of the farmer to new
                  techniques, investments or future goals, and personality (age, level of education,
                  experience, ensured succession) [<a href="#R21">21</a>]. Valeeva <i>et al.</i> [<a href="#R22">22</a>], for example, found out that mainly factors which were internal to the farm performance
                  and to the farmer like pleasure of healthy animals and ones’ own reputation provided
                  more motivation to improve mastitis management than external factors like, for example,
                  esteem and performance of the dairy sector in general. Although the motivation for
                  improving herd health differs among individuals [<a href="#R22">22</a>], a lack of motivation seemed to be unlikely to explain the low rate of chosen measures
                  of farmers in the present study because the participation in the consulting project
                  was voluntary. Therefore, it can be assumed that farmers participating in this project
                  wanted to improve animal health and welfare. Moreover, the results of Valeeva <i>et al.</i> [<a href="#R22">22</a>] indicate that farmers are not solely motivated by money to improve their mastitis
                  management. In contrast to the latter point, the analysis of the anonymous questionnaires
                  in the present study showed that efficiency (business-related) is a very important
                  factor for participating farmers when choosing a measure to implement on their farms.
                  Probably this aspect is one reason for a relatively low number of measures in total
                  chosen for implementation in the present study. In addition, practical constraints
                  as well as limitations are seen as reasons for not implementing measures on farms
                  in general [<a href="#R4">4</a>]. Moreover, farmers are often influenced by legislation [<a href="#R4">4</a>, <a href="#R23">23</a>], common law and many institutions [<a href="#R23">23</a>] which might also have played a role in the present study, especially in organic
                  farming. This may affect the farmer’s decision whether to choose and put proposed
                  measures into practice or not.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1359">Furthermore, the analysis of the anonymous questionnaires in the present study showed
                  that a practicable implementation as well as the effectiveness were very important
                  characteristics of those measures which were adopted on farms. This is totally consistent
                  with the results of other surveys [<a href="#R19">19</a>, <a href="#R24">24</a>]. In contrast to Jansen <i>et al.</i> [<a href="#R19">19</a>], in the present study (Table <span class="inline-formula">

                     </mml:math>
                     </span>) and in a survey by Brinkmann [<a href="#R15">15</a>], a short-term effect did not seem to be very important to farmers when choosing
                  the measures they implemented on their farms. While the participants of another intervention-project
                  more frequently implemented management measures, which resulted in changes in their
                  daily work routines, and which also required small capital investments [<a href="#R3">3</a>], Brinkmann [<a href="#R15">15</a>] discovered the reverse: measures, which had to be integrated into the daily or weekly
                  work-routine were less frequently implemented than technical solutions, which were
                  implemented relatively fast. A possible reason for the former case is the necessary
                  persistent discipline which is required during the daily routine [<a href="#R15">15</a>]. Additionally, Brinkmann [<a href="#R15">15</a>] stated that costs incurred by implementation of measures are not determinant whether
                  to choose to implement a measure or not. Farmers in the present study, however, accepted
                  management changes, especially in their daily work-routine, at least if the additional
                  workload was low. The results of this study show that as long as implementing measures
                  is successful and efficient (business-related), workable and less time consuming,
                  farmers accept complex planning, structural or technical changes on their farm and
                  a long period of time between implementing the measures and visible effects on herd
                  health.

            <p id="d1e1399">Based on the feedback of participating farmers, the concept of a consulting project
               including a special expert at each meeting seems to be very well accepted. In contrast
               to fears voiced by other authors, the participating farmers did not feel intimidated
               by the presence of an expert during the meetings. On the contrary, participating farmers
               positively highlighted the participation of different experts at each meeting, as
               the exchange of knowledge and experience with them were very important to most farmers.
               Moreover, they felt proven right after an expert had approved the measures they had
               proposed, making his contribution seem very important. In addition, the experts helped
               the farmers to understand the meaning and correlations of presented parameters through
               explanations during the annual consulting meetings. Furthermore, if farmers had the
               choice, they preferred to implement measures which had been proposed by their fellow
               farmers and later approved by the expert or those which had been proposed by the expert
               exclusively. To be chosen as measures, these measures should definitely be practical,
               effective and efficient (business-related) to implement and their implementation should
               only involve little additional daily workload.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e1401">Further analyses will be necessary to determine whether combining research and practice
               by bringing in experts on various topics to the existing group of farmers and the
               facilitator to combine research and practice was successful regarding the improvement
               of herd health parameters.
