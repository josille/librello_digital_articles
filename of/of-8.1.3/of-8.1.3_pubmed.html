                     in organic and conventional (chemical) agriculture systems.&nbsp;&nbsp; This study present results
                     of on-farm trials conducted on leafy vegetables grown in in organic and conventional
                     management systems. Four leafy vegetables collard green (Brassica oleracea cv. acephala),
                     kale (Brassica oleracea cv. sabellica), lettuce (Lactuca sativa) and swiss chard (Beta
                     vulgaris L. cv. cicla) were grown in organic and conventionally managed plots in the
                     spring 2018 and 2020. United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), National Organic
                     Program (NOP) standards were followed for cultural and management practices in organically
                     managed experimental field plots. Synthetic chemical inputs (seeds and fertilizer)
                     were applied in the experimental field plots managed in conventional production system.
                     Data on plant height, leaf number and total fresh weight of leafy vegetables were
                     measured at the end of the experiment. Results showed that maximum fresh weight per
                     plant was obtained from conventionally grown kale and the lowest was recorded in conventionally
                     grown lettuce. The fresh weight of collard (344.1 g/plant) and kale (475.6 g/plant)
                     was significantly higher in conventional system relative to the organic management
                     system in collar (184.9 g/plant) and kale (242.3 g/plant). In contrast, for lettuce,
                     significantly greater fresh weight was obtained in the organic (266.5 g/plant) compared
                     to conventional (189.3 g/plant). No difference recorded in fresh weight of swiss chard
                     grown in organic (222.0 g/plant) and conventional (263.7 g/plant) production systems.
                     No difference observed in plant height and number of leaf count between the two production
                     systems. Findings suggest that growth and yield responses in organic and conventional
                     production systems can vary with the individual crop species. Results presented could
                     be helpful to growers in planning for the organic production of leafy greens vegetables.

            <p id="d1e82">Scientific reports suggest that organic agriculture is less or higher productive than
               a conventional system that heavily relies on the use of synthetic chemicals. However,
               knowledge on how yields are in organic versus conventional systems is not vastly available
               in many crops, and growers’ interest to know responses on relative yields in crops
               grown in organic and conventional management systems [<a href="#R1">1</a>, <a href="#R2">2</a>, <a href="#R3">3</a>]. The majority of the earlier studies as well as meta-analyses have confirmed organic
               yield lower than the conventional. For instance, meta-analyses have shown that organic
               production system produce 19-25% lower crop yield than conventional [<a href="#R4">4</a>, <a href="#R5">5</a>, <a href="#R6">6</a>]. Likewise, based on the data collected from 10,000 organic farmers representing
               800,000 ha land, the study in the United States (US), found that organic system can
               produce about 80% of the conventional system [<a href="#R7">7</a>]. Although yield is lower, it is possible that the yield gap can be compensated by
               the higher price of organic foods, and the cost involved in maintaining a healthy
               environment and good human health. These yield gaps can also be reduced by implementing
               effective agronomic practices, nutrient management and pest control strategies, and
               thus would create a more sustainable system [<a href="#R8">8</a>, <a href="#R9">9</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e112">Collard (<i>Brassica oleracea</i> cv. acephala), kale (<i>Brassica oleracea</i> cv. sabellica), lettuce (<i>Lactuca sativa</i>) and swiss chard (<i>Beta vulgaris</i> L. cv. cicla) are some of the most commonly grown and consumed leafy greens in the
               US. In the US, lettuce is grown in 15,590 hectares of certified organic land [<a href="#R10">10</a>], while area and production for other leafy green vegetables such as kale, collard
               and swiss chard are not included in the United States Department of Agriculture census
               report. The higher demand for leafy greens is due to their positive association with
               trace minerals, omega fatty acids, antioxidants and vitamins A, C, K, and E, among
               others [<a href="#R11">11</a>, <a href="#R12">12</a>]. Since leafy greens are mostly consumed uncooked, consumers may like to purchase
               organic products if they are sufficiently produced and available locally. The information
               of how much yield one can produce from the organic production system compared to conventional
               systems would be helpful to the grower in making the decision to start organic production
               of leafy greens. As such, extensive comparative studies are needed. Therefore, we
               aim to evaluate the growth and yield responses of different leafy green vegetables
               grown in organic and conventional management systems.

                  (Harvest organics, OMRI Listed). Seedlings were manually irrigated on alternative
                  days to maintain the soil moisture.

               <p id="d1e207">Four leafy green vegetables were arranged in a completely randomized design in organic
                  and conventional systems both in 2018 and 2020 and replicated three times. Therefore,
                  treatments included crop (collard, kale, lettuce and swiss chard), production system
                  (organic and conventional) and the year (2018 and 2020). Both organic and conventional
                  fields were cultivated on 2 April (trial 2018) and 5 March (trial 2020) using a rotary
                  tiller machine (John Deere, Franklin, TN, USA). Black plastic mulch (Hummert’s International,
                  MO, USA) of 0.5 mm thickness was laid using a mulch layer tractor attachment on 8
                  April (trial 2018) and on 6 March (Trial 2020) along with drip tape for irrigation
                  (Berry Hill Irrigation Inc., VA, USA). After laying the mulch, small holes were manually
                  made for each plant at 1 feet distance. Each plot was 55 feet long by 5 feet wide
                  and each plot was divided into four subplots along the length, one for each of the
                  four vegetable crops. Ten plants of each crop were planted in each subplot of 10 feet
                  long. Leafy greens were transplanted manually on 10 April (trial 2018) and on 10 March
                  (trial 2020) into subplots. Plants were fertilized immediately after transplanting
                  in conventional and during transplanting (mixed in the soil) in organic management
                  system. The calculated amount of fertilizer was applied directly around the individual
                  plant. The rate of the compost and chemical fertilizer was calculated and applied
                  based on required nutrients to leafy greens, nutrient composition of compost and soil
                  test report. Tested plants were applied with NPK fertilizer of 5 g/plant and compost
                  100 g/plant. The composition of compost applied in the organic system was 0.46% total
                  nitrogen, 46.8% moisture, 7.93 pH, 1580 mg/kg total phosphorus and 4290 mg/kg total
                  potassium. Chemical fertilizer has Nitrogen (N) Phosphorus(P) and Potassium (K) of
                  8:2:12, respectively. Plants were irrigated on alternative days for 15 minutes using
                  a drip irrigation system. Weeding was done manually and mechanically. No pesticides
                  were applied in organic and conventional trials. At the commercial stage of maturity,
                  vegetables in each plot were harvested from both organic and conventional on 21 May
                  (trial 2018) and on 5 May (trial 2020). Plant height (inch) was measured for all plants,
                  leaf count of kale, collard and swiss chard was counted and fresh weight of plants
                  (g/plant) was measured.

                  g) and the lowest fresh weight was recorded for conventionally grown lettuce (189.30
                  g) (Figure <a href="#Fig1">1</a>). In organic production, lettuce fresh weight was significantly higher compared to
                  collard but similar to other crops, while in conventional production, fresh weight
                  of kale was significantly higher followed by collard, swiss chard and lettuce. Swiss
                  chard and lettuce had similar production in the conventional system. So, in organic
                  farming the crop with the highest market price is the best choice for growers. The
                  fresh weight of kale and collard was significantly higher in the conventional production
                  system, of 475.57 g and 344.08 g, respectively compared to fresh weight obtained for
                  them from the organic system. Lettuce grown in an organic system produced significantly
                  higher fresh weight (266.47 g) than the conventional (189.30 g). Moreover, there was
                  no significant difference in the fresh weight between organic (221.98 g) and conventional
                  (263.75 g) production systems for swiss chard. The maximum fresh weight was obtained
                  in the year 2020 compared to 2018.

            <p id="d1e1039">Fresh weight of collard and kale was significantly higher in a conventionally managed
               field than the organic. Lettuce fresh weight was higher in the organic management
               field while there was no difference in fresh weight of swiss chard between organic
               and conventionally managed fields. Moreover, we received a significantly higher yield
               in the year 2020 than the year 2018. There were no differences in plant height and
               leaf number between two production systems. Leaf size than the leaf number and plant
               height was the contributing factor for higher fresh weight in the current study anticipated.
               Higher yield in current report in agreement with earlier reviews and meta-analyses
               in general that have confirmed lower crop yield in the organic management system [<a href="#R4">4</a>, <a href="#R5">5</a>, <a href="#R6">6</a>]. The yield difference might range from 5% (rain-fed legumes and perennials on weak
               acidic to weak-alkaline soils) to 34% lower yields (when the conventional and organic
               systems are most comparable) in the organic system [<a href="#R4">4</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e1053">Since the conventional production system relies on the use of synthetic fertilizers
               and pesticides, plants can immediately uptake nutrients from chemical fertilizers
               and pest control is much easier with the use of pesticides. As a result, plants can
               grow faster, and thus can result in a higher crop yield. This supports higher fresh
               weight of kale and collard in conventional than organic production in this study.
               In contrast, in organic system, nutrient management and pest control are the major
               challenges [<a href="#R7">7</a>]. Since organic manures are the major source of plant nutrients in the organic management
               system, nutrients released from manures may not meet the nutrient requirement during
               the high-demanding stage of crop growth [<a href="#R13">13</a>]. Moreover, manures added in organic production need to be mineralized from organic
               to inorganic forms of nitrogen before they are available to plants. The microbial
               decomposition and mineralization of soil organic matter is a slow process and also
               dependent on optimum soil temperature and moisture [<a href="#R14">14</a>, <a href="#R15">15</a>]. As the growing period of leafy greens is rather short, nutrients from compost might
               not be ready to be used by plants in that short time period and low N availability
               from compost was made evident for lower yield [<a href="#R16">16</a>, <a href="#R17">17</a>, <a href="#R18">18</a>]. As pesticides are restricted for use in organic production, higher yield gaps may
               also be associated with the crop losses in the organic management system caused by
               diseases, insects and weeds [<a href="#R4">4</a>, <a href="#R8">8</a>, <a href="#R18">18</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e1086">In contrast to the general trend, lettuce yield was significantly higher in the organic
               management system than the conventional and there was no difference in yield between
               organic and conventional production of swiss chard. Although the exact mechanism behind
               this response is lacking, it is possible that the nutrients released from compost
               are enough to gain the full potential yield of lettuce and swiss chard. A 10-year
               field experiment reported that crop yield response was very low in the beginning of
               compost application and yield increased slightly with the duration of the experiment
               [<a href="#R19">19</a>]. Furthermore, we speculate that the nutrient demand for kale and collard is higher
               as they are heavy nutrient feeders and require large amounts of fertilizers whereas
               lettuce and swiss chard are medium to light feeder and thus the required nutrients
               might have been acquired from compost [<a href="#R20">20</a>, <a href="#R21">21</a>]. The nutrient availability of organic fertilizer is less initially, which limits
               the early growth of leafy vegetables, but if leaf picking time is extended, the growth
               and yield can be similar or higher than conventional system [<a href="#R22">22</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e1100">Organic system can nearly match conventional yields under certain conditions, that
               is, with good management practices, particular crop types and growing conditions.
               If compost is analyzed prior to use and provided with approximately the same amount
               of essential nutrients from compost as from inorganic fertilizers, the yield gap can
               be lower [<a href="#R23">23</a>]. As such, growers can compensate for the little yield gap from cheaper inputs, higher
               and more stable prices and risk diversification [<a href="#R24">24</a>]. Organic farmers rely on animal manures and compost and practice crop rotation,
               adjust the timing of planting and harvesting, the use of cover crops and natural pest
               control can reduce the risk in the longer term [<a href="#R25">25</a>]. Alternatively, organic liquid fertilizers that have been developed by different
               manufacturers can be incorporated as an important nutrient source for short-duration
               crops like leafy greens. The homogeneity and the even distribution can be achieved
               when liquid fertilizers are applied to the soil and are easier to transport, handle
               and apply compared to solid fertilizers [<a href="#R26">26</a>]. Some liquid fertilizers are evaluated during the growing season which are top-dressed
               and reported increased organic matter content, microorganism populations in the soil
               and stable soil pH [<a href="#R27">27</a>]. Liquid fertilizer is a prerequisite to ensure optimal nutrient supply for growing
               crops and on the other hand to avoid environmental problems caused by over fertilization
               [<a href="#R28">28</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e1121">We observed a higher crop yield in 2020 than in 2018. We transplanted seedlings of
               leafy greens into the main field one month earlier in the year 2020 than the year
               2018. Plant growth was better when planted one month earlier in 2020 likely due to
               the suitable temperature and lower pest attack. When crops were transplanted in April
               2018, the temperature during the active crop growing period was higher than the optimum
               temperature requirement, thus the condition resulted in poor crop growth. Plants stressed
               with temperature and probably with soil moisture are at great risk of pest attack.
               These might be the reasons for higher crop yield in 2020 compared to 2018.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e1123">Nutrients and pest management are challenging in the organic system and also the difficulties
               in getting sufficient organic certified seeds, fertilizers and compost in bulk amount.
               Government incentive programs on organic agriculture farming and certification would
               help to increase area and production. Although organic agriculture is considered an
               environmentally friendly and sustainable alternative, there is also an argument that
               it would increase greenhouse gas emissions from the related land use changes [<a href="#R29">29</a>, <a href="#R30">30</a>]. This is especially because organic agriculture requires higher land to get the
               same amount of production as conventional system. Likewise, organic farmers often
               lay down sheets of black plastic mulch over the soil to control pests and weeds, covering
               huge areas of land with single-use plastic would create an enormous amount of waste
               material in the soil. Therefore, while adopting organic agriculture, it is important
               to properly manage the negative impacts that might arise on the environment and human
               health.

            <p id="d1e1134">Lettuce fresh weight was higher in the organic management system and collard and kale
               yield was higher in the conventional production system. There was no difference in
               fresh weight of swiss chard between organic and conventional systems. Lettuce and
               swiss chard may be preferred leafy greens for organic production system though market
               price may have influence on the choice. Kale and collard performed well in conventional
               production system.
