      <p>Organic farming is often subject of heated scientific and public debates. This raises the
         question: How can scientists working in organic farming research achieve being impartial
         while simultaneously sharing enthusiasm about organic farming and promoting it as a
         solution to many of the problems of agricultural and food systems? Science needs to be
         unbiased and detached from its object of investigation. It should be hesitant to draw
         conclusions. Public statements must wait until evidence is strong and reproducible. Complex
         matters need to be communicated in a differentiated way that acknowledges pros and cons.
         Finally, science needs to follow a strict separation of facts and opinion. In which ways
         does this culture go hand in hand with a burning passion for organic farming?</p>

      <p>In many cases, the conflict between scientific neutrality on the one hand and a vocal
         commitment and advocacy for change remains under the surface. In organic farming science,
         the slow and tedious daily business of evidence-based improvement of organic systems is
         mostly unaffected by questions of neutrality. However, studies with the potential to have a
         larger impact on politics, may quickly become drawn into this conflict. A recent example is
         the study on massive insect decline published by Hallmann et al. 
         [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R01">1</xref>]. Based on long-term collection of insects the study showed
         how insect biomass has strongly decreased over the past decades. While the trend, in view
         of previously published work, as recently reviewed       [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R02">2</xref>], was
         not so surprising to many experts, the suddenness and intensity of the ensuing
         international public response was astonishing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R03">3</xref>]. Another example
         is the discussion about the appropriateness of new plant breeding techniques for the
         organic sector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R04">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R05">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R06">6</xref>].</p>

      <p>Paradoxically, the fight over the correct interpretation of scientific results and the way
         forward seems to intensify even as scientifically gained ‘knowledge’ accumulates. The
         discussions become particularly polarised when they cultivate an image of an unbiased
         scientific expert who imparts his or her view exclusively based on facts. Fundamentally,
         however, most agricultural scientific enquiries contain strong normative elements. The
         concept of ‘pure facts’, which are completely separate from any valuations or value-based
         choices, may make sense in some branches of fundamental science. In agriculture, however,
         facts are almost always wrapped in multiple layers of value-laden contexts. This is
         particularly relevant for organic farming, and for its relationship with non-organic
         farming.</p>

      <p>As a practice and a movement, but also as an object of scientific enquiry, organic farming
         is inextricably connected to several high-level aims, such as the promotion of health, as
         expressed in the IFOAM principles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R07">7</xref>]. Too often, however, instead of
         asking what really contributes to these aims and principles, the aims we are studying are
         those we can measure easily. Further, once we start thinking about how high-level
         principles can be translated into measureable outcomes, it becomes clear that this again is
         always entailing value-based choices. </p>

      <p>My expectation is that many of the global problems agriculture is facing do possibly not
         become a lot easier to solve with new scientifically established facts (nor with novel
         technologies, regardless of their compatibility with organic farming). Instead, they are
         fundamentally problems of clashing values and need a thorough and honest societal debate on
         how we want to live. The many trade-offs (e.g. between productivity and biodiversity) that
         are likely to remain largely intractable by technological or ecological advances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R08">8</xref>] will force us to make choices—evidence-based, of course,
         but building on values and principles. Therefore, the agricultural sciences need to build a
         stronger culture of normative education and debate. Significant progress needs to be made
         with regard to several questions: If there are limits to endless growth, what are we
         willing to sacrifice to achieve a more sustainable way of life and what is so essential we
         need to keep it? Is there a set and hierarchy of aims relevant for (organic) agriculture we
         can agree on, including those outside the organic sector? How do we best discuss our aims
         and arrive at acceptable, and accepted conclusions? How are these aims and principles
         integrated in research, in agricultural advice, in practice, and in policy making? How do
         we assess aims and outcomes across multiple, potentially conflicting aims?</p>

      <p>While scientific methods have been developed to address many of these questions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R09">9</xref>], there is a lack of implementation by regularly and
         systematically integrating these into agricultural research. The organic movement has
         already long-term experience in dealing with these issues and it could therefore become a
         motor for innovation and change in this important area.</p>
