                                 is a lack of a consistent approach which hampers the transformative potential that
                                 otherwise could be achieved.  To better understand how gender has been incorporated
                                 in relation to gender, we therefore conducted a systematic review of the literature
                                 that combined feminist approaches and Human Security from 1994 (Human Security's inception)
                                 to June 2018. In exploring this literature, the following questions were addressed:
                                 (a) How is criticism and support of Human Security framed in feminist research? (b)
                                 How are gender and feminist research (values) defined in relation to Human Security?
                                 (c) Which feminist approaches to Human Security are taken? (d) How do these feminist
                                 approaches dismiss or support Human Security and which trends emerge? We found that
                                 most studies solely focus on integrating women in the Human Security debate, while
                                 men, masculinities, and/or causes of structural inequalities and insecurities remain
                                 unaddressed. Studies that address structural inequalities and discuss both men and
                                 women come from critical feminist and intersectional backgrounds. We conclude that
                                 most gendered approaches to Human Security still need to fully incorporate feminist
                                 approaches to be able to truly challenge global gendered inequalities and insecurities.</span></div>

                              <p id="d1e102">In a widely cited special issue on Human Security in 2004, the editors argued that
                                 Human Security (HS) [<a href="#R1">1</a>] had come to a halt before it had even realized its potential [<a href="#R2">2</a>]. Challenging this debate, Hoogensen and StuvÃ¸j [<a href="#R3">3</a>] argued that taking a gendered perspective would allow HS to realize its potential.
                                 Both seek to challenge the notions of power and identity. By recognizing gender dynamics,
                                 the âârelational and power positions of various identitiesââ ([<a href="#R3">3</a>], p.&nbsp;225) can be unfolded by bringing in a critical bottom-up perspective. By including
                                 a gendered perspective, context, relationality and intersubjectivity which affect
                                 insecurities can be further explored [<a href="#R3">3</a>, <a href="#R4">4</a>]. In turn, this would allow for a move to an equitable and inclusive society where
                                 all are included. Nonetheless, literature continues to take diverging perspective
                                 towards its understanding gender and its integration into human security. Inspired
                                 by Hoogensen and StuvÃ¸jâs argument [<a href="#R3">3</a>], this article therefore sets out to examine how gender has been used in conjunction
                                 to HS. To this end, we reviewed the literature on gender and HS since HSâ emergence
                                 in 1994 until June 2018 with the following two research questions in mind: Which feminist
                                 approaches to Human Security are taken? And to what extent has the literature developed
                                 a (uniform) gendered HS approach? By understanding how the debate on gender and human
                                 security has developed over time, we aim to contribute to a more nuanced discussion
                                 that allows human security to be truly inclusive of the different experience of the
                                 individuals.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e126">To answer these research questions, we employed a systematic literature review to
                                 assess and synthesize the existing literature on HS and gender in a consistent and
                                 as objective possible manner. Through the review we address the following sub-questions:<br/>
                                 a) How is Human Security framed in feminist research? <br/>b) How are gender and feminist
                                 research (values) defined in relation to Human Security? <br/>c) Which feminist approaches
                                 to Human Security are taken? <br/>d) How do these feminist approaches dismiss or support
                                 Human Security and which trends emerge? <br/>By asking these questions we seek to
                                 establish to what extent scholars have formulated a uniform gendered HS approach and
                                 if any trends can be discerned. We conclude by outlining possible implications of
                                 our findings for a gendered HS approach. Before setting out the analysis, we set out
                                 an overview of the methodological approach taken as well as a brief summary on the
                                 studies that comprised our dataset.

                              <p id="d1e131">To assess how scholars have combined Human Security and gender (research), we adopted
                                 a systematic literature review approach, which is a qualitative approach that allows
                                 us to analyze a large amount of studies and map them alongside various categories.
                                 It adopts a systematic approach to addressing the literature that seeks to limit the
                                 bias on the side of the author that otherwise may influence reviews [<a href="#R5">5</a>]. In our study, we seek to understand firstly, which approaches to human security
                                 have been taken, and secondly, how gender has been conceptualized in the studies,
                                 and lastly, how the gendered HS approach is informed by the feminist approaches and
                                 approaches towards HS [<a href="#R6">6</a>]. To date, we have not come across a similar systematic literature review on this
                                 topic. This section first sets out the protocol for the systematic literature review
                                 based on the guidelines outlined by Petticrew and Roberts [<a href="#R5">5</a>] (see <b>Appendix A</b>  for a flow diagram). Next, it discusses the methodological approach taken before
                                 briefly describing the sample of studies.

                                       for studies that featured a combination of ââhuman securityââ and a gender-related
                                       idiom in their title, which included any of the following terms: gender, gendering,
                                       engendering, gendered, women, woman, men, man, feminism, feminist, femininity, masculinity.
                                       The underlying assumption is that a study that features these keywords in the title
                                       is more likely to focus on these topics in detail and seek to contribute to the specific
                                       discussion. We would like to recognize that this may result in a potential bias as
                                       the author may perceive human security as a relevant topic for study and thus may
                                       not necessarily take a critical approach towards human security. Further,we realize
                                       that this search query may have excluded studies that actually address HS and gender
                                       but do not indicate this in their title. Nonetheless, we posit that the search criteria
                                       are warranted as we focus on studies that dealt with these topics explicitly rather
                                       than merely peripherally.

                                       (e.g., articles, books, edited volumes, chapters from editorial books), and published

                                       Scholar, Google Books, Web of Science, Scopus and JStore. As each database is constructed
                                       differently, we need to recognize that the compiled literature is by no means exhaustive,
                                       and studies may have been left out. Also, by using multiple search strings and various
                                       databases, sources may come up several times. These searches were conducted at two
                                       moments in time: first, between October 7 and November 4, 2016, and the second search
                                       was conducted on July 5, 2018 [<a href="#R8">8</a>]. In total, 429 entries were identified.

                                       Consequently, 108 studies were excluded during this step. We then inspected the studies
                                       more closely and removed studies that did not feature our inclusion keywords in the
                                       title (N = 14) or were written in a foreign language although their title and abstract
                                       were written in English (N = 9). Furthermore, we only included peer-reviewed articles,
                                       books, chapters, working papers and PhD theses that were available in print or online.
                                       Accordingly, we removed book reviews, I/NGO reports, flyers, conference papers, op-eds
                                       and unavailable studies (N = 110). Lastly, eight edited volumes and single chapters
                                       came up in the search engine. To avoid double counting, we included the individual
                                       chapters and excluded the edited volume. Consequently, we were left with a total of
                                       180 studies.

                                       double-entries (N = 52). This left us with a total of 128 studies that remained subject
                                       to the inclusion/exclusion criteria as part of the second stage exclusion.

                                       as well as quality assurance. In terms of quality assurance, this led to the exclusion
                                       of three articles due to their poor English academic standard. As for the theoretical
                                       considerations, we are interested in he usage of Human Security as a paradigm and
                                       approach that was conceived by the UN in 1994, rather than a general description of
                                       the security of humans that is not linked to the HS paradigm as outlined by the UN
                                       in 1994.Therefore, we distinguished between <i>Human Security</i> the paradigm (we referred to this as <i>ââHSââ</i>) and human security as denoting the security of humans (we referred to this as <i>ââhsââ</i>). This resulted in the exclusion of twenty-three sources. Further, if the article
                                       only includes HS or gender as a byline and do not discuss these in further detail,
                                       the study was also excluded (N = 10). In total, thirty-six studies were excluded during
                                       this phase.

                                       it comes to gender and HS. Each study was analyzed according to the following categories:
                                       definitions of gender; understanding of gender/feminist research; definitions of HS;
                                       stance on HS; and gendered HS approach taken.â<b>Appendix B</b>  illustrates a sample analysis for three articles.

                                       sub-questions. This phase consists of three stages. Firstly, each category was coded
                                       according to its definitions. These codes were next grouped together to identify emerging
                                       patters. Secondly, ââgenderââ and ââgender or feminist researchââ were compared as
                                       this additional layer of clustering allowed for an in-depth understanding of emerging
                                       trends. Lastly, the category identified as ââApproach to Human Security and genderââ
                                       assessed how studiesâ definitions of gender and gender research overlapped with their
                                       understanding of HS.

                                       The systematic literature review firstly, allows for a closer examination on how HS
                                       has been envisioned by various authors. Secondly, it sets out the approaches taken
                                       towards gender and how this reflects different strands of feminist approaches. Lastly,
                                       it allows us to relate the conceptualization of gendered HS or lack thereof, back
                                       to the underlying theoretical foundations.

                                    <p id="d1e201">Our sample comprised a diverse dataset, although some characteristics were more prevalent
                                       than others (see <b>Appendix B</b>  for an overview of all sample characteristics). The majority of studies were chapters
                                       and articles that based their research on theoretical data sources, and secondary
                                       and primary qualitative data, in the form of informants. If based on qualitative data,
                                       the sample size was often not mentioned. As most studies applied a universal level
                                       of analysis, it is not surprising that most studies did not specify their geographical
                                       focus. Those with a more specific geographical focus tended to focus on Sub-Saharan
                                       Africa and Southeast Asia by either taking a regional or national level of analysis.
                                       Our dataset therefore largely originates from academic circles, is largely theoretical
                                       and qualitative, and takes a more universal perspective.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e206">In terms of distribution over time, most studies were published between 2004 and 2014
                                       (see Figure <a href="#Fig1">1</a>). Due to the limited sample size and the general academic publication climate (e.g.,
                                       slow publication processes, academic pressures), it is difficult to hypothesize what
                                       caused this peak and what led to its decline. Nonetheless, the United Nations Security
                                       Council Resolution 1325, passed in 2000, resulted in an increased attention to women-peace-and-security-related
                                       issues in academic and policy circles, which may explain part of the increase in publications.

                                    <p id="d1e224">In line with Alkire [<a href="#R9">9</a>], we found no prevalent definition of HS, instead multiple definitions of HS prevailed.
                                       So while we were able to identify numerous overarching characteristics, we found it
                                       impossible to pinpoint one definition that could be representative of HS within the
                                       academic debate. Generally, HS is used to refer to a variety of components that are
                                       generally linked to political, economic, and social structures that consequently ensure
                                       the achievement of human security with some arguing the need to go beyond these securities
                                       and include all threats to human security (see [<a href="#R10">10</a>]). Without understanding the complexity and the various facets that are referred
                                       to when conceptualizing HS, it is difficult to contextualize the term. To do so, two
                                       elements are worthwhile to discuss in more detail, namely the role of the state and
                                       the transnational nature of human security.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e232">Firstly, the role of the state in bringing about human security should be considered.
                                       While a holistic definition of HS recognizes a bottom-up approach alongside the stateâs
                                       responsibility to ensure human security, only a small number of articles explicitly
                                       address this. While HS may be seen as an alternative, addition or impediment to national
                                       security, the state has the main responsibility to bring about human security. Again,
                                       this aspect may relate back to the human rights angle as well as the security discourse
                                       in general. Thus, by never fully embracing the bottom-up perspective and the inclusion
                                       of civil society, it seemingly fails to disentangle itself from a more narrow approach
                                       to HS.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e234">This brings to the foreground a more general challenge, namely the underlying transnational
                                       character of human security. While HS concerns the security of the individual and
                                       its community, many issues that affect the human go beyond borders, e.g., pandemics,
                                       environmental disasters, conflicts. To address these issues, one often looks towards
                                       the international community and state actors. Subsequently, the importance of considering
                                       power dynamics and holding patriarchal institution accountable should be underlined
                                       if one wants to achieve human security [<a href="#R11">11</a>, <a href="#R12">12</a>]. This in turn links back to the local-global dynamics and interconnected dynamics,
                                       all of which makes feminist approaches more valuable as they address the underlying
                                       (unequal) structures of human security.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e242">To analyze the identified HS definitions more systematically, each study was assigned
                                       an overarching HS-definition category. In this, we followed Tadjbakhsh and Chenoy
                                       ([<a href="#R13">13</a>], p.&nbsp;121) who argue that HS definitions fall on a scale that increasingly becomes
                                       more holistic. That is, definitions can be placed on a scale that becomes increasingly
                                       more holistic as the definitions moveâfrom left to rightâfrom solely advancing the
                                       (a) freedom from critical fear to include (b) freedom of <i>critical want</i> to include (c) freedom to <i>enlarged want</i> to finally include (d) the freedom to live life in dignity, which is the most <i>holistic</i> definition of HS. HS definitions that focus on <i>critical fear</i> are therefore most closely related to more narrow traditional national security definitions
                                       that place more emphasis on the role of the state; e.g. Canadaâs HS understanding
                                       or studies that focus on the Responsibility to Protect. HS definitions that focus
                                       on critical want and enlarged want straddle the center of the scale and are increasingly
                                       broader, more holistic, and human rights focused ([<a href="#R13">13</a>], p.&nbsp;47).<i>Critical want</i> seeks to ensure peopleâs basic needs, while <i>enlarged want</i> takes this one step further by ensuring access to choices and therefore enables oneâs
                                       capabilities. The broadest HS definitions are most <i>holistic</i> and as such do not only advance all freedoms of want and fear but call for the freedom
                                       to achieve these in dignity; e.g., the <i>HS Now</i> report and the 1994 UNDP report promote HS as a people-centered approach that ensures
                                       human development and promotes human rights and a life in dignity.
                                       
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e275">Accordingly, we found that the studiesâ HS definitions were distributed along this
                                       scale as follows: 3 studies called for <i>Critical fear</i> HS definitions, 8 for <i>Critical want</i>, 34 for <i>Enlarged want</i>, and 50 called for <i>Holistic</i> definitions. When examining the distribution over the years (see Figure <a href="#Fig2">2</a>), we found that <i>Critical fear</i> and <i>Critical want</i> definitions had marginally decreased, <i>Enlarged want</i> definitions had significantly decreased, and <i>Holistic</i> definitions had significantly increased. Thus, it emerges that there is a general
                                       trend towards a more holistic understandings of HS in the literature.

                                    <p id="d1e315">Human Security has the potential to account for a ââcosmopolitan formulation of security
                                       and as theoretical and practical tool for peaceââ ([<a href="#R14">14</a>], p.&nbsp;87). It has the potential to bridge different strands of security scholars (such
                                       as feminists security studies, critical theory and the Copenhagen School) in âânew
                                       and potentially transformative waysââ due to their common normative assumptions ([<a href="#R15">15</a>], p.&nbsp;37). Though this is not necessarily agreed upon by all as another argued that
                                       HS was no novel contribution to security studies (see [<a href="#R16">16</a>]) and may even perpetuate a neoliberal perspective (see [<a href="#R17">17</a>]).
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e329">In their discussion on Human Security the majority of authors place critical notes
                                       alongside HS. These notes pertain to primarily to the inclusion of a gendered or feminist
                                       perspective (N = 41) (e.g. [<a href="#R3">3</a>, <a href="#R18">18</a>, <a href="#R19">19</a>, <a href="#R20">20</a>, <a href="#R21">21</a>]) and to a lesser extent recognition of ethics of care [<a href="#R22">22</a>], and power and empowerment (see [<a href="#R23">23</a>, <a href="#R24">24</a>]). Additionally, some call for HS studies to be grounded in ethnography that clarified
                                       the position of the researcher to avoid overlooking research subjectivities [<a href="#R10">10</a>, <a href="#R25">25</a>, <a href="#R26">26</a>].
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e365">Importantly, three articles that criticize the conceptualization of Human Security
                                       argue that womenâs security is not equal to peopleâs security, a discussion that can
                                       be linked back to early feminist debates on ââwho counts as human.ââ They question
                                       whose perspective is included and who is excluded [<a href="#R4">4</a>, <a href="#R27">27</a>, <a href="#R28">28</a>]. This feminist discussion of who is included in discussions relating to human security
                                       is taken up in several studies. As Marhia [<a href="#R4">4</a>] states, ââhumanââ implies a referent object of security, provided subjectivity,
                                       exclusion and social status are sufficiently considered. Ellen Lammers [<a href="#R10">10</a>] draws out another often excluded security perspective, namely the security of refugees.
                                       Unlike national security, HS has the possible ability to advance gendered security
                                       dimensions and make audible the voices of those marginalized or most vulnerable, as
                                       well non-citizens. Only one article specifically refers to the human security of citizens
                                       [<a href="#R14">14</a>], whereas several others refer to those affected by conflict and displacement [<a href="#R10">10</a>, <a href="#R11">11</a>, <a href="#R29">29</a>].
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e395">HS furthermore needs to be cognizant on the role of the state. Some even indicate
                                       that if HS is co-opted by the state, this may result in further polarization of civil
                                       society which would in turn prevent the attainment of a gender equal society [<a href="#R11">11</a>, <a href="#R30">30</a>, <a href="#R31">31</a>].
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e406">The above analysis showcases that most studies call for a more detailed discussion
                                       of themes such as power, empowerment, women, gender dimensions, the role of the state
                                       and a more detailed account of researcherâs positionality. Their definitions of HS,
                                       however, are not uniform within the reviewed literature. Since certain components
                                       of power, gendered structures, patriarchy and neoliberal perspectives can perpetuate
                                       human <i>insecurity</i>, it is essential to explore HS in relation to gender to establish the various gendered
                                       HS approaches that studies have taken over the years. Therefore, we next set out to
                                       examine the respective feminist studies approaches taken and the conceptualization
                                       of gender, and how these relate to each other.

                                    <p id="d1e417">In this section, we identified the studiesâ feminist subcategories either based on
                                       their explicit self-identified subcategory (N = 40) or by assigning them a subcategory
                                       that they drew upon most in their study, if the authors did not explicitly self-identify
                                       themselves. The more critically and directly the studies were engaged with feminist
                                       literature, the more likely they were to self-identify with a feminist subcategory.
                                       For example, the most critically and radically engaged form of feminism, Postmodern
                                       Feminism, was self-identified (N = 5), whereas for the least critical form of feminist
                                       research, Mainstream Feminism, only 1 author self-identified.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e419">Before we provide a more detailed account of the distribution of these feminist subcategories,
                                       a clearer explanation of our understanding of these subcategories is warranted. In
                                       total, we identified eight such subcategories: <i>Mainstream Feminism, Mainstream Feminism drawing on Feminist Security Studies (FSS),
                                          Critical Feminism, Postcolonial Feminism, Third World Feminism, Poststructural Feminism,
                                          Postmodern Feminism, and Ecofeminism.</i>
                                       
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e424">The least critical approach of them is <i>Mainstream Feminism</i>, which seeks the equality of men and women by focusing on the plight of women, e.g.,
                                       Gender-Based Violence (GBV). Mainstream Feminism does not integrate established, critical
                                       feminist approaches and scholars, and does not integrate social categories such as
                                       race and class [<a href="#R32">32</a>]. <i>Mainstream FeminismâFSS</i> is similar to Mainstream Feminismâs focus but differs in that it has its analytical
                                       base in Feminist Security Studies. <i>Mainstream Feminism</i>âFSS does not engage with feminist research and often only focuses on the UNSCR 1325,
                                       which addresses the need to protect women and seeks to integrate women in peacebuilding
                                       processes based on their assumed inherent mothering peacefulness. The focus on the
                                       dichotomy between men and women is precisely where Mainstream Feminist approaches
                                       (i.e., both <i>Mainstream Feminism</i> and <i>Mainstream FeminismâFSS</i>) differ from more critical feminist approaches that places a larger importance on
                                       the differences <i>within</i> male and female groups. Therefore, many Mainstream Feminists draw on gender stereotypes
                                       that in turn are rejected by critical approaches.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e448">
                                       <i>Critical Feminism</i>, on the other hand, draws on intersectionality and thereby addresses inequalities
                                       that are results of power-imbalances along the lines of identities, such as gender,
                                       ethnicity, race, religion, sexuality, etc. As such, Critical Feminist approaches often
                                       align with the understandings and approaches of <i>Postmodern</i> and/or <i>Poststructural Feminism</i>. It regards feminism as an issue of not only gender but other identities of oppression.
                                       <i>Postcolonial Feminism</i> is similar to Critical Feminismâs approach (i.e., intersectionality) but it focuses
                                       on the needs of indigenous people (often women) who have been marginalized. It is
                                       therefore heavily engaged with issues of racism and colonialism. <i>Third World Feminism</i> is similar to Postcolonial Feminismâs focus but differs in that it insists on indigenously
                                       defined understandings of feminism. <i>Poststructural Feminism</i> is heavily inspired by Judith Butlerâs work and regards gender as a social construct
                                       of an interplay of language, sociology, subjectivity and power-relations. Poststructural
                                       Feminism often engages in literary analyses as it tends to focus on discourses. <i>Postmodern Feminismâs</i> understanding of gender is the same as Poststructural Feminismâs although Postmodern
                                       Feminism is more radical in its approach and goals. It seeks to undo societyâs patriarchal
                                       norms by rejecting all gender essentialism, falsifying gendered dichotomies, and promoting
                                       subjectivities to highlight diversity and difference within groups of men and within
                                       groups of women, rather than solely looking at differences between these groups.

                                    <p id="d1e472">Finally, <i>Ecofeminism</i> sees the historic abuse and domination of women and the environment as comparable
                                       as both have been exploited and regarded as helpless. As such, ecofeminists argue
                                       that true equality cannot be achieved for as long as someone/something is treated
                                       as subordinate, including the environment. This category can be seen as separate from
                                       critical and mainstream approaches.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e477">Interestingly, the studies are evenly split into two overarching feminist camps: critical
                                       and mainstream feminist approaches (both comprise 46 studies). Only 3 studies were
                                       classified as <i>Ecofeminism</i>. When examining the classifications in more depth, we conclude that most studies
                                       draw on an intersectional approach in their analysis (<i>Critical Feminism</i>, N = 27) or take a more mainstream feminist approach that is rooted in FSS (N = 26),
                                       with the remaining twenty drawing on <i>Mainstream Feminism</i>. On the other hand, we find that more critical approaches are taken more rarely:
                                       <i>Postcolonial Feminism</i> (N = 8), <i>Postmodern Feminism</i> (N = 5), <i>Poststructural Feminism</i> (N = 3), and <i>Third World Feminism</i> (N = 3).
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e501">Over time, studies drawing on <i>Critical Feminism</i> and <i>Mainstream Feminism drawing on FSS</i> have steadily increased, whereas studies from Mainstream Feminist backgrounds have
                                       slightly decreased. Finally, studies from all other branches have remained static
                                       and minimal over the years. This indicates an increased interest in drawing on established
                                       critical feminist approaches and/or mainstream feminist security studies.

                                    <p id="d1e512">When analyzing the authorâs understanding of gender, we applied the same principles
                                       as we did for analyzing the studiesâ subcategory of feminist studies. In about half
                                       of the studies, the authorsâ understanding of gender was explicitly defined. For the
                                       other half, we assigned understandings of gender based on their application of the
                                       word gender. When looking at all studies, we found that the majority of studies used
                                       gender to refer to and focus solely on women; thirty-four studies used gender to refer
                                       to both women and men, and only two studies focus on men. Both studies that focus
                                       on men and masculinity either do so in the context of displacement in Tanzania [<a href="#R29">29</a>] or in Iraqi conflict [<a href="#R17">17</a>] and its effect on perceived masculinity.

                                    <p id="d1e520">When we examined the how the understanding and focus of ââgenderââ developed over

                                       a focus on both men and women decreased slightly. This increase in the focus on women
                                       is likely related to the fact that Mainstream Feminism drawing on FSS (which largely
                                       uses ââgenderââ to focus on women) has continued to increase over the years.

                                    <p id="d1e525">The more a study engages with critical feminist approaches, the more its usage of
                                       gender moves from ââwomenââ to ââboth genders.ââ Similarly, the majority of critical
                                       feminist studies reflects on the gender stereotypes and roles of both women and men;
                                       with the exception of studies drawing on Postcolonial and Third World Feminisms where
                                       the majority focuses on women (see [<a href="#R33">33</a>]). We assume that a studyâs focus on women when referring to gender can largely be
                                       attributed to that studyâs respective wider field continuing to struggle to include
                                       women. For example, <i>Mainstream FSS</i> focuses on women because the wider security studies field continues to neglect women
                                       in its analyses; for example, Chenoy [<a href="#R34">34</a>] argues that national security (studies) is a patriarchal construct that needs to
                                       be challenged by focusing on the security of women. Critical feminist approaches (i.e.,
                                       <i>Critical Feminism, Poststructural Feminism</i>, and <i>Postmodern Feminism</i>) on the other hand, have gone beyond the inclusion of women and instead focus on
                                       both genders to investigate how gender is enacted. For example, Natalie Hudson [<a href="#R21">21</a>] categorically challenges and rejects the widespread misuse of ââgenderââ as ââwomenââ
                                       and Heidi Hudson [<a href="#R22">22</a>] shows that this misuse blurs out not only the importance of masculinities but also
                                       the vast varieties of in-group differences amongst women and men. Accordingly, studies
                                       drawing on the most critical approach, <i>Postmodern Feminism</i>, exclusively focus on both genders. Lastly, <i>Critical Feminism</i> is the only approach that includes studies focusing solely on men. This can be seen
                                       as a counterbalance to the persistence of less critical feminist approaches that focus
                                       on women alone. The next section seeks to understand how the feminist studies subcategories
                                       relate back to the different gendered HS approaches taken in the literature.

                                    <p id="d1e561">Having examined all studies, we identified six overarching gendered HS approaches
                                       which the studies had taken: thirty-seven studies called for a gendering of the HS
                                       paradigm by providing a <i>Gender Approach to HS</i>, twenty called for a <i>Gender as an Add-on</i> to HS analyses, sixteen percent were interested in the <i>HS of Women</i>, thirteen regarded <i>Gender as inherent to HS</i>, eight provided a <i>Feminist Critique of HS</i>, and only one article believed <i>HS was a tool to advance feminist agendas</i>.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e582">In general, we found that the identified gendered HS approaches fell into two overarching
                                       categories: (a) approaches that were more gender-aware (i.e., <i>Gender Approach to HS, Gender as an Add-on</i>, and <i>Feminist Critique of HS</i>), and (b) approaches that were less gender-aware (i.e., <i>HS as a tool to advance feminist agendas, HS of Women, and Gender as inherent to HS</i>). More gender-aware approaches drew on feminist themes, issues, principles, guidelines
                                       and/or theories; while their less gender-aware counterparts tended to focus on womenâs
                                       issues alone without drawing on feminist theories to make their argument.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e593">Studies that advocate for a <i>Gender Approach to HS</i> do so in numerous ways: a gendering of HS to avoid a perpetuation of existing gendered
                                       structures (see [<a href="#R28">28</a>]), an inclusion of intersectional theories in HS analyses (see [<a href="#R35">35</a>]), a feminist perspective that investigates ââwhoââ is included when politicians
                                       and scholars speak of ââhumansââ (see [<a href="#R20">20</a>]), a revival of HS from a postmodern feminist perspective (see [<a href="#R36">36</a>]), and the inclusion of discussions about masculinities as well as femininities to
                                       account for victimized men and agentic women [<a href="#R17">17</a>]. Although these studies call on different means or particular aspects of feminist
                                       research, all of them do so to bring about a more specific and systematic <i>Gender Approach to HS</i>. To exemplify, the analysis on homeworkers in Thailand by Sasaki et al. [<a href="#R37">37</a>] recognizes that the lived economic experiences for men and women differ. In the
                                       absence of formal protection by the State, relational networks are employed to mitigate
                                       insecurities. Nonetheless, these networks may perpetuate the patriarchal structures
                                       in turn. A <i>Gender Approach to HS</i> thus contributes to capturing how gendered structures should be unfolded to understand
                                       the experiences of human insecurity.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e623">Studies that advocate <i>Gender as an Add-on to HS</i> distinguish themselves from the previously described approach in that they do not
                                       call on feminist theories and instead call for a more schematic inclusion of gender
                                       issues. As long as patriarchy persists, women are seen as responsible for the wellbeing
                                       and HS of families and communities. Unless ââgender equality and authentic democracy
                                       in all spheres of social organizationââ ([<a href="#R38">38</a>], p.&nbsp;30) are not recognized, human security is difficult to achieve. Or to put it
                                       in other words, an analysis that considers the specific gender issues is thus beneficial
                                       to understand ââthe complex interplay between different dimensions of security as
                                       well as short- and long-term consequences and their impact on gender relationsââ ([<a href="#R39">39</a>], p.&nbsp;22). Under this categorization, studies therefore call for an awareness of gender
                                       issues in relation to HS (see [<a href="#R25">25</a>]), a recognition that men and women experience different insecurities (see [<a href="#R24">24</a>]), an inclusion of gender equality measures in HS analyses (see [<a href="#R40">40</a>]) and a close attention to GBV [<a href="#R38">38</a>, <a href="#R41">41</a>].
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e650">Other studies undertake a <i>Feminist Critique of HS</i> to argue that HSâ focus on the ââhumanââ blinds it from recognizing the ââotherââ
                                       and perpetuates a masculinist discourse (see [<a href="#R42">42</a>]). Marhia [<a href="#R4">4</a>] therefore argues that a critical feminist perspective to human security is important
                                       to address this power imbalance and to avoid ââreproduction of such structural inequalities,
                                       violences and insecuritiesââ ([<a href="#R4">4</a>], p.&nbsp;32). Others state highlight how a feminist analysis of HS reveals that HS is
                                       part of the wider global capitalist system and therefore complicit in perpetuating
                                       inequality (see [<a href="#R21">21</a>, <a href="#R43">43</a>]). Unless the global economic system is restructured, so Randriamaro [<a href="#R43">43</a>] argues, women in Sub-Sahara Africa will continue to face challenges in ensuring
                                       their rights, economic justice, and environmental integrity. Yet, some even go to
                                       the extent stating that HS provides no new contribution that feminist security studies
                                       has not already made (see [<a href="#R16">16</a>]).
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e677">One study argues that HS, unlike traditional national security paradigms, is uniquely
                                       suited to advancing feminist agendas (see [<a href="#R44">44</a>]). This approach to regard <i>HS as a tool to advance feminist agendas</i> is therefore a unique and optimistic outlier in this dataset. However, this article
                                       does not provide clear feminist theories or guidelines as to how this could be accomplished.
                                       We, therefore, grouped this approach into the overarching category of less-gender
                                       aware gendered HS approaches.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e685">Studies that are interested in the <i>HS of Women</i> investigate a variety of human insecurities. It argues that if women are not taken
                                       as a separate category, it risks that the vulnerabilities and threat that women face,
                                       such as violence against women and girls or the Human Rights of women, are sidelined
                                       (e.g. [<a href="#R10">10</a>, <a href="#R45">45</a>]). This approach varies from the <i>Gender as an Add-on Approach</i> in that this approach focuses on females and their insecurities. In addition, it
                                       allows for capturing the needs of specific groups of women such as: the increasing
                                       human insecurities of indigenous women in the Arctic through the current politicization
                                       of institutions [<a href="#R46">46</a>] or the environmental challenges [<a href="#R47">47</a>], or disempowerment of the tribal women in the Odisha region in India (see [<a href="#R48">48</a>]). It can next call attention to specific policy challenges such as the failure of

                                    <p id="d1e739">When we compared the studiesâ HS-gender approaches in relation to their level of analysis,
                                       we found that both favored a Gender Approach to HS. We did however, find three minor
                                       differences that reflected disciplinary trends and differences. Studies that focus
                                       on the community and local level tend to take a more ethnographic or anthropological
                                       approach. In doing so, we found that these local level studies are more interested
                                       in the HS of Women. For example, based on ethnographic observations and interviews,

                                       can only fully embody HS principles and thereby secure vulnerable women when they
                                       are integrated into other broader programs and institutional mandates.

                                    <p id="d1e744">Global level analyses, on the other hand, tended to be of a more theoretical nature
                                       and often came from a Political Science or Gender Research. These disciplinary differences
                                       resulted in global level analyses that either treated Gender as an add-on to HS or
                                       they engaged in a more serious Feminist Critique of HS. One such example of a study
                                       that calls for Gender as an add-on to HS is Radu [<a href="#R55">55</a>] who, based on a political analysis of UN and EU legal frameworks and Romanian legislation,
                                       argues that HS needs to integrate gender and equal opportunities as a new dimension
                                       to be able to fully understand and ensure the security of all humans. Clough and Willse

                                       indicates their predominantly favored approach to HS and gender. For example, feminist
                                       study subcategories that focus on ââbothââ genders all tend to favor a <i>Gender Approach to HS</i>, This corresponds to <i>Postmodern</i>, <i>Poststructural</i>, and <i>Critical Feminism</i> in particular.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e793">On the other hand, feminist studies subcategories focusing on ââwomenââ are more scattered
                                       in their predominantly chosen approach although they favor approaches that seek <i>Gender as an Add-on</i> and a <i>HS Analysis of Women</i>. Studies categorized as either <i>Mainstream</i>, <i>Mainstream FSS</i> tend to favor both approaches equally. Only a minority of studies categorized as
                                       <i>Critical Feminism</i> followed either approach which is in line with the recognition of power imbalances
                                       affecting the realization of human security, which would not be addressed by solely
                                       looking at women or adding the insecurities of women as an add-on to Human Security.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e810">Though only three studies place themselves in the field of <i>Ecofeminism</i>, the approach taken to both their conceptualization of gender as well their approaches
                                       show a much more diverse picture. Due to the limited sample size, we can therefore
                                       not assign any interpretation to this.

                                       in order to ask ââwhat does gender do?ââ are largely interested in <i>Gender Approach to HS</i> and thus, take a more radical rethinking of HS. Whereas those feminist subcategories
                                       that use ââgenderââ to focus on women to promote the inclusion of women in their respective

                                       and human security.

                              <p id="d1e829">In conclusion, four overarching HS definitions were prominent within the literature:
                                 freedom from <i>critical fear</i>, freedom of <i>critical want</i>, freedom to <i>enlarged want</i> and a <i>holistic</i> definition that calls for freedom to live life in dignity. Over the years, there
                                 has been a clear trend to increasingly move towards more holistic understandings of
                                 HS. However, when looking at their stances to Human Security in more detail, we established
                                 that most studies call for necessary additions to HS, such as power, empowerment,
                                 women, gender dimensions, the role of the state, and a more detailed discussion of
                                 the researcherâs positionality. Thus, highlighting the need for a more critical look
                                 towards how gender is incorporated when studying Human Security.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e843">When investigating the studiesâ used feminist studies subcategories, we identified
                                 two overarching feminist studies camps, namely, the more critical feminist approaches
                                 (i.e., <i>Critical Feminism, Postcolonial Feminism, Postmodern Feminism</i>, and to a lesser extent <i>Poststructural Feminism</i> and <i>Third World Feminism</i>), the mainstream feminist approaches (i.e., <i>Mainstream Feminism drawing on FSS</i>, and <i>Mainstream Feminism</i>) and an outlier (i.e., <i>Ecofeminism</i>). When assessing these feminist studies subcategories over the years, three trends
                                 emerged: (a) <i>Critical Feminism</i> and <i>Mainstream Feminism drawing on FSS</i> studies have steadily increased over the years, (b) <i>Mainstream Feminist</i> studies have slightly decreased, and (c) studies from all other branches have remained
                                 static and minimal over the years.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e873">When investigating studiesâ definitions of gender, the majority of studies used gender
                                 to refer to and focus solely on women, although a great number used gender to refer
                                 to both women and men. Only two out of ninety-five reviewed articles focused solely
                                 on men. The focus on women has increased over the years, whereas a focus on both genders
                                 decreased slightly. When relating the feminist studies subcategories back to their
                                 definition, we established that the more a study relied on critical feminist approaches,
                                 the more its usage of ââgenderââ moves from ââwomenââ to ââboth genders.ââ
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e875">Out of the six different gendered HS approaches identified, the majority of studies
                                 call for a gendering of the HS paradigm by providing a <i>Gender Approach to HS</i>, followed by <i>Gender as an Add-on to HS</i> analyses, <i>HS of Women</i>, and <i>Gender as inherent to HS</i> respectively. Only a minor part of the examined literature employs a <i>Feminist Critique of HS</i>, or regards <i>HS as a tool to advance feminist agendas</i>.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e896">All HS stances largely favored more gender-aware approaches, while broader HS definitions
                                 were more prevalent across more gender-aware gendered HS approaches. Those feminist
                                 studies subcategories that focus on both genders in order to ask ââwhat does gender
                                 do?ââ were largely interested in a <i>Gender Approach to HS</i> and thus a more radical rethinking of HS. Those feminist subcategories that used
                                 ââgenderââ to focus on women to promote the inclusion of women in their respective
                                 fields did so in order to investigate the <i>HS of Women</i> or to promote <i>Gender as an Add-on to HS</i>. Thus, the findings indicate that the appropriation of ââgenderââ by a study is thus
                                 heavily entangled with its chosen gendered HS approach.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e907">This study is therefore indicative of the relevance of a critical feminist approach
                                 to address the underlying causes of human insecurity. Thus, a gendered HS approach
                                 can only challenge global (gendered) inequalities and insecurities if it fully incorporates
                                 feminist values, as proposed by critical feminist and intersectional scholars.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e909">To further develop a critical understanding of how a gendered HS approach can enable
                                 the fulfillment of human security, we recommend a further analysis of how human security
                                 can be realized incorporating a gendered HS approach. Future research should also
                                 examine how the usage of certain sources (e.g., policy reports, studies) shapes a
                                 studyâs analytical focus and how this results in a consequent framing of gender and
                                 HS. Ideally, future study would relate this back to ongoing political and policy developments
                                 to understand how these may or may not affect the thinking in the field. Further,
                                 as our study identifies changing trends in the field of gender and HS, we suggest
                                 to periodically undertake a systematic review of this research fieldâs development
                                 to ensure a representative portrayal.

                                                but warns that placing men solely as aggressor is not helpful, 2) women as representation
                                                of other women, 3) women both as passive victim and active subjects, 4) tends to reproduce
