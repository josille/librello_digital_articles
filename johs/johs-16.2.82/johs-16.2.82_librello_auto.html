                                 labelled as a criminal gang operating in the streets of Gulu, Uganda. Based on a series
                                 of interviews, focus group discussions, participant observations, archival work and
                                 literature review, the paper traces the origin of the Aguu to the conflict in Northern
                                 Uganda, and describes the transformation of the Aguu from street youth/children linked
                                 to war and displacement to their present day labelling as ‘criminal gang’. Anchored
                                 in an analysis based on Assemblage Theory, this paper demonstrates the complexity,
                                 multiplicity and fluidity of the Aguu identity as a group whose inception and evolution,
                                 both internal and external, occurs through a process of relationship between social,
                                 political, economic and infrastructural changes linked to war, culture, aid and politics,
                                 affecting present day security discourses in Gulu, Uganda.</span></div>

                              <p id="d1e103">In July 2014 Human Rights Watch released a report titled ‘Where do you want us to
                                 go?’, dealing with abuses against street children in Uganda. The report stated that:
                                 ‘Children living on the streets… throughout Uganda’s urban centres face violence and
                                 discrimination by police, local government officials, their peers, and the communities
                                 in which they work and live’ [<a href="#R1">1</a>]. In January 2019, Christine, the daughter of Bishop Nelson Onono Onweng of the Northern
                                 Uganda Diocese, was ambushed and stabbed to death in Gulu, the principal town of Northern
                                 Uganda, and one of the most important business and commercial hubs of the region [<a href="#R2">2</a>]. During the funeral, the Deputy Speaker of the Ugandan Parliament, Honourable Jacob
                                 Oulanyah said: ‘What are we doing in our households and communities to ensure that
                                 we raise children who respect lives? It saddens me that young people are the ones
                                 killing today’. The murder of Christine Anyeko was carried out by ‘street goons’ [<a href="#R3">3</a>], or, as they are dubbed in the local youth language in Gulu: the <i>Aguu</i>.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e117">The local ‘youth language’ in Gulu is an Acholi-based linguistic practice called the
                                 <i>Leb pa Bwulu</i> [<a href="#R4">4</a>]. The language was established by youth who found themselves in the streets during
                                 and after the period of the civil war between the Ugandan People’s Defence Force (UPDF)
                                 and the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) [<a href="#R5">5</a>]. The <i>Aguu</i>, as they initially referred to themselves, is a term that denotes an association
                                 with a socially isolated group struggling to subsist within the pre-established norms,
                                 conventions, and rules of society as they are defined in the context of Northern Uganda,
                                 Gulu municipality, and the Acholi ethnic group. Literally translated, the term <i>Aguu</i> is a reference to people ‘who would do anything to get by’ [<a href="#R6">6</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e138">The <i>Aguu</i> in the streets of Gulu can be conceptualised in a variety of ways. They can be viewed
                                 as children and youth, victims of dire circumstances, that find themselves living
                                 in and/or off the streets of Gulu. They can be viewed as youth/children who made a
                                 conscious choice to leave their homesteads for various reasons and head to the streets
                                 of Gulu. They can be viewed as individuals who resorted to illicit activities as a
                                 livelihood strategy; as thugs who prey on by-passers and snatch their valuables; or
                                 as organised gangs that engage in coordinated criminal activities, and as criminals-for-hire,
                                 used as pawns in a variety of small and large conflicts for purposes of coercion,
                                 punishment, self-interest, or revenge. In a theoretical sense, the <i>Aguu</i> can be conceptualised as a group living on the boundary between what is considered
                                 normative and non-normative social behaviour in Acholi society and Gulu town [<a href="#R7">7</a>].

                              <p id="d1e149">This article focuses on human (in)security as a function of complex social, cultural
                                 and political circumstances in Northern Uganda. The particular emphasis of this article
                                 is on the relationship between the <i>Aguu</i> external and internal identity, their labelling as a youth criminal organisation,
                                 and a variety of social, security, cultural and political discourses in Gulu town
                                 about crime, safety, security and street youth/children. The aim of the article is
                                 to highlight the complexity and multiplicity of the <i>Aguu</i>, and the label ‘street gang’ assigned to them. Based on a series of interviews, participant
                                 observation, focus group discussions, and archival work conducted in Gulu between
                                 2018-2019, undertaken as part of a larger project focusing on community-oriented policing
                                 in Northern Uganda [<a href="#R8">8</a>], this article nuances the local socio-political dynamics around street youth/children
                                 in Gulu.

                              <p id="d1e160">To understand the processes of formation and transformation of the <i>Aguu</i> identity as a part of the socio-political discourses on crime and (in)security in
                                 Gulu, this article will proceed as follows: we begin by outlining the intellectual
                                 and theoretical framework linking Assemblage Theory to the analysis of youth criminal
                                 gangs, and then present the methodology and ethics for this research. We trace the
                                 origins of the <i>Aguu</i> and how their identity today is presented by different stakeholders in Gulu. We then
                                 introduce the make-up, organisation, leadership, and activities of the <i>Aguu</i> as recounted both by members of the <i>Aguu</i> and by other stakeholders in Gulu. We proceed with an analysis and discussion of
                                 the <i>Aguu</i> and the complexity of their shifting identities as part of various discursive and
                                 non-discursive multiplicities linked to crime, human security, and discourses of ‘deviance’
                                 in Gulu. And finally, we conclude this article with a note on limitations, implications,
                                 and future research.

                              <p id="d1e183">This research was conducted in 2018-2019, while Gulu was undergoing major physical
                                 and institutional changes towards achieving the status of a City in Uganda [<a href="#R9">9</a>]. During that period, when asked about the sources of crime in the streets of Gulu,
                                 the police, government officials, and members of the community at large, raised the
                                 <i>Aguu</i> and their activities as one of the major sources of insecurity. The designation ‘youth
                                 street gang’ in relation to the <i>Aguu</i> is common in modern day Gulu, and several categories of respondents referred to the
                                 <i>Aguu</i> as what seemed to designate a coherent entity which they labelled as (youth/children)
                                 ‘street gang’ and one of the main reasons for crime, disruption, and violence in contemporary
                                 Gulu. As the discourses about the <i>Aguu</i> and their identity included references to the civil-war and to street youth and children
                                 in the streets of Gulu as a function of the conflict, it became increasingly clear
                                 that the meaning of <i>Aguu</i>, as well as the identity of its ‘members’ is rather multiple and complex.

                              <p id="d1e204">In this paper, we draw from the work of Deluze and Guattari on Assemblage Theory,
                                 and subsequent work on the interpretation and application of the theory by scholars
                                 such as DeLanda and Buchanan [<a href="#R10">10</a>, <a href="#R11">11</a>, <a href="#R12">12</a>, <a href="#R13">13</a>, <a href="#R14">14</a>], to analyse the formation and re-formulation processes of the <i>Aguu</i>. Assemblage Theory has been applied for the analysis of a wide variety of complex
                                 societal contexts, including for the analysis of multiplicity and complexity in security
                                 studies [<a href="#R15">15</a>, <a href="#R16">16</a>, <a href="#R17">17</a>], policy analysis [<a href="#R18">18</a>], criminology, phenomenology, discourse studies, urban studies, street youth and
                                 gangs [<a href="#R19">19</a>, <a href="#R20">20</a>, <a href="#R21">21</a>, <a href="#R22">22</a>, <a href="#R23">23</a>, <a href="#R24">24</a>, <a href="#R25">25</a>, <a href="#R26">26</a>].

                              <p id="d1e263">Before we outline the main tenants of the Assemblage approach, we begin by problematising
                                 the concept of the ‘gang’ as an ‘entity’ to better understand the challenges around
                                 the common labelling of the <i>Aguu</i> as a homogenous group regarded as a ‘gang’ by various groups of stakeholders in Gulu.

                                    <p id="d1e271">The criminologist Don Crewe directs attention towards the fact that the term ‘gang’
                                       is an essentialisation created by external definitions that objectify and simplify
                                       the observance of a an <i>eidos</i>: a surface, an appearance, or a phenomenon ([<a href="#R20">20</a>], p.&nbsp;1001). It is often assumed that crime and violence are essential features of
                                       a ‘gang’ [<a href="#R27">27</a>]. This assumption stems from the dominant scholarship on gangs, mainly conducted
                                       in the 1970s on- and to explain and address -street gangs in the United States [<a href="#R28">28</a>, <a href="#R29">29</a>, <a href="#R30">30</a>]. Gangs were expected to be a major source of insecurity in terms of crime and violence,
                                       especially in urban spaces [<a href="#R29">29</a>, <a href="#R31">31</a>, <a href="#R32">32</a>, <a href="#R33">33</a>, <a href="#R34">34</a>]. As a consequence, when a group is labelled ‘a gang’, it becomes a ‘tautological
                                       construction’ involving ‘the relationship between gangs and violent or otherwise criminal
                                       behaviour’ ([<a href="#R20">20</a>], p.&nbsp;1003). While the assumptions linking gangs to crime and violence have dominated
                                       the scholarship on gangs, they have been contested by several scholars who offer more
                                       nuanced discourses on such groupings [<a href="#R22">22</a>, <a href="#R35">35</a>, <a href="#R36">36</a>]. In a broader sense, ‘gang’ is a simplified term for a variety of complex social
                                       groups. When a social group is labelled ‘street gang’, it immediately assumes a variety
                                       of traits including violence, crime and other behaviours that are viewed as social
                                       deviance, especially when analysed through various criminological perspectives [<a href="#R19">19</a>, <a href="#R22">22</a>]. Such perspectives presuppose an ontological reality which lead to constrained analyses
                                       of the ‘gang’. The <i>Aguu</i>, as an entity labelled ‘youth criminal gang’ by the police, local leaders, and members
                                       of the community, is an example of a such a group with an assumed predetermined identity
                                       expressed in the common contemporary discourses in Gulu. In these discourses, the
                                       <i>Aguu</i> are essentialised and described with certain properties, functions and causes. Viewing
                                       the <i>Aguu</i> in such a way serves a variety of purposes in modern day Gulu, a point we return
                                       to in our analysis. But this view of the Aguu does not address the fact that the ‘entity’
                                       is an assemblage of individuals that become ‘<i>Aguu</i>’ through internal and external processes. We use the Assemblage approach to conduct
                                       a critical analysis of the <i>Aguu</i>, asking, based on the specific situation in contemporary Gulu ‘what kind of assemblage
                                       would be required to produce it?’ ([<a href="#R13">13</a>], p.&nbsp;473). To understand the processes that lead to assemblages, it is necessary
                                       to flesh out the social, political, cultural, historical and economic forces interacting
                                       in a context that not only lead to the creation of groups such as the <i>Aguu</i>, but also govern how these groups evolve and change, how they are viewed and understood
                                       by others as a function of complex circumstances, as well as how these groups come
                                       to characterise themselves.

                                    <p id="d1e352">Assemblage Theory offers an approach to social complexity which lays emphasis on multiplicity,
                                       fluidity and change in an attempt to resist essentialism and reification that stem
                                       from definitions ([<a href="#R11">11</a>], p.&nbsp;26). Following Deluze and Guattari [<a href="#R10">10</a>], Buchanan ([<a href="#R13">13</a>], p.&nbsp;463) underlines that ‘assemblages explains the existence of a thing in the world’;
                                       they are ‘structured and structuring’; they ‘have a logic, and operational sense…that
                                       can be mapped’; and ‘always strive to persist in their being’ though ‘they are subject
                                       to forces of change…but ultimately prefer not to change’.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e363">According to DeLanda ([<a href="#R12">12</a>], pp.&nbsp;12-20), assemblages are individual entities which have an historical contingent
                                       identity. As such, assemblages can be an ‘individual person, individual community,
                                       an individual organisation, an individual city etc.’. While these entities operate
                                       at different scales, they are all viewed as assemblages, hence they have the same
                                       ontological status, and therefore can interact directly with each other ‘individual
                                       to individual’.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e368">Assemblages consist of heterogenous components, such as individual persons, but also
                                       the material and expressive objects that comprises communities and organisations.
                                       As assemblages can be individual entities on different scales, they can ‘become component
                                       parts of larger assemblages’. Linked to the problematisation of the ‘gang’ above,
                                       the study of the <i>Aguu</i> as an assemblage focuses on the <i>sui-generis</i> properties and the situational contexts that produces it as an entity ([<a href="#R22">22</a>], pp.&nbsp;130-131). On another level, the <i>Aguu</i> as an ‘entity’ is also a part of an assemblage where a relationship exists with other
                                       entities such as the police, local leadership, and communities in the space of Gulu
                                       municipality [<a href="#R37">37</a>], in which they are perceived as a ‘gang’. This view of the <i>Aguu</i> as an assemblage with <i>sui-generis</i> properties [<a href="#R38">38</a>, <a href="#R39">39</a>, <a href="#R40">40</a>, <a href="#R41">41</a>, <a href="#R42">42</a>], and the <i>Aguu</i> in an assemblage where they are labelled as an homogenised (criminal) entity allows
                                       us to analyse the <i>Aguu</i> as ‘a purely formal arrangement or ordering that functions as a mechanism of inclusion
                                       and exclusion’ ([<a href="#R13">13</a>], p.&nbsp;465) on both levels. In the assemblage approach, the main question is ‘given
                                       the specific situation, what kind of assemblage would be required to produce it’ ([<a href="#R13">13</a>], p.&nbsp;473), or as we apply it to our research, the analysis of what produces the <i>Aguu</i> in Gulu today and their labelling as an entity dubbed ‘youth street gang’. This type
                                       of analysis allows us to see beyond the superficial appearance of the <i>Aguu</i> as a street gang, and peer into the deep structures of action ([<a href="#R13">13</a>], p.&nbsp;467).
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e430">As DeLanda ([<a href="#R12">12</a>], p.&nbsp;21) indicates, ‘assemblages emerge from the interaction between their parts,
                                       but once an assemblage is in place, it starts acting as a source of limitations and
                                       opportunities for its components’. These are described as processes of <i>territorialisation/de-territorialisation</i>. Territorialisation in assemblages refers to the processes through which the components
                                       of an assemblage are homogenised, or are drawn from a ‘homogeneous repertoire’, but
                                       may also refer to the spatial boundaries of the whole ([<a href="#R12">12</a>], p.&nbsp;22). Deluze and Guattari [<a href="#R10">10</a>] assert that these processes are anchored in the natural desire of individuals to
                                       ‘become’, and their ability to imagine a future based on that desire, especially in
                                       relation to achieving ontological security ([<a href="#R20">20</a>], pp.&nbsp;1006-1007). When applied to social groups, territorialising includes consolidation
                                       processes encouraging the formation of norms that create clearer demarcation of an
                                       assemblage and increase their capacities ([<a href="#R20">20</a>], p.&nbsp;1009).
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e451">When applied to ‘gang’ research these can be viewed as processes that promote ‘normalisation
                                       and homogeneous meanings, styles, and representation’ ([<a href="#R20">20</a>], p.&nbsp;16). These processes territorialise the ‘gang’ and move it towards becoming
                                       an entity. Territorialisation processes pertaining to an assemblage often lead to
                                       de-territorialisation processes in other assemblages, for example when an individual
                                       person breaks with the norms of one group and begins adhering to norms of another
                                       group. Processes of de-territorialisation can also arise from conflicts between entities,
                                       for example when the police or community engage in efforts to disband (physically
                                       and discursively) groups labelled as ‘criminal gangs’. In such examples the police
                                       and the community move to de-territorialise both the spatial and normative spaces
                                       of the ‘gang’ which are seen to be in tension with the spatial and normative spaces
                                       of other assembled entities ([<a href="#R22">22</a>], p.&nbsp;129).

                                 focus group discussions (FGDs), and participant observation, together with historical

                                 randomly chosen divisions of Gulu municipality [<a href="#R44">44</a>], and one FGD with members of the <i>Aguu</i>. Each FGD comprised of 5-7 participants. In addition, we conducted participant observation
                                 through joining a police patrol in Gulu. Interviews were carried out in English and
                                 Acholi, as one of the authors is a native Acholi speaker.

                                    </h3>
                                    <p id="d1e521">It is difficult to establish with certainty when the term <i>Aguu</i> was coined. The birth of youth languages, such as the <i>Leb pa Bwulu</i> is usually attributed to identity construction [<a href="#R45">45</a>]. In the case of the <i>Aguu</i> as the original practitioners of the <i>Leb pa Bwulu</i>, the birth of the language seems to be related to ‘resistance identity’ [<a href="#R46">46</a>] born out of social exclusion usually associated with stigmatised groups [<a href="#R45">45</a>]. According to Beall et al. ([<a href="#R47">47</a>], p.&nbsp;3072), the processes that lead to the establishment of resistance identities
                                       often occur in cities that become ‘the eye of the storm’ due to conflict. Such processes
                                       often occur as consequences of civil wars turning into civic conflicts which arise
                                       from ‘sense of powerlessness among certain urban groups’ and the attempts they engage
                                       in to reclaim an identity ([<a href="#R47">47</a>], p.&nbsp;3072). The origins of the <i>Aguu</i> (term and group) are directly linked to the civil conflict that devastated Northern
                                       Uganda between 1986-2006. The course and implications of the conflict, as well as
                                       the response of the international community and subsequent intended and unintended
                                       impacts of this response are well documented [<a href="#R48">48</a>, <a href="#R49">49</a>, <a href="#R50">50</a>, <a href="#R51">51</a>, <a href="#R52">52</a>]. These accounts serve as a background to the inception of the <i>Aguu</i>. They reveal how the conflict led to a transformation of Gulu from a small provincial
                                       town to a main hub during both the war and post-war displacement and re-construction
                                       processes [<a href="#R49">49</a>], filling the streets with tens of thousands of displaced Acholi, eventually leading
                                       to a socio-cultural crisis whose effects are still unfolding in present contexts.
                                       In his article on Gulu as a town/camp, Branch [<a href="#R49">49</a>] describes how the transformation of Gulu links to the conditions and processes faced
                                       by the displaced population since 1986. He highlights how the nexus between conflict,
                                       displacement, and international aid efforts impact the foundations of Acholi culture
                                       as well as lead to the growth and transformation of Gulu from a small regional urban
                                       centre into a main hub (and eventually a city in present day). If we place the formation
                                       and later transformation of the <i>Aguu</i> in relationship to this story, as we do below, then the <i>Aguu</i> can be described as a group assembled and transformed through the interaction between
                                       the processes of conflict, displacement, aid, reconstruction, and opportunity.

                                    <p id="d1e586">Throughout the civil war in Northern Uganda, the Acholi population have been subjected
                                       to civilian control strategies exercised by both the LRA and the UPDF [<a href="#R51">51</a>]. As the LRA conducted massive attacks against the civilian population, engaged in
                                       systematic abduction of women and children, and issued decrees banning movement and
                                       forcing the abandonment of settlements [<a href="#R52">52</a>], large portions of the population sought refuge in the relative safety of the streets
                                       of Gulu [<a href="#R49">49</a>]. The UPDF aggravated population displacement by launching systematic attacks on
                                       villages suspected of hosting and collaborating with LRA rebels. This general insecurity
                                       peaked in 1995-96 with a series of LRA abductions and massacres. During this period,
                                       people were forced to leave their lands and homesteads at night and seek refuge in
                                       the streets of Gulu and other places [<a href="#R51">51</a>]. In October 1996, the government of Uganda introduced the ‘Protected Villages’ policy,
                                       which forced the local population to leave their villages on a forty-eight hours’
                                       notice and gather in a number of camps where the UPDF had increased military presence
                                       [<a href="#R53">53</a>] ([<a href="#R54">54</a>], p.&nbsp;92). Through this process, Gulu town was transformed overnight to the largest
                                       camp in the region [<a href="#R49">49</a>]. This wartime displacement brought into the streets of Gulu a large and diverse
                                       population who lost their access to livelihood. It also brought into Gulu a humanitarian
                                       economy, creating important new opportunities for the displaced, sustaining the needs
                                       of most people in town [<a href="#R49">49</a>]. These circumstances carried a significant number of people into the streets of
                                       Gulu and exposed them to a changing urban environment, while detaching them from their
                                       habitual rural livelihoods. But it was mostly the post-war effects of this massive
                                       displacement that led to the current fault lines in Acholi society. These fault lines
                                       are results of disruptions caused by the war to land tenure systems and property disputes
                                       [<a href="#R55">55</a>, <a href="#R56">56</a>], education and disconnection of individuals from culture and community lives [<a href="#R7">7</a>, <a href="#R57">57</a>] family breakdown and orphanage [<a href="#R58">58</a>], experiencing urban/westernised lifestyles and ‘corporate culture’ ([<a href="#R7">7</a>], p.&nbsp;92) [<a href="#R49">49</a>], massive NGO intervention and a humanitarian economy [<a href="#R59">59</a>], dependency syndrome [<a href="#R60">60</a>, <a href="#R61">61</a>, <a href="#R62">62</a>], and changes to ‘traditional’/cultural institutions [<a href="#R7">7</a>].
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e651">As thoroughly discussed by Atkinson [<a href="#R63">63</a>], the Acholi are structured around social institutions including several conventions,
                                       norms and previously sanctioned rules around family, community, livelihood strategies,
                                       household dynamics, culture, rituals etc. In addition, the Acholi society is established
                                       within the sovereign Ugandan State, and as such they incorporate into their ethnic
                                       institutions the institutions of the state, including education, law and order, political
                                       structures etc. The history of Uganda, the civil war, and the subsequent effects of
                                       the massive displacement, violence and trauma, breakdown of habitual livelihood structures,
                                       of households, of communities, of culture, and of the state institutions, led to a
                                       fundamental modification to the traditional Acholi socio-cultural structures ([<a href="#R7">7</a>], pp.&nbsp;314-325). Nevertheless, the Acholi have proven to be resilient, and in the
                                       years since the end of the conflict, they have re-established their communities, socio-cultural
                                       institutions, and organisation [<a href="#R64">64</a>], and reintegrated into the governance structures of the Ugandan State. But some,
                                       as the <i>Aguu</i>, have not been fully re-integrated into society through these processes. In the case
                                       of the <i>Aguu</i>, the transformations that occurred during- and as a consequence of -the conflict,
                                       translated into the formation of an entity after the war, which is viewed today by
                                       the Acholi community, leadership, and state institutions in Gulu, over a decade after
                                       the war has ended, as a disruptive group. Parts of this group today are associated
                                       with distinct emergent institutions such as rules, leadership and (street) language,
                                       and members of this group are engaged in a variety of livelihood strategies, many
                                       of which defy traditional and state institutions. The original group of <i>Aguu</i> emerged from transformations that are directly linked to the disruption caused by
                                       the war to community lives, and the disconnection of some youth/children from their
                                       nucleus families and responsible care of adults, sources of livelihood and social
                                       frameworks. But the processes of transformation of the <i>Aguu</i> are also linked to new opportunities emerging from these circumstances such as the
                                       transformation of Gulu into a major hub, and a variety of subsequent prospects available
                                       in the emerging urban environment. The original <i>Aguu</i>, as we describe below, were children and youth exposed to various degrees of trauma,
                                       loss, and stigmatisation. Their experiences exposed them to changing urban settings,
                                       where they found themselves alone in the streets without direct means of livelihood,
                                       and at the mercy of the humanitarian economy established by a large number of domestic
                                       and foreign NGOs [<a href="#R59">59</a>]. These conflict-related processes of disconnection from conventional social constructions
                                       and exposure to new physical, cultural, and economic environments is at the foundation
                                       of the formation of the original group of <i>Aguu</i>. To better understand these dynamics, we outline below the historical origin of street
                                       youth/children labelled <i>Aguu</i> in Gulu, and then move to describe the present-day context.

                              <p id="d1e693">There are two origins for the initial groups of street youth/children dubbed <i>Aguu</i> in Gulu. The first set of street youth/children came from families who lost access
                                 to their lands, uprooted from their communities, separated from their livelihoods
                                 due to the conflict, and the ‘night commuters’ who trekked to camps to seek relative
                                 safety and protection from LRA attacks and abductions at night [<a href="#R65">65</a>, <a href="#R66">66</a>]. An additional consequence of this mass displacement was numerous births of children
                                 in IDP camps. Some of these children were orphaned due to the war or sickness of their
                                 caregivers; others were abandoned by their parents due to early pregnancies and their
                                 inability to provide for their children, as well as stigmatisation against single
                                 and young mothers. As a result, many of these children who did not know their parents
                                 and had no strong cultural/clan identity, found themselves outside the traditional
                                 Acholi social institutions. The second set of street children who found themselves
                                 rootless in the streets of Gulu are the former abductees. According to estimates,
                                 the LRA abducted between 54,000 and 75,000 people, out of which 25,000 to 38,000 were
                                 children [<a href="#R67">67</a>]. These children were exposed to a variety of traumatic circumstances during the
                                 war, including separation from their homes, safety, abuse, physical and sexual violence.
                                 These children were stigmatised and often punished as collaborators by their communities
                                 when they escaped from the LRA or returned after the war [<a href="#R49">49</a>]. The origination of the street language <i>Leb pa Bwulu</i> as well as the emergence of the term <i>Aguu</i> as a self-designation used by these youth/children to refer to themselves as individuals
                                 who belong to a group who would do anything to get by, is attributed to these initial
                                 groups of youth/children.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e717">In the years that passed since the conflict subsided in 2006, most of the street children/youth
                                 associated with the IDP camps and LRA abductions are now teenagers or young adults.
                                 Nevertheless, the <i>Aguu</i> as a group is still present in the streets of Gulu, which begs the question – who
                                 are the <i>Aguu</i> today? The following section attempts to answer this question based on a series of
                                 interviews, participant observation and focus group discussions conducted with current
                                 and former members of the <i>Aguu</i> in Gulu, street youth, local leaders, police officials, and the community.

                              </h4>
                              <p id="d1e734">When you ask people in Gulu today what is <i>Aguu</i>, one of the most common answers is ‘useless’ children and youth. For most people,
                                 <i>Aguu</i> is used as a derogatory term to designate ‘good for nothing’ troublemaking youth
                                 that lives in and off the streets, as well as a reference to youth criminals and prostitutes
                                 perceived as the main reason for the high crime rates in Gulu. To better observe the
                                 variety of issues on the streets of Gulu, we joined a night-time police foot patrol.
                                 The patrol departed from Gulu police station at 8:00 pm and lasted about six hours.
                                 We joined a team of three armed and uniformed police officers, led by an Assistant
                                 Inspector of Police in civilian clothing accompanied by three local community leaders
                                 at the LC1 level [<a href="#R68">68</a>]. The local community leaders held the position of ‘defence secretaries’, having
                                 the responsibility to ensure local security, assist the local council leader (LC1)
                                 and the police on matters of security, and liaise between the community, the local
                                 council leader and the police on security matters. During the patrol we observed a
                                 large presence of youth and children in the streets of Gulu, including young girls
                                 acting as prostitutes, both in the streets and around lodges. In July 2018, police
                                 officials in Gulu told us that there are about 300 <i>Aguu</i> in the streets. In January 2019, Patrick Jimmy Okema, the Aswa Region Police Spokesperson
                                 was quoted in a news outlet saying that ‘at least 100 children still sleep and eat
                                 off the streets of Gulu town, seven years after peace returned to the region’ [<a href="#R69">69</a>]. Unofficially, a senior police official informed us in January 2020 that there is
                                 a gap between the numbers provided by the police for the ‘consumption of the general
                                 public’ and in reality, the police estimates that there are about 600 <i>Aguu</i> in the streets of Gulu. Below we outline who these <i>Aguu</i> are in the streets of Gulu today as they are described through the lenses of the
                                 different groups of stakeholders.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e758">According to the police, the <i>Aguu</i> is a reference to a criminal gang. They consist of ‘lazy’ youth and children, that
                                 broke with family traditions and live in and off the streets; they are seen as rebellious
                                 youth/children that engage in acts of petty thievery, organised crime and prostitution.
                                 The police associate the leadership of the <i>Aguu</i> today with war-time displaced children and abductees. The <i>Aguu</i> are described by the police as a ‘street gang’ and they often refer to children and
                                 youth labelled <i>Aguu</i> as ‘members’ of a ‘street gang’. A variety of criminal activities are attributed
                                 to the <i>Aguu</i> by the police. These include organised robbery of unsuspecting civilians, prostitution,
                                 house and business break-ins, and various violent criminal activities that often result
                                 in injury or murder of civilians. Police officials often use the term ‘terrorise’
                                 to describe the <i>Aguu</i> impacts on people in Gulu. They are often described by the police as substance abusers
                                 and are accused of committing criminal acts under the influence of alcohol or drugs.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e779">Like the police, community leaders often blame the <i>Aguu</i> for much of the insecurity in the streets of Gulu. The term <i>Aguu</i> is used by community leaders and members of the community as a derogatory term, referring
                                 to youth and children that spend their time in the streets, do not behave according
                                 to socio-cultural norms, cause trouble and commit crime, and as a term that designates
                                 an affiliation with a gang. Several accounts by politicians, the police, community
                                 leaders and the <i>Aguu</i>, indicate that <i>Aguu</i> is also a reference to youth/children recruited by local businessmen and politicians
                                 to commit illegal acts for profit, to intimidate opponents, exert acts of vengeance,
                                 and weaken competition. In these narratives the <i>Aguu</i> are also described as both organised gangs and individuals available for hire.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e796">As indicted by local leaders during interviews, the discourse and subsequent action
                                 by political leaders in Gulu in relation to the <i>Aguu</i> play an important role in popular politics and local power competitions for resources.
                                 This often translates into more than public rhetoric, and transforms into illegal
                                 ‘vigilante’ action led by politicians and local leaders to rid the streets of Gulu
                                 from the <i>Aguu</i>. Many prominent leaders in Gulu ‘earned their stripes’ by leading groups of ‘vigilantes’
                                 armed with clubs, in what could be described as mob violence actions against the Aguu
                                 to ‘fix’ the crime problem in Gulu. The current Mayor of Gulu, George Labeja, built
                                 his reputation and began his political career by leading groups of vigilantes in violent
                                 mob justice actions against ‘petty thievery’ in Gulu. The Mayor often refers to these
                                 actions as part of his political campaign promises to bring security to the streets
                                 of Gulu [<a href="#R70">70</a>, <a href="#R71">71</a>, <a href="#R72">72</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e813">In recent years other political leaders have mobilised groups of people in violent
                                 civilian actions against the <i>Aguu</i> [<a href="#R73">73</a>]. These politicians describe the <i>Aguu</i> as ‘groups of organised criminals’, ‘petty thieves’ and a ‘major source of insecurity
                                 in Gulu town’. Such vigilante actions and episodes often result in mob violence that
                                 lead to death and injury on both sides, as well as cycles of reprisal actions [<a href="#R70">70</a>, <a href="#R71">71</a>, <a href="#R72">72</a>]. In April 2019, an LC1 chairperson from Layibi division in Gulu mobilised 40 people
                                 armed with clubs and other improvised weapons against the <i>Aguu</i> who were accused of plural break-ins, arson, and robbery in the area. This violent
                                 episode led to a reprisal action by the <i>Aguu</i>, prompting a joint police and army intervention which included firing live rounds
                                 at the <i>Aguu</i> [<a href="#R74">74</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e846">Some murders of public servants in Gulu are often initially attributed to the <i>Aguu</i>, but without concrete evidence, such as the murders of Gulu Municipal Deputy Town
                                 Clerk John Oola in May 2017, former Gulu University lecturer Andrew Rachkara in June
                                 2014, as well as several media personalities. In interviews with police officials
                                 and local leaders, the respondents indicated that some of the reasons for the initial
                                 attributions of crimes to the <i>Aguu</i> include: using the <i>Aguu</i> to deviate attention from a political or economic motive for the crime; for political
                                 reasons; and because the <i>Aguu</i> are often actually hired to conduct such actions by politicians, businessmen and
                                 ordinary people.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e860">In general, community members refer to the <i>Aguu</i> as ‘criminals’ and ‘pests’. They see them as youth/children who ‘rebelled’ against
                                 tradition and culture, broke away from family structures and values, and chose livelihood
                                 strategies and lifestyles which are not accepted by Acholi society. Street children/youth
                                 today bear the same stigma stamped upon the original group of street children/youth
                                 associated with the conflict.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e865">Members of the community often explain the lifestyle of the <i>Aguu</i> in relation to substance abuse. As explained by the police, politicians, and as we
                                 observed during our night-time patrol with the police, alcohol, opium and cannabis
                                 consumption are concrete problems in Gulu. Both the community and the police use circular
                                 arguments to explain crime and presence of children/youth in the streets in relation
                                 to substance abuse. Some explain that street children/youth commit crime because they
                                 are under the influence of drugs (so being under the influence is the reason for unruly
                                 behaviour); on the other hand, others explain that children/youth commit crime because
                                 they need money for drugs and alcohol (so addiction is the motivation for crime).
                                 But most respondents also connect the presence of children/youth in the streets of
                                 Gulu, and subsequent criminal activity for survival, to boredom, to the conflict,
                                 and to the outcomes of the conflict. They link the existence of the <i>Aguu</i> and part of their leadership today to the original groups of street children/youth
                                 in Gulu. And they also link the presence of street children/youth who were not directly
                                 displaced by the conflict or abducted by the LRA to the outcome of the conflict in
                                 a variety of ways: some street children/youth are in the streets today because their
                                 parents were affected by the conflict in terms of disruptions of livelihood, inaccessibility
                                 to land and property, mental sickness etc. and therefore the children/youth had to
                                 leave or flee their houses and families. Another explanation is that street children/youth
                                 today were ‘exposed’ to external influence through the humanitarian economy that persisted
                                 in Gulu for almost a decade after the conflict ended (foreigners, NGOs, westerners),
                                 and therefore choose to try and pursue an urban lifestyle which is not consistent
                                 with Acholi values and/or inspired by foreign influence and imagined opportunities.
                                 But they also recognise that some children/youth freely choose the street life for
                                 freedom and access to what they believe is ‘easy money’ through a life of crime. In
                                 all the examples given to us above, members of the community, police and local leadership
                                 see the <i>Aguu</i> today as deviants. Almost no respondents viewed the <i>Aguu</i> as victims or with compassion [<a href="#R75">75</a>].

                              </h4>
                              <p id="d1e888">Interviews with contemporary street youth indicate that unlike the original <i>Aguu</i>, not everyone who is labelled as such today is homeless, orphan, rootless, or lives
                                 permanently in the streets. In addition, and as expected more than a decade after
                                 the end of the civil war, the data below indicates that the presence of many street
                                 children/youth in Gulu today is unrelated or not directly related to the conflict
                                 in the same way as the original group was.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e893">It is difficult to determine with certainty how many children/youth live permanently
                                 in the streets of Gulu today. But the fact that some of those who label themselves
                                 or are labelled by others as <i>Aguu</i> are not homeless or street children/youth, indicates that the term has clearly transformed
                                 from a description of a specific group linked to the conflict and its outcomes, to
                                 denote youth and children that live in and off the streets, and include youth and
                                 children that are not necessarily homeless, as well as youth and children that conduct
                                 criminal activities and exhibit behaviours that are not considered normative such
                                 as break-away from their communities, families, abuse substances, and engage in prostitution.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e898">As indicated in the previous section, various stakeholders have firm opinions about
                                 the identity of the <i>Aguu</i> as deviants, but in reality, <i>Aguu</i> is a diverse group. In the following section we describe the nuanced identities of
                                 street youth based on various self-descriptions collected through interviews and FGDs
                                 with male and female respondents. We outline how they themselves view the various
                                 reasons behind why certain youth and children end up in the streets today. We then
                                 turn to outline the organisation, leadership, activities, coordination of the street
                                 youth/children that engage in organised criminal activities, as well as collusion
                                 between such groups, labelled <i>Aguu</i> ‘gangs’ and stakeholders in Gulu as described by members of these groups during interviews.

                              <p id="d1e909">Firstly, it is important to recall that the term <i>Aguu</i> was coined by street children/youth as a self-reference. While it is used today as
                                 a derogatory reference to street youth/children, it is still used by many street youth/children
                                 as a self-reference despite the negative external connotations, a point we come back
                                 to in the analysis below. When we asked street youth why they end up in the streets
                                 of Gulu today, several underlying explanations emerge from stories told in interviews:

                                          they do not get along with their caregivers and are chased away from the household.
                                          Some have lost their biological parents during the war and were sent to relatives,
                                          who themselves have many children. In some cases, when relatives do not have the means
                                          to take care of everyone, some youth/children are forced- or choose -to, leave because

                                 Acholi and come from afar to seek work and new opportunities. This is often the case
                                 with female prostitutes that travel to Gulu which is one of the fasted growing urban
                                 centres in Uganda, and the biggest Urban centre in Northern Uganda. These are also
                                 labelled <i>Aguu</i>.

                              <p id="d1e959">For many street youth/children, crime and prostitution are livelihood strategies.
                                 The processes that lead to the changes of <i>Aguu</i> from homeless and rootless youth and children linked to the conflict who would do
                                 anything to get by, to loosely organised criminal gangs is intimately linked to economic,
                                 political and social opportunism of both the street youth/children and other stakeholders
                                 in Gulu that contribute to the onset of criminal organisation. Some of our respondents
                                 indicate that the organisation of some youth/children beyond opportunistic petty thievery
                                 into organised criminal gangs is linked to sponsorship of predatory stakeholders such
                                 as scrap dealers, local businessmen, vendors from Kampala, politicians, and others.
                                 This narrative was also repeated by local government officials and the police interviewed
                                 during this research. According to accounts collected from street youth/children and
                                 local leaders in Gulu, the organised criminal endeavours of the <i>Aguu</i> began when local scrap dealers solicited street youth/children in Gulu to locate
                                 material, steal and bring it back to scrap yards where they would receive a small
                                 payment for their service. Some scrap dealers, especially dealers who came from other
                                 locations in Uganda, were not familiar with Gulu town and the <i>Aguu</i> serve as their local eyes and hands to gather scrap and other valuable items to be
                                 sold by the scrap dealers for a profit. Other local businessmen, such as mobile phone
                                 vendors and lodge owners are also using <i>Aguu</i> to turn a profit. Some mobile phone vendors for example, pay <i>Aguu</i> to steal phones, and then sell them for a profit in their shops. Lodge owners essentially
                                 use female <i>Aguu</i> prostitutes by allowing them to bring clients to the lodge and rent out rooms at
                                 hourly rates. These activities led to several levels of organisation among street
                                 youth/children in Gulu, which in turn led to the formation and organisation of groups,
                                 including a system of leadership and rules as described below.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e980">The organisation of several groups of street youth and children in Gulu to carry out
                                 coordinated activities, has led to increased sophistication and collusion with various
                                 opportunistic sponsors. These operations involve coordination with boda-boda drivers
                                 who provide transportation services; they involve <i>Aguu</i> prostitutes who provide intelligence or help lure victims to be robbed by the group;
                                 and coordination between groups in town and their leadership for organisation, seeking
                                 permission to conduct activities across territories, and collection of information
                                 to be shared between groups. The <i>Aguu</i> also report that in many cases, break-ins, arson, beating, and sometimes murder are
                                 carried by contracts they receive from local businessmen, other members of the community,
                                 politicians, and external stakeholders from outside the city of Gulu. Sometimes the
                                 <i>Aguu</i> coordinate activities with individual members of the police through bribery to ensure
                                 slow or lack of police interference or minimal investigation.

                              <p id="d1e991">When it comes to the leadership and organisation, information collected during interviews
                                 indicate that the <i>Aguu</i> cannot be considered as a single organised criminal group with unified leadership.
                                 There are several organised groups which act as more or less coherent street criminal
                                 gangs, each with their own leadership structure and set of rules. While <i>Aguu</i> criminal groups often communicate and coordinate between themselves (see below),
                                 there are no regular ‘leadership’ meetings nor an overarching leadership structure.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e999">Street children/youth are organised in various territorial settings. These range from
                                 groups who claim territoriality based on streets or areas they live in, or around
                                 localities such as industrial areas, pubs and lodges. The <i>Aguu</i> often give nicknames to their territory/group (See Table <a href="#Tab1">1</a>). The police and members of the community at large often view the <i>Aguu</i> as ‘cells’ operating from localities/areas in Gulu, and in many cases members of
                                 the <i>Aguu</i> criminal groups also refer to themselves as belonging to these cells.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e1014">The <i>Aguu</i> groups vary in size, activities, and level of organisation. Each group seems to have
                                 a leadership structure, where at least one member is considered the main ‘go-to’ leader.
                                 Leadership is based on several qualities, including physical strength, experience
                                 in the street, cunningness and most importantly, his or her network. A leader needs
                                 to be able to coordinate with other groups and their leaders, with the local community,
                                 businessmen, police, politicians, and other stakeholders in order to benefit and protect
                                 members of the group. The leaders command respect in the street. They must be able
                                 to protect and rescue members of their group if the need arises. Members of the groups
                                 follow their instructions.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e1019">Many indicated that the members of the criminal <i>Aguu</i> groups do not use real names, and especially do not call their leaders by names.
                                 There are many nicknames and titles for various leaders and members. Table <a href="#Tab2">2</a>. presents some examples of nicknames given to leaders and lower ranking members of
                                 <i>Aguu</i> criminal groups. Sponsors of the <i>Aguu</i> criminal groups are referred to as ‘dons’ and are those who buy valuables or contract
                                 the groups for various purposes.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e1033">Members of the <i>Aguu</i> criminal groups follow a loose set of rules that seem to be designed first and foremost
                                 to regulate behaviour between the members, between the members and their leaders,
                                 and instruct members on how to behave if they are caught. The existence of rules,
                                 as well as their formulation as outlined below, is a clear indication of organisation
                                 and coordination. If rules are broken there are several prescribed consequences. Sanctions
                                 against violators vary, but respondents report that they may range from corporal punishment
                                 to banishment in extreme cases. Table <a href="#Tab3">3</a> presents some of the different rules and sanctions that various <i>Aguu</i> criminal group members must follow.

                              <p id="d1e1260">Many of the females labelled <i>Aguu</i> are engaged in organised prostitution. Prostitutes are mostly organised around local
                                 lodges in Gulu, but are also organised as groups in the streets. While the owners
                                 of the lodges do not govern the female prostitutes, it is the owner who supervises
                                 the affairs of the lodge and the female Aguu leader. The owner communicates with a
                                 ‘head lady’ who is considered the leader of the <i>Aguu</i> prostitutes operating from a lodge. The ‘head lady’ is usually a prostitute herself
                                 but takes control of most decisions and planning of daily activities. In cases where
                                 the girls live together as a group or in the same household, then the ‘head lady’
                                 collects contributions for food from the other prostitutes daily, as well as rent
                                 and other utilities on a monthly basis. The ‘head lady’ enforces the rules of the
                                 lodge and the rules of behaviour for the girls (see below). There is usually a connection
                                 between the Aguu prostitutes, the ‘head lady’, and a male <i>Aguu</i> criminal group leader who is responsible for a group in the area. The male <i>Aguu</i> leader and the ‘head lady’ meet to discuss security issues, coordination with NGOs
                                 and other organisation that provide contraceptive and other health services, as well
                                 as coordination of other criminal activities where prostitution is involved such as
                                 luring victims and other involvement in planning and implementation of criminal activities.
                                 Female <i>Aguu</i> also follow sets of rules and are sanctioned in various ways if rules are broken
                                 (Table <a href="#Tab4">4</a>.)

                                 Many find a variety of temporary work opportunities available in the streets, such

                              <p id="d1e1385">In every society one can locate discourses alluding to past times when culture and
                                 society thrived, and great things were accomplished. In post-war ‘Acohliland’ these
                                 discourses are rather prominent, celebrating a notion of a pre-1986 past where ‘traditional
                                 institutions’, ‘culture’, and ‘family values’ were respected as the pillars of society.
                                 There is no doubt that the war has had a deep impact on Acholi societal institutions
                                 and has led to several fault lines within that society. In Gulu, the onset of the
                                 processes of change that contributed to the inception of the <i>Aguu</i> as an entity, are linked to the civil war and the circumstances which led to an unusual
                                 number of youth/children in the streets of Gulu, disconnected from the habitual environment
                                 and social institutions. In parallel, international efforts to assist the civilian
                                 population affected by the war coupled with the massive displacement of population,
                                 led to both the physical growth and the introduction of new livelihood opportunities
                                 in Gulu. It is not surprising that in the years since the war ended, these circumstances
                                 accelerated tensions between forces of continuity and forces of change in Acholi society
                                 and the state. As summarised by Vorhölter ([<a href="#R7">7</a>], p.&nbsp;272), the societal and cultural principles that structured the pre-war Acholi
                                 society have been disturbed by the war, but they have also ‘been challenged by women
                                 and youth, who took over new roles during and after the war’. In addition, the proliferation
                                 of ‘western’ ideas through the heavy involvement of NGOs and the international community
                                 during and after the war through development aid, relief, and reconstructions efforts,
                                 contributed to internal criticism within the Acholi society that ‘have called into
                                 question established local belief and value systems’ ([<a href="#R7">7</a>], p.&nbsp;272). It is not unexpected that many community and cultural leaders in Gulu
                                 speak about Acholi society using narratives that highlight change and loss as a threat
                                 to traditional values, and the need to continue rebuilding, strengthening and persevering
                                 traditional institutions. In these narratives, street youth/children and their current
                                 behaviours and attitudes are flagged as a major source of insecurity, undermining
                                 both what is seen by many as traditional Acholi values, and as an obstacle to the
                                 reconstruction of a society that adhere to those institutions [<a href="#R76">76</a>]. These tensions coupled with the history of the <i>Aguu</i> and contemporary criminal activities and organisation of some street youth/children,
                                 led to labelling of the <i>Aguu</i> as a deviant and disturbing entity by members of the community, the police, and local
                                 leaders. Viewing groups such as the <i>Aguu</i> as deviants is not uncommon from criminological perspectives (but also not uncontested
                                 within the same discipline). This point of view is expressed from a particular understanding
                                 of how society should be in a context by those who have the power to define and sanction,
                                 and subsequently lead to explanations of why some members of that society ‘deviate’
                                 from this ‘mainstream’ view. As we explained above, the <i>Aguu</i> are viewed as such a deviant group by the police (a law-and-order institution concerned
                                 with enforcing the common law of the state of Uganda, tasked with crime reduction),
                                 local leaders and members of the community (who mainly view their society through
                                 a mixture of their cultural institution, state institutions, the context of the civil-war,
                                 and a variety of interests that collide/align with the existence of <i>Aguu</i>, including economic, power, and cultural motives), and within the context of changing
                                 urban settings/growth of Gulu. From a theoretical perspective, these entities view
                                 the <i>Aguu</i> through a lens of <i>Anomie</i>: the breakdown of norms [<a href="#R77">77</a>]. Through this lens, transitions in societies are often viewed as leading to a crisis
                                 of norms for some, caused by the shift/loss of long standing and familiar social institutions,
                                 especially when conflict is involved. When this disjunction occurs in societies, many
                                 individuals enter a transition period where they find themselves in a state of confusion
                                 and disorganisation caused by break down of norms brought about by the loss of their
                                 social anchors [<a href="#R78">78</a>]. Based on this concept, the Strain Theory of Deviance was developed in criminology
                                 [<a href="#R79">79</a>] linking the breakdown of norms to the adoption (by some in society) of nonstandard
                                 approaches to life, such as crime, to achieve status and goals in society. Viewed
                                 through this lens, the formation of gangs and their criminal activities are often
                                 explained as deviant subcultures [<a href="#R80">80</a>] arguing that while groups as such diverge from accepted social norms, they also
                                 create a different sets of norms they develop, and a subculture is formed. This lens
                                 is consistent with the predominant view of the <i>Aguu</i> in Gulu as an ‘entity’ by the police, local leaders, and the community, in an assemblage
                                 where these entities are interacting in the space of Gulu city. The context presented
                                 here is linked to conflict, post conflict re-construction, growth of the urban space,
                                 changing contexts (institutional, cultural, economic etc.) and new opportunities available
                                 for everyone. The <i>Aguu</i> and the organisation of criminal groups within them, are viewed by the police, local
                                 leaders, and the community as a force of change that collides with predominant views
                                 about continuity of specific socio-cultural and state institutions. On the other hand,
                                 some of the same individuals who label the <i>Aguu</i> as deviants, see them as an opportunity to achieve political, economic or other objectives.
                                 These views of the <i>Aguu</i> as opportunity leads to two main categories of interaction with them. On the one
                                 hand the <i>Aguu</i> feature in discourses as a source of insecurity in Gulu by those who have an interest
                                 of using the <i>Aguu</i> for purposes of political or economic gains to increase personal or other status.
                                 This also leads at times to concrete measures against the <i>Aguu</i>, such as the ‘vigilante’ acts we describe. On the other hand, various individuals
                                 within the police, local leadership and the community, use their various powers to
                                 co-opt the <i>Aguu</i> and utilise them for economic gain, as labour, removing economic and political competition,
                                 and sorting personal and civic disagreements through violence. Some of these interactions
                                 with the <i>Aguu</i> can be analysed from an assemblage perspective as efforts to de-territorialise the
                                 group, for example by criminalising the ‘entity’ and taking actions against them.
                                 Other interactions lead to increased territorialisation of the <i>Aguu</i>, for example by mobilising them to achieve economic, political, and civic interests
                                 which results in strengthening the organisation and opportunities available to street
                                 youth/children. Thus, perceptions of the <i>Aguu</i> go beyond the dissatisfaction of an older generation with the choices of youth in
                                 the post-war era; the <i>Aguu</i> are simultaneously viewed as a source of insecurity due to crime and rebellious social
                                 behaviours, but also used by the same groups who label them as unwanted deviants to
                                 turn profit, to secure interests and for political gain.

                              <p id="d1e1472">In a place where the civil-war is still present in the minds of the population as
                                 a cause of contemporary disruption to societal norms, structures and livelihoods,
                                 some of the discourses in relation to the <i>Aguu</i> equates them to a dangerous ‘rebel group’ that pose security threats to the population
                                 and the city of Gulu [<a href="#R81">81</a>, <a href="#R82">82</a>, <a href="#R83">83</a>]. As specified by street youth and various other stakeholders in Gulu, the conflict
                                 is still seen as a significant underlying cause for the presence of <i>Aguu</i> in the streets of Gulu. This is not only in relation to the current leadership of
                                 some <i>Aguu</i> ‘gangs’ of which some indicated that they belonged to the original group of street
                                 youth/children who found themselves in the streets as a direct result of the conflict.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e1493">This is also relevant to youth and children that ended in the streets of Gulu after
                                 the end of the conflict for reasons that are described as insecurities affecting caregivers
                                 stemming from the conflict, including difficult socio-economic situations, lack of
                                 access to livelihood due to loss of land, mental health, and other traumatic effects
                                 etc. The conflict is also the main reason behind the accelerated processes of urbanisation,
                                 growth and change in Gulu [<a href="#R84">84</a>]. These processes, which began with the conflict and continued after the conflict
                                 as part of reconstruction efforts and the presence of a large number of national and
                                 international NGOs’, present new opportunities for people, and attract many youth/children
                                 as well as adults to the streets of Gulu for a variety of reasons.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e1498">As specified above, the <i>Aguu</i> is a reference to a complex entity which is defined externally as a homogenous deviant
                                 group. Internally, however, the <i>Aguu</i> is varied, multiple, complex and fluid. Despite being used as a derogatory term by
                                 most of those who view them as deviants, many street children/youth refer to themselves
                                 as <i>Aguu</i>. Some do so to indicate that they are ‘dangerous’, and as a consequence are left
                                 alone or imagine they gain respect through instilling fear. Others do so to convey
                                 an identity or a sense of belonging to an entity that fulfils some institutional functions
                                 and is composed of individuals that occupy the same physical and societal space.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e1509">In reality, <i>Aguu</i> today is a reference to youth and children that have in common the fact that their
                                 umbilical cords to mainstream societal structures have been severed or damaged, willingly
                                 or unwillingly. While the data illustrates how a history of displacement has led to
                                 the inception of the <i>Aguu</i> in Gulu, the subsequent processes of modification and change of this group represents
                                 more than the outcomes of the conflict, but also shifting generational values in Acholi
                                 society, and a break-down and reformulation of social, cultural, political and economic
                                 interests within the shifting character of urban Gulu after the conflict subsided
                                 and to date.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e1517">When it comes to the criminal organisation of the <i>Aguu</i>, we have outlined some of the <i>territorialisation</i> processes such as physical space, creation of rules, sanction, symbolic language
                                 and leadership. We have also indicated how members of the police, community and local
                                 leadership contribute to these <i>territorialisation</i> processes through, for example, bribery of police officers, co-option of criminal
                                 groups for economic gain, for political gain, and for punishment and revenge purposes,
                                 but also through marginalising and labelling the groups as social deviants, which
                                 leads to the formation of an identity and a counter movement of <i>territorialisation</i>. We have also alluded to the processes that attempt to <i>de-territorialise</i> the <i>Aguu</i>, expressed through police, political and popular actions and rhetoric against street
                                 youth/children. Also mentioned are the processes of <i>de-territorialisation</i> in relation to youth/children breaking away from what is considered normative socio-cultural
                                 Acholi institutions as well as state institutions such as law and order, and <i>re-territorialisation</i> in the form of <i>Aguu</i>, which, despite the external derogatory and criminal meaning, has also internal representation
                                 of identities stemming from access to and availability of new opportunities, hope
                                 for better lives, but also constrained choices, criminal organisation and abusive
                                 livelihood contexts. In this case, the study of the historical trajectory behind the
                                 creation and evolution of the <i>Aguu</i> and the processes that led to the contemporary outcome of their organisation and
                                 presence in the streets of Gulu, becomes an important factor for understanding the
                                 long-term effects of societal disruptions and new emerging opportunities for human
                                 security/insecurity in Gulu.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e1550">Referring to the <i>Aguu</i> today as a criminal entity and in derogatory terms, without distinguishing between
                                 the original <i>Aguu</i>, the multiple identities and activities of street youth/children at large in Gulu,
                                 processes of change in Gulu, the multiple identities and activities of those who use
                                 the <i>Aguu</i> for various purposes etc., leads to treating the <i>Aguu</i> today as an homogenous entity, and subsequently to discourses that point to a surface
                                 that looks deviant and criminal, but in reality overlooks complexity, multiplicity
                                 and fluidity.

                              <p id="d1e1567">This study is focused on the <i>Aguu</i>, their complex history, current complexity, fluidity, change and evolution, and their
                                 place in Gulu. We did not study the <i>Aguu</i> in relation to the history and organisation of other criminal groups in Uganda, urban
                                 spaces, or elsewhere in Africa and the world. This article does not deal with street
                                 youth in African cities as a phenomenon, although our use of Assemblage Theory may
                                 nevertheless be relevant in the study of youth in other African cities to reveal underlying
                                 complex societal processes. Instead, the article focuses on street youth/children
                                 in Gulu linked to the particular context in Northern Uganda, and the shifting external
                                 and internal identities of the group and its members. We focused on fleshing out how
                                 children/youth became/become ‘<i>Aguu</i>’, the meanings of this label, the current organisation of the criminal groups within
                                 the <i>Aguu</i>, how the <i>Aguu</i> are viewed, understood and used by various members of the community, police, and
                                 local leadership, as well as how street children/youth view themselves and their livelihood
                                 contexts. We also highlight how these different identities are integrated into political
                                 and security discourses in Gulu. For ethical reasons and limitations of time and scope,
                                 we did not speak directly with minors, and did not focus on enlarging the number of
                                 respondents but focused instead on key informants and different stakeholders to sample
                                 the main discourses and opinions. We hope that the findings of this research will
                                 enable various stakeholders in Northern Uganda to better understand the identities
                                 of those who are labelled <i>Aguu</i>, the background for their formation as an entity, the mechanisms of transformation,
                                 and the linkage to criminal organisation. As the UPF is determined to roll its Community
                                 Policing Strategy, this article can provide some of the necessary analysis that may
                                 assist in developing more nuanced approaches to street children/youth in Gulu.

                                          Aguu as street youth/children or as criminal gangs in an urban space is a unique phenomenon
                                          in Gulu, Uganda. We allude to the particular trajectory that lead to assemblages and
                                          their multiplicity and fluidity. Indeed, research on street youth/children and criminal
                                          gangs in African cities and elsewhere in the world indicates many similarities between
                                          the criminal behaviour of the Aguu in Gulu and other places in the world, as well
                                          as similar mechanisms of interac- tions in contexts of political economy, post-conflict
                                          reconstruction, urbanisation etc. As we specify in the limitations section of this
                                          article, we do not engage here in a review and summary of this literature, nor conduct
                                          a comparative analysis. Nevertheless, the information in this article can serve those
