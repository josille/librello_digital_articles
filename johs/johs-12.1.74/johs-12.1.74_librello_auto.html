                              <p id="d1e84">Even before the World Cup and Olympic bids were secured, the state government of Rio
                                 de Janeiro began to recraft its image as a safe and glamorous mega-events wonderland.
                                 In order to satisfy the International Olympic Committee, the city focused on overturning
                                 the city's reputation for violence—and violent policing—especially inside its urban
                                 favelas, made up of a assortment of informal and irregular settlements, occupations
                                 of abandoned buildings, and substandard government housing complexes that together
                                 weave a loose fabric over Brazil's second largest mega-city. A “Games Security Plan”,
                                 devised by the state and put into operation by all of Brazil's three government levels
                                 (federal, state and municipal)—was launched as one of the greatest legacies of the
                                 Olympics [<a href="#R01">1</a>]. It was implemented in two divisions: the “Public Security Integrated Regions” for
                                 the <i>asfalto</i> (formal city); and the “Police Pacification Units” (UPP) in the favelas.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e92">Rio's police pacification campaign officially launched in 2008. Since that time, 38
                                 of Rio's 763 favelas have been occupied by a range of Rio's Special Ops troops and
                                 military police including the UPP police, BOPE (Elite Special Operations Batallion
                                 troops), Choque (Shock troops), and CORE (Civilian Police Special Resources police).
                                 To date, 9,543 UPP officers [<a href="#R02">2</a>] have been installed in efforts to `pacify' those favelas in proximity to mega-events
                                 venues and tourist areas throughout the city. With one or two exceptions, all UPPs
                                 are located in areas crucial to the commodification of the city—that is, the hosting
                                 of mega-sporting events, athletes villages, tourist facilities, important traffic
                                 and transportation routes, and Games headquarters (Figure <a href="#Fig01">1</a>).
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e100">The priority of the UPP is to take control of designated favelas that are informally
                                 governed by armed drug gangs and corrupt ex-forces militias. The concept was sold
                                 using terms such as 'community policing' and `sustainable security', and promoted
                                 as being concerned with providing human security [<a href="#R03">3</a>], however pacification relies almost exclusively on traditional military force to
                                 achieve the state's geopolitical goals of controlling territory, people, and resources.
                                 As a result, the people in Rio's favelas are subjected to many forms of politically
                                 engineered violence.

                              <p id="d1e112">As a military offensive, pacification serves multiple ends. It utilizes a range of
                                 police forces to ensure that many of the goals of the government's rapid urbanization
                                 agenda—Rio's greater Olympic Legacy—are met. This urbanization agenda theoretically
                                 encompasses the social component of pacification, that is, to provide favela residents
                                 with the public and social services and infrastructure necessary to elevate their
                                 citizenry rights. However, Rio's pacification has come to be exposed as little more
                                 than the military facilitation of David Harvey's concept of “accumulation by dispossession”
                                 [<a href="#R04">4</a>], justified by the `war on drugs' [<a href="#R05">5</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e120">From the beginning, the pacification policy has been supported by a heavily funded
                                 media campaign. Following the winning of the Olympic bid, Rio's marketing budget underwent
                                 substantial growth. From 2006 to 2009 the municipality’s annual expenditure on advertising,
                                 marketing and media increased from R$100,000 to R$ 800,000.  After Mayor Eduardo Paes
                                 took office in 2009, the marketing budget jumped to R$ 29 million (for 2010), and
                                 by 2015 it had reached a staggering R$127 million [<a href="#R06">6</a>]. Much of it has been used for the marketing of pacification in relation to the Olympics.
                                 However, as the Games draw closer, the appeal of military pacification has worn thin,
                                 and the cracks that have always been present in the policy have widened into gaping
                                 fissures.  The police were responsible for one in five homicides in the city during
                                 2015, and the rates continue to escalate during the final count down to the Olympics.
                                 Not even Rio’s marketing campaign, championed by Brazil's right-wing media conglomerate
                                 [<a href="#R07">7</a>], can keep spinning a positive story.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e128">There are many aspects to pacification, far too great for the scope of this paper
                                 to cover [<a href="#R08">8</a>]. Even within the policing framework of pacification, there are too many moving parts
                                 to discuss within this context [<a href="#R09">9</a>]. Therefore, this paper aims to provide a background understanding of pacification
                                 policy in relation to the context of military ‘policing’ and how and why policing
                                 tactics have evolved to play out on the ground as the Games draw near [<a href="#R10">10</a>]. Its intent is to impart a broad understanding of how pacification policy functions
                                 for those living in pacified favelas, and outlines how public security policy and
                                 the Games Plan in general, is affecting the city as a whole.

                                 in favelas, and how other military deployments are being positioned so that they can
                                 be deployed more broadly across the city for the Olympics. It discusses what impact
                                 these operations are having on favela residents and their right to the city, particularly
                                 as it relates to their personal security. In this context, the residents' right to
                                 the city is determined not only by the right to access to public space and resources,
                                 but freedom of mobility, and the collective right to be involved in how their favela
                                 neighborhoods are being shaped through policing.

                              <p id="d1e144">This paper begins by providing a brief historical context that lays the groundwork
                                 for examining the city's pacification framework and urbanization-related public security
                                 initiatives connected to the 2016 Olympic Games. It then examines how the police are
                                 operating on the ground inside the favelas and outlines issues of militarization and
                                 police violence and how this ties to Olympic urbanization activities and a political
                                 and judicial framework that serves Rio's elite public officials and large private
                                 interest groups.  It explores the socio-economic cost of the Olympic fallout, and
                                 lastly offers policy considerations for understanding the difficulties in limiting
                                 Rio's political landscape of corruption and violence.

                              <p id="d1e146">The information has been derived from qualitative fieldwork conducted by the author
                                 in five of Rio's north and south zone favelas and favela complexes between the years
                                 2010 and 2016. It tries to describe key dimensions that have impacted on pacification
                                 policing policy and procedures undertaken to effect public security conditions inside
                                 favelas. These conditions are subject to rapidly-evolving sets of precarious and fragile
                                 policy variables that render it impossible to measure the real-time impact of public
                                 security policy as it plays out in the lives of everyday people during the Olympic
                                 Games. Its aim is, therefore, to provide a general overview of how pacification operates,
                                 how it is linked to urbanization activities, how residents are being affected within
                                 the pacification scenario, and how the city has been affected by the Olympics, and
                                 the policing and criminal justice policies that surround it.

                                 that has been cross-analyzed against a range of empirical data. Qualitative information
                                 was derived from direct observations, conversations with favela residents, meetings
                                 with citizens' committees and Residents’ Associations, interactions with drug traffickers,
                                 UPP officers, government urbanization workers, and municipal stakeholders. Empirical
                                 research has included an examination of articles of law, statistical data [<a href="#R11">11</a>], municipal and state development plans, architectural design documents, human rights
                                 reports, and mainstream and independent media reportage. Participation in conferences,
                                 meetings, and reviews of literature produced by other researchers [<a href="#R05">5</a>] engaged in analyses of Rio's mega-events and urbanization activities also provide
                                 a foundation with which to check and balance the paper.

                              <p id="d1e159">Rio's favelas began to develop toward the end of the nineteenth century as the country
                                 abolished slavery and transformed from a Portuguese empire into a Republic. As informal
                                 settlements grew, urbanized, and became more heavily populated, residents organized
                                 internally to form associations and create the basic infrastructure that the government
                                 had failed to extend to their communities, such as channels for sewerage, transportation
                                 systems, roads, informal real estate title exchanges, and commercial enterprises.
                                 State [<a href="#R12">12</a>] abandonment, sporadic government-led military police incursions, forced population
                                 removals, and the slow takeover of territory by drug trafficking gangs, however, has
                                 progressively limited residents' access to public security, spatial mobility, social
                                 infrastructure, and earning capacity beyond any kind of subsistence existence [<a href="#R13">13</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e167">Rio has always been characterized by a great divide between wealth and poverty, and
                                 in recent years the income gap has begun to increase even more, making it one of the
                                 most unequal cities in the country [<a href="#R14">14</a>]. The favelas are estimated to house more than 1.4 million people, or 27% of the
                                 city's population [<a href="#R15">15</a>]. 20.7% of the city live in households with a per capita income of less than half
                                 the minimum wage, roughly equivalent to US$ 6 a day [<a href="#R01">1</a>]. Existing on half of that, 9.2% of the population survives on less than a quarter
                                 of the Brazilian minimum wage—earning just US$ 3 a day. In pacified favelas, the poverty
                                 rate is even higher—with a third of the population (34.5%) earning less than US$ 6
                                 per day, and almost 1 in 8 households (12.8%) existing on less than US$ 3 per capita
                                 a day [<a href="#R14">14</a>]. In general, the opportunity to earn a living wage is low at best, and out of reach
                                 for the overwhelming majority.

                              <p id="d1e181">The 1980s brought new power bases, struggles, and economic opportunity to Rio through
                                 the US-led `war on drugs'. The city was transformed into a principal point for the
                                 international transit of cocaine and a large domestic market in itself, and the favelas—where
                                 State presence was never well established—became ideal territories from which drug
                                 trafficking gangs could operate. Over time, the scaling-up of the drug trade (that
                                 before had been limited to local residents dealing small quantities of home-grown
                                 marijuana) to traffic large quantities of cocaine, gradually resulted in absolute
                                 gang control over many of the city's favelas.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e183">As cocaine replaced marijuana at the <i>bocas</i> (drug sales points), drug networks and power relations began to change. A new generation
                                 of heavily armed young foot soldiers governed by “micro-level warlords” [<a href="#R16">16</a>] created a system of governance whereby teenage boys patrolled the streets with everything
                                 from AK-47s to Goliath rocket launchers. These youths bear resemblance to child soldiers
                                 in that they operate within armed factions with military-grade weapons inside a command
                                 structure that controls territory, people, and resources [<a href="#R17">17</a>]. However, they are also interwoven into the fabric of the favelas through familial
                                 ties.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e194">The dangers presented by gang culture, as well as turf battles between any combination
                                 of gangs, police, and militias (gangs of corrupt police and prison guards who operate
                                 as guns-for-hire), have continued to place residents in the crosshairs of armed conflict.
                                 These conflicts closely resemble other global security situations that are formally
                                 defined by International Humanitarian Law as `non-international internal armed conflicts'
                                 [<a href="#R18">18</a>] that, at times (and especially at this current moment) bear a notable resemble to
                                 war zones [<a href="#R01">1</a>, <a href="#R19">19</a>]. In the favelas, the impact of these conflicts is strikingly evident. Almost one
                                 in five people have had a family member fall victim to homicide, and levels of youth
                                 homicide are estimated to be seven times that of the rest of the city [<a href="#R88">88</a>].

                              <p id="d1e208">The drug trade has clearly destroyed autonomous agency and brought much harm to the
                                 favelas. However, the State’s institutionalized culture of extreme police brutality
                                 has also taken a heavy toll on favela residents. Rio’s many notorious police forces
                                 have consistently been criticized for their blatant disregard of human rights. Following
                                 the formation of BOPE in the early 1990s, conflict between the drug gangs and the
                                 police rapidly escalated. BOPE troops were incentivized by policies such as the `Wild
                                 West gratuity', implemented from 1995–1998, which increased a police officer's monthly
                                 salary according to how many 'criminals' an officer killed. The policy was credited
                                 with a drastic spike in the number of extra-judicial killings at the hands of the
                                 police during this era, a trend that increased over the years to reach its height
                                 in 2007 when there were a recorded 1,330 killings across the city at the hands of
                                 Rio's police forces.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e210">At this time, the federal government launched the National Program for Public Security
                                 and Citizenship (Pronasci) to tackle the country's public security problems in preparation
                                 for a series of mega-sporting events, including the Pan American Games (2007), the
                                 FIFA World Cup (2014) and the Olympics (2016). Rio de Janeiro was prioritized as a
                                 funding recipient to receive a large portion of the US$ 2.12 billion pledged to be
                                 invested over a five year period in collaborative actions coordinated by states and
                                 municipalities [<a href="#R01">1</a>, <a href="#R21">21</a>]. The program aimed to carry out a set of interdisciplinary joint crime prevention
                                 operations which were to be designed with the “participation [of] the community” through
                                 programs “aimed at improving public safety” [<a href="#R22">22</a>]. Thus, the military pacification campaign was born.

                              <p id="d1e221">The Pronasci funds allocated to finance the UPP were dramatically strengthened by
                                 the government’s largest private sector partner, the EBX Group, owned by businessman
                                 Eike Batista, who between 2011 and 2013 invested R$ 20 million per year (more than
                                 US$ 25 million in total) in UPP security equipment, vehicles and technologies [<a href="#R02">2</a>]. Batista's financing of the UPP program was almost five times higher than the government
                                 funding allocated to the military pacification units. By the end of 2013, however,
                                 both EBX and Batista's oil conglomerate OGX [<a href="#R23">23</a>] had filed for bankruptcy [<a href="#R24">24</a>], and Batista had become the target of a federal investigation by Brazilian regulators.
                                 Batista's withdrawal from the UPP partnership in 2013, the phasing out of Pronasci
                                 funding around the same time, and Brazil's deteriorating economy, has collectively
                                 dealt the campaign a huge financial blow [<a href="#R25">25</a>]. Yet despite the mounting economic challenges, the campaign—for the time being—continues
                                 to hold.

                                 particular forms of cultural events such as <i>baile funks</i> (funk dance parties); and by imposing curfews.  These orders are enforced by Special
                                 Ops troops and UPP officers who, until March 2016, continued to benefit from a modified
                                 version of the Wild West policy, which has been reinvented, amended and applied under
                                 a different name [<a href="#R31">31</a>]. Up until this time, UPP officers received financial compensation of up to R$ 9,000
                                 (US$ 2,830) annually if they met their 'crime reduction targets' in the favelas [<a href="#R32">32</a>]. This increase augmented an officer's salary by as much as an additional 80%. Approximately
                                 R$ 200 million (US$ 63 million) of the R$ 1.8 billion (US$ 0.57 billion) invested
                                 by the municipality in pacification since 2008 was specifically spent on salary bonuses
                                 for UPP police who met their target goals [<a href="#R33">33</a>]. In April 2013 alone, almost 12,000 of Rio's police officers and public servants
                                 received financial bonuses for meeting their target goals [<a href="#R34">34</a>].

                                 US$ 250—have posed a critical problem in relation to corruption [<a href="#R35">35</a>, <a href="#R36">36</a>] and made police an easy mark for traffickers. Many have been accused of supplementing
                                 their incomes by working with gangs to supply illegal weapons, to run drugs, or to
                                 provide protection [<a href="#R13">13</a>]. Frequently referred to as state-sponsored killing, murder or death squads, pacification

                                 freedom to the residents of favelas [<a href="#R38">38</a>]. Yet the police are regularly charged with taking bribes from traffickers [<a href="#R39">39</a>], of bribing witnesses [<a href="#R40">40</a>], and of other forms of extortion [<a href="#R41">41</a>] and corruption [<a href="#R42">42</a>].

                                 squads. A UN Committee on the Rights of the Child report issued in 2015, voiced alarm
                                 at the lethal violence carried out by the Military Police, the UPP, and BOPE against
                                 children in favelas during Shock Order operations aimed at cleansing the city in relation

                              <p id="d1e369">The UN Committee is deeply disturbed not only by the extraordinarily high number of

                                 but by a range of other violations of children’s rights.  These violations include

                                 forces, particularly in favelas; physical violence against children, including the

                                 claims Brazil ranks 3rd place for child homicides (out of 85 countries analyzed).
                                 In other words, 29 children per day are murdered in Brazil (2013) [<a href="#R44">44</a>]. Alarmingly, a 2010–2012 study by Waiselfisz also reveals that, on average, youth
                                 murders by firearms are 285% higher than for the rest of the population, meaning that
                                 for every four children or teenagers killed by gun violence, only one person from
                                 the rest of the population died the same way [<a href="#R45">45</a>].

                              <p id="d1e382">There is also widespread judicial impunity afforded to the police for their actions.
                                 The state prosecutor's office dismisses 99.2% of incidences of death involving police—even
                                 when evidence directly contradicts the police version of events, points to the use
                                 of excessive force, or is a clear cut case of unlawful killing [<a href="#R46">46</a>]. This makes clear why people living in Rio's favelas are more scared of the police
                                 than they are of either militias or drug trafficking gangs [<a href="#R47">47</a>].

                              <p id="d1e390">Another troubling statistic reveals that during Sérgio Cabral's reign as Rio's governor
                                 (2006-2014), nearly 40,000 people were documented as disappeared or missing (a rise
                                 of 32%) [<a href="#R48">48</a>]. This figure correlates to the drop in homicide rates during the same time period.
                                 And though homicide rates fell in favelas during the initial years of pacification
                                 [<a href="#R27">27</a>, <a href="#R49">49</a>], between 2006–2011 the number of violent non-lethal incidents soared—from 29.4 to
                                 99 per 100,000 inhabitants. By 2014, reported incidences of rape and domestic violence
                                 (previously outlawed under gang rule [<a href="#R50">50</a>]) had tripled under the UPP [<a href="#R27">27</a>, <a href="#R51">51</a>].

                              <p id="d1e411">Outside of the favelas, the story of rising crime was much the same. Between 2012
                                 and 2013, pedestrian robberies surged more than 32%, vehicle thefts rose 46.7%, assaults
                                 on buses jumped 118.4%, and cargo theft soared by 175.6% [<a href="#R52">52</a>]. By the end of 2014, muggings (which have been steadily increasing over the last
                                 decade) were up by more than 42% [<a href="#R53">53</a>].

                              <p id="d1e419">Since 2012, lethal violence has also risen substantially. The city's homicide rate
                                 in Rio's poorer North Zone in neighborhoods such as Baixada Fluminense rose by 28%
                                 between January 2012 and September 2013. In the nearby commuter city of Niterói, homicides
                                 rose by 27% due to criminal gangs relocating after being forced out of pacified favelas
                                 [<a href="#R54">54</a>]. The number of people killed by Rio security forces between 2013 and 2014 spiked
                                 by 40% [<a href="#R55">55</a>], there was a 69% increase in extra-judicial resistance killings by police throughout
                                 the state, and a 77% increase in the city. Overall, homicides in Rio were up more
                                 than 18% statewide for January 2014 [<a href="#R52">52</a>] (compared to the previous year), with a 4.3% rise in the city itself [<a href="#R56">56</a>]. From January through October 2014, 481 people were killed by the military police
                                 in Rio, a hundred more than during the same period for 2013 [<a href="#R46">46</a>]. And between 2013 and 2015, homicides resulting from police intervention in the
                                 state of Rio de Janeiro increased by 54%. To put it a different way, on an annual
                                 basis, the police in Rio have been killing about the same amount of people as do the
                                 entire police forces of the United States [<a href="#R57">57</a>]. Most are poor, between the ages of 15 and 29, and black. Nationwide, 77% of all
                                 homicide victims fall into this demographic [<a href="#R58">58</a>].

                              <p id="d1e443">In addition, pacification has dramatically increased the number of favelas in which
                                 criminal militias operate in—from six in 2004 to 148 in 2014. Militias have now spread
                                 beyond the city to control 195 communities in 23 of the 90 municipalities throughout
                                 the state [<a href="#R59">59</a>]. In January 2015, armed confrontations between militias and traffickers accounted
                                 for 80% of the 130 homicides that took place in Baixada Fluminense [<a href="#R60">60</a>].

                                 of 2015, stray bullets injured 32 people [<a href="#R61">61</a>] and caused five deaths throughout the metropolitan area, including those of women,
                                 young children, and adolescents [<a href="#R62">62</a>]. A 2014 UN paper based on 2009–2013 statistics revealed that Brazil has the second
                                 highest number of stray bullet incidents in Latin America (behind Venezuela) [<a href="#R63">63</a>]. Rio's Security Secretary José Beltrame has attributed the majority of stray bullet
                                 shootings to “bandits' attachment to guns” [<a href="#R62">62</a>] though anthropologist and former BOPE officer Paulo Storani, claims that it is more
                                 likely that a large portion of the stray bullet problem is attributable to the pacification's
                                 displacement of drug traffickers [<a href="#R64">64</a>] to unpacified areas. This leads to attempted territorial takeovers of these areas
                                 which are governed by rival gangs.

                              <p id="d1e473">By 2016, the security situation in Rio's favelas had started to spiral out of control.
                                 According to Amnesty International (AI), during the first quarter of 2016, homicides
                                 resulting from police interventions in the city of Rio de Janeiro increased by 10%
                                 compared to the same period in 2015, by mid-2016 lethal police violence had increased
                                 by almost 80%. In the first three weeks of April alone, at least eleven of the city's
                                 favela residents died in this manner [<a href="#R65">65</a>]. By the end of the month, the number had reached 78 statewide [<a href="#R66">66</a>]. And civilians are not the only casualties. In the first six months of 2016, 71
                                 UPP officers were shot in pacified favelas, thirteen fatally (Figure <a href="#Fig04">4</a>) [<a href="#R67">67</a>].

                                 an untenable security situation, and no doubt some benefits have come from public
                                 security interventions under the UPP. However, the single most positive claim associated
                                 with life under UPP was that residents would be more able to walk around the favelas
                                 more freely without being subject to armed violence [<a href="#R01">1</a>]. Yet, social gathering spaces, whether indoors (for example, cultural venues including
                                 children's theaters) or outdoors (for example, community gardens, parks or football
                                 fields) have become indiscriminate shooting galleries for police. People are not even
                                 safe from being shot while having lunch inside their homes. Military operations have
                                 shut down schools, kindergartens, health clinics, businesses, and access to favelas.
                                 Being involved in protests against the tens of thousands of forced evictions that
                                 have preceded the Games also presents a risk to personal safety. A large majority
                                 of residents now feel unable to move around their neighborhoods without fear of being
                                 shot by police [<a href="#R68">68</a>].

                              <p id="d1e512">Since the announcement of the Olympics in 2009 through to mid-2016, 2,500 people have
                                 been killed by police in Rio [<a href="#R69">69</a>]. Ask a mother in a favela how many children she has, and she's likely to answer,
                                 “I have <i>X</i> number of children, <i>Y</i> are still living”. Although the escalation in police killings cannot be directly
                                 linked to the Olympic preparations, these numbers do connect Rio's public security
                                 forces to an escalation in the use of excessive violent force ahead of the Games.
                                 AI fears that “the risk of increased [rights] violations committed directly as a result
                                 of hosting the Olympic Games is great” and that these violations may occur without
                                 appropriate investigation or prosecution, as has been the case in the past [<a href="#R70">70</a>], especially during mega-events such as the World Cup, when police killed 580 people
                                 in the state of Rio de Janeiro, a 40% increase than in the previous year. The number
                                 in 2015 was even greater—645 dead, most uninvestigated [<a href="#R71">71</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e529">Due to Brazil's economic free fall, Rio's State Security Secretary Beltrame, announced
                                 at the end of the first quarter of 2016 that Rio's R$ 7 billion state security budget
                                 was to be cut by about 35% for the year (a reduction of R$ 18 billion)—effective immediately
                                 [<a href="#R68">68</a>]. As a result, the Games plan to utilize approximately 65,000 police and 20,000 military
                                 troops for Olympic security (the largest security operation in Brazil’s history) [<a href="#R72">72</a>] has been thrown into disarray. The public security forces that were to be commandeered
                                 from other states—now also in crisis—have been significantly reduced [<a href="#R73">73</a>] because of the strain on state coffers, some of which have fallen to as low as US$
                                 10,000 [<a href="#R74">74</a>]. Adding to the crisis, several of Rio's state civil police divisions' salaries have
                                 been withheld since March due to a lack of available funds [<a href="#R75">75</a>]. For the moment, UPP salaries are being continued through a special funding donation
                                 from Rio's State Legislative Assembly (Alerj), however the UPP crime reduction target
                                 bonuses have been discontinued [<a href="#R76">76</a>]. These laws are also expected to contribute to the risk of rights violations.

                              <p id="d1e550">In an effort to stem ongoing public discontent around these issues, an array of bills
                                 and laws have been introduced to crack down on almost any form of freedom of public
                                 expression, especially around mega-events [<a href="#R07">7</a>]. In 2013, just months ahead of the World Cup, the Ministry of Defense issued the
                                 Guarantee of Law and Order (GLO) [<a href="#R77">77</a>]—a set of guidelines allowing wider discretionary use of the military for law and
                                 order operations and to quash public protests without transparency or accountability
                                 monitoring mechanisms. The decree outlined an “operational plan” for “disorder control
                                 in the urban environment”, and included any social movement or opposition to “undermine
                                 public order”. The GLO also aimed to craft the “flow of information to the general
                                 public, especially the media” [<a href="#R07">7</a>].

                              <p id="d1e561">The approval of yet another federal Anti-Terrorism Act (Law Project 2016/2015), passed
                                 this time just months before the Olympics, further criminalized the already strict
                                 legal lockdown on exercising the right of freedom of assembly. The law defines terrorism
                                 as the practice, by one or more people, of sabotage, violence, or potentially violent
                                 acts, “when committed with the goal of causing social or generalized terror, or exposing
                                 people, public patrimony or authority to danger” [<a href="#R78">78</a>]. The deliberately vague language used to define terrorism allows for any form of
                                 social protest to be punished with up to a 30-year prison term. The Act is expected
                                 to result in a further increase in unchecked police violence during the Olympics,
                                 especially those that occur in the favelas.  Rafael Custódio, coordinator of Justiça
                                 da Conectas, states that on the eve of the Games, the government “approved the Project
                                 on an emergency basis, without any discussion with society, [as] an instrument to
                                 criminalize collective protests movements”. Moreover, he claims that “the legacy of
                                 the Olympics for Brazil will be the weakening of [its] democracy” [<a href="#R79">79</a>].

                              <p id="d1e569">Going even further, in May, the Federal Government signed the “General Law of the
                                 Olympics” [<a href="#R80">80</a>] to impose heavier restrictions upon the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly in
                                 Rio. Essentially the new GLO is an even more repressive reissue of the General Law
                                 of the World Cup. AI calls it a failure by Brazilian authorities “to deliver the promised
                                 Olympic legacy of a safe country for all [or] to ensure that law enforcement officials
                                 meet international law and standards on the use of force and firearms” [<a href="#R81">81</a>]. Pacification is part of this framework. They are the enforcers for what social
                                 researchers Brito and Oliveira call “the transformation of Rio de Janeiro into a large
                                 tropical theme park” [<a href="#R82">82</a>].

                              <p id="d1e580">Military police are on the frontlines of the violent and forced evictions that have
                                 driven at least 67,000 favela residents from their homes [<a href="#R83">83</a>] all over the city to make way for Olympic facilities, transit routes, and tourist
                                 sites. The police execution of Shock Orders, which shut down informal businesses [<a href="#R84">84</a>], typically follow, further undermining the already low chances that the city's poorer
                                 residents have of achieving socio-economic stability [<a href="#R85">85</a>]. None of this comes as a surprise. As David Zirin has made clear, “so much of the
                                 Olympics historically has been about displacement and the repossession of land for
                                 the wealthy at the expense of the poor” [<a href="#R86">86</a>].

                              <p id="d1e594">José Roberto Bassul asserts that in Brazil, State resources and investments have always
                                 benefited the private sector by adopting urban planning regulations that privilege
                                 Brazil's real estate and construction sector giants, and moreover, that urbanism has
                                 long been characterized by the private appropriation of public investments and the
                                 segregation of large population groups who are excluded from access to essential services,
                                 and who reside in favelas and substandard government housing complexes. Thus, the
                                 social struggles for the right to the city have traditionally been linked to structural
                                 urban reform [<a href="#R87">87</a>], and the military police have systematically been used as the primary means by which
                                 the public's freedom of expression, and people's right to life, have been suppressed.

                              <p id="d1e602">Numerous urban reform projects have gutted the city's poorest neighborhoods in service
                                 of the Olympics.  James Freeman discusses these at length in his paper “Neoliberal
                                 Accumulation Strategies and the visible hand of Police Pacification in Rio de Janeiro”
                                 (2012). Freeman links police pacification to the violence of Rio's entrepreneurial
                                 activities centered around developing the city as a mega-events venue—a strategy which
                                 he sees as a clear cut case of accumulation by dispossession. He describes it as the
                                 state engineering of “military conquest and control of territories, and the capture
                                 of assets by force to create outlets for the expansion of private capital” [<a href="#R89">89</a>]. Rio's mega-events have caused so much civil unrest due to these processes, at enormous
                                 public cost, that they haven't even been able to provide the `feel good factor' of
                                 civic pride that normally accompanies them [<a href="#R90">90</a>].

                              <p id="d1e610">It has been estimated that the Olympics may cost Brazil as much as 0.7% of its GDP.
                                 The US$ 11.1 billion in estimated costs (including more than a US$ 1 billion in security)
                                 may eventually reach as much as US$ 16 billion. For Brazil as a whole, the economic
                                 returns are dismal. The event is expected to result in overall gains of less than
                                 0.2% of GDP, and no more than 12,000 in employment opportunities. The IOC, which owns
                                 the majority of broadcasting rights for the Games, is the largest revenue earner,
                                 accounting for almost 50% of total profit from the event.

                              <p id="d1e612">As was the experience with the 2014 World Cup, the Olympics have turned out to be
                                 much costlier than anticipated. Massive cost overruns for 'Olympic legacy projects'
                                 include exorbitant infrastructure spending, more-expensive-than-envisaged sports venues,
                                 and cumbersome security logistics.  In June, the IOC had to advance partial payment
                                 of the US$ 1,045 billion due in August to stave off Rio's cash deficit. A cash shortfall
                                 of R$ 19 billion in Rio's state accounts has resulted in indefinite delays in pension
                                 payments to retirees; thousands of government employee salaries being withheld, including
                                 those of police, teachers and hospital workers; 70 schools  being `occupied' by students;
                                 the State University on strike; and dozens of emergency health units and hospitals
                                 being closed because of a lack of medicines and equipment.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e614">The budget shortfall is in large part due to a dip in the collection of VAT and oil
                                 royalties. According to the State Court of Auditors, Rio granted R$ 138 billion in
                                 tax relief between 2008 and 2013, much of which went to the private construction and
                                 real estate development giants that received the Olympic contracts. This led to the
                                 state’s tax exemptions exceeding the amount of taxes collected. As a result, in June,
                                 just seven weeks before the Games, Rio's acting Governer Francisco Dornelles declared
                                 a “state of public calamity”, pleading for emergency funds in order for the state
                                 to “honor commitments to the Olympics”. This paved the way for Brazil’s Interim President
                                 Michel Temer to inject R$ 2.9 billion in emergency funds into Rio for use in expenses
                                 relating to the public safety of the Games.  Sources at the Rio Olympic Committee
                                 have confided that R$ 1 billion will be spent just on the opening ceremony. State
                                 Representative Marcelo Freixo calls the decree “unconstitutional” [<a href="#R91">91</a>].

                              <p id="d1e619">The city's Olympic facilities contracts were bid on by only one consortium—the Rio
                                 Mais syndicate—which consists of Latin America's largest construction and engineering
                                 giant, Odebrecht [<a href="#R92">92</a>] (whose former CEO is serving a nineteen year prison sentence for corruption [<a href="#R93">93</a>]); Andrade Gutierrez [<a href="#R94">94</a>] (which in May 2016 reached a US$ 286 million settlement in a plea deal with federal
                                 prosecutors for its alleged role in a massive corruption scandal involving oil company
                                 Petrobras); and real estate titan Carvalho Hosken (which was recently forgiven a municipal
                                 tax debt of R$ 7.6 million [<a href="#R95">95</a>, <a href="#R96">96</a>]).

                              <p id="d1e636">The consortium was gifted the land to develop the Olympic Park and will redevelop
                                 the site into luxury condos after the Games. In addition to tax breaks, the city also
                                 paid the consortium R$ 462 million for the Olympic development work, and contributed
                                 another R$ 8 billion in infrastructure to the area to enable the condo development.
                                 Furthermore, thanks to Rio's `exceptionality laws', devised specifically to fast-track
                                 Olympic development without public debate, the consortium has also been able to bypass
                                 a range of building codes and zoning restrictions. In turn, Odebrecht and real estate
                                 property tycoon Carlos Carvalho have made enormous campaign contributions to both

                              <p id="d1e641">Documents uncovered in March 2016 allegedly show that Odebrecht executives are connected
                                 to R$ 1 million in suspected bribes that link to two Olympic legacy projects [<a href="#R98">98</a>]. As a result, in May 2016, federal prosecutors announced an investigation of the
                                 city's Olympic legacy construction projects (it is the city government that oversees
                                 most Olympic construction projects). The investigations include a probe into the federal
                                 funds earmarked to build a series of sewerage treatment plants to clean up Rio's chronically
                                 polluted Guanabara Bay (a project which never transpired); an examination of the five
                                 construction firms that are responsible for building most of the R$ 39 billion in
                                 Olympic venues; the use of R$ 1.76 billion in federal funding for `legacy' infrastructure;
                                 the R$ 8 billion renovation of Rio's Porto Maravilha tourist area; and the expansion
                                 of the city's metro line connecting the main Olympic arena in Barra de Tijuca (another
                                 unfinished project with a 50% cost overrun). Most of these projects have violently
                                 forced the relocation of hundreds of low-income families, yet as Chris Gaffney commented
                                 to Dave Zirin in a recent article published by <i>The Nation</i>, “The Construction Industrial Complex of Brazil is similar to the Military Industrial
                                 Complex of the USA” [<a href="#R99">99</a>]. As such, it is likely to weather any corruption probe. Even if the investigation
                                 directly links to misconduct involving elected officials, it is certain that its scope
                                 will not go so far as to include malfeasance by police [<a href="#R100">100</a>].

                              <p id="d1e655">Brazil's Construction Industrial Complex may be reaping in Olympic profits, but the
                                 country itself is suffering badly. Brazil's national budget deficit is expected to
                                 reach 12% of GDP for 2016, and its gross debt-to-GDP ratio (currently running at 70%)
                                 may rise to an incredible 85%. On a state level, Rio has already defaulted on two
                                 payments of external debt obligations to ADP  (a French development bank) and the
                                 Inter-American Development Bank. The state's overall debt has reached 225% of net
                                 current revenues, to breach the 200% ceiling stipulated by Senate Resolution #40 (2001).
                                 As of April 2016, the state's deficit was amongst the highest in Brazil [<a href="#R101">101</a>].

                              <p id="d1e660">The city is not faring any better with the second highest debt ratio in the country.
                                 Mayor Paes claims he is confident the city can manage it, given the Fiscal Responsibility
                                 Act, which offers a debt ceiling of up to 120% of revenue (currently it is at 30%).
                                 However, in the last three years city revenues have decreased and unemployment and
                                 inflation are on the rise. In addition, immediately following the Olympics almost
                                 30,000 construction workers will be out of jobs, and that is just one employment sector.
                                 Furthermore, repayments on the municipality’s US$1,045 billion World Bank loan (for
                                 urbanization and development) begin in 2017 [<a href="#R102">102</a>]. Rio's financial collapse has strained a range of critical public services, including
                                 public security. Police helicopters have been grounded, patrol cars are without gasoline,
                                 police salaries are being withheld, and incident reports can’t be written because
                                 there is no paper to print them on, or printers left with ink. And there are a lot
                                 of incidents to report in the formal city, where street robberies have risen to an
                                 11-year high [<a href="#R103">103</a>]. Many police units are relying solely on donations of stationery, cleaning supplies,
                                 and toilet paper to remain functioning at all.  At a civil police protest held at
                                 Rio's Galeão airport at the end of June, disgruntled officers greeted international
                                 arrivals with a banner that read “Welcome to Hell. Police and firefighters don't get
                                 paid—whoever comes to Rio de Janeiro will not be safe” [<a href="#R74">74</a>]. The following day, mutilated body parts washed up on the beach in Copacabana near
                                 to the Olympic volleyball pavilion. The police continue to occupy Terminal 2 at Galeão
                                 and to march in protest along the main avenue leading to and from the airport.

                                 (CCPI) as part of an `integrated system of command and control'. The operations are

                                 for Major Events (Sesge). The CCPI and the Anti-terrorism Integrated Center (CIANT)

                                 them inside the favelas [<a href="#R105">105</a>]. It is the largest international police cooperation action in the history of both

                                 is representative of just one aspect of this. The ongoing violence around the Olympic

                              <p id="d1e717">In Rio, the police and the courts are the public institutions most directly involved
                                 in determining the seizure, control, and distribution of property rights. The Police—as

                                 questionable legality of Rio's seizure of favela territory and the mass evictions
                                 and `social cleansing' operations that have ensued. Control over land has had a direct
                                 impact on shaping police actions in relation to these land grabs. The violence with
                                 which they have occurred has undermined any informal (yet legitimate) property rights
                                 of the poor, without neutralizing the ongoing threat posed by the criminal actions
                                 of gangs.

                                 growth is a key and persistent theme across the city and state [<a href="#R108">108</a>], with the police playing a pivotal role in the institutional nexus of the urbanization/development
                                 paradigm. In the favelas, police do not even have to claim that their victims are
                                 armed for them to justify extrajudicial killings. Due to inconsistencies in the public’s
                                 and the police's reporting of crime, it is impossible to quantify the full impact
                                 of police activities inside these communities in terms of human and social cost. However,
                                 it can be said that the state's semi-legal seizure and violent control of favela property
                                 for the Olympics has been a key determinant in generating enormous private, short-term
                                 economic profit from the city's urbanization and development agenda.

                                 put it in context, between 2004 and 2007, there were 23,000 more deaths by homicide
                                 in Brazil than deaths occurring through armed conflicts in Iraq, Sudan, Afghanistan,
                                 Columbia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Sri Lanka, India, Somalia, Nepal, Pakistan,
                                 India, and the Israel/Palestinian territories combined [<a href="#R45">45</a>]. Though homicide rates in Rio's favelas dropped between 2007 and 2012, they are
                                 again rising at an alarming rate. In Rio, one out of five homicides are attributable
                                 to police. The majority of those killed are poor, black youths living in favelas [<a href="#R65">65</a>]. Sharp spikes in extra-judicial killings and rights violations perpetrated by police
                                 transpire exponentially during mega-events, and occur with impunity.

                                 1.2% of the country's GDP annually [<a href="#R109">109</a>]. Security costs due to mega-events increase this number substantially. Despite years
                                 of political rhetoric that has espoused Rios pacification campaign as a cornerstone
                                 of Rio's Olympic legacy, and a promoter of sustainable economic growth, citizen participation,
                                 and good governance [<a href="#R14">14</a>], it is clear that neither it, nor Rio's public security Games Plan in general, has
                                 done much to provide public security for the city.

                              <p id="d1e740">Rather, Rio's militarism is part of a wider framework of `structural violence' that
                                 produces suffering—both directly through acts of violence, torture, and murder, and
                                 indirectly through an institutionalized political social pathology that results in
                                 dispossession, lack, and insecurity. Paul Farmer stresses these “offensives against
                                 human dignity” (2003: 8) are disproportionately perpetrated against the poor (2003:
                                 50) and link to other invisible forms of structural violence that are produced by
                                 transnational political-economic processes (2003: 18) [<a href="#R110">110</a>]—such as the Olympics. The interrelated profit-making goals of the economic elite,
                                 government, and the IOC, directly connect Rio's militarized violence to the flow of
                                 global capital. That is, the processes of exploitation and human rights abuses the
                                 police are enforcing on the ground are historically, institutionally and economically
                                 driven by the State, but attached to a privileged handful of government-backed private
                                 stakeholders that have been able to profit in the billions from Olympic development
                                 opportunities. It is a politico-economic arrangement crafted through a coalition of
                                 laws, policies, privatization, and policing, designed to maximize profiting-making.
                                 It amounts to what Mike Davis describes as “a form of low-intensity warfare” [<a href="#R111">111</a>].

                                 in the years since the announcement of the winning the Olympic Games bid, accounting
                                 for 16% of homicides overall during this period. Those killed by police in revenge
                                 killings and summary executions include children as young as ten years old. Social
                                 media posts by police proudly boast that police “go into the favelas to kill” [<a href="#R07">7</a>]. UPP and Special Ops troops run through the favelas daily with assault rifles drawn,
                                 pointed, and ready to fire. As an outsider working in favelas, I have experienced
                                 this myself many times. And it is terrifying. It is difficult to blame the police,
                                 who, from their perspective, could be shot at any time. It is the policy that is fundamentally
                                 flawed. Military pacification without community dialogue or social investment makes
                                 it impossible to build trust. As a result, institutionalized violence pushes people
                                 toward placing more trust in trafficking gangs and illegal militias than in State-sanctioned

                                 judicial reform, and without dispensation of impunity. Indeed, the UPP program—as
                                 an authentic form of community policing—could potentially have been used as an instrument
                                 to aid in the repair of social rights. The direct relationship between citizens and

                                 and the flow of capital behind it, are apparent. Just a month before the Olympics,
                                 a 78% increase in the number of deaths from police actions (up from 47 deaths in February
                                 to 84 in May), means Rio's police are now killing one person every nine hours. AI
                                 has even launched an app. called Cross-Fire for people to use as a tool to “document

                                 been shot dead and robbed at gunpoint, and young girls have been gang raped. The current

                                 Additionally, the State security apparatus of pacification—that puts policing at the

                                 in Brazil is between 1.38% to 2.3% of the country's total GDP—as much as US$53 billion
                                 annually [<a href="#R119">119</a>]. In a situation where political corruption is as pervasive as this, it is difficult
                                 to propose effective ways in which police corruption can be mitigated. The core of
                                 the problem in Rio is that corruption permeates the political apparatus almost everywhere.
                                 Policy instruments in stable contexts can use public agency to improve conditions
                                 in the public realm. However, in the case of Rio, and Brazil in general, extensive
                                 corruption impedes any situation where regular policy thinking can be applied. Corruption
                                 is a crime that relies on the agencies of the police and the courts to rectify. When
                                 these systems are corrupt to such an extent as they are in Brazil, few in decision-making

                                 such as Rio, it is difficult to suggest concrete policy proposals, though some basic
                                 changes to legal tenants may be proposed to ease some of the problems.

                                 target consumption and the personal and social damage caused by it, as well as policies
                                 that target organized crime and corruption. It goes on to state that the “imposed
                                 harmful policies” of the war on drugs “have had dire consequences—corruption of the
                                 police forces and judiciary and traffic-related violence” [<a href="#R122">122</a>].

                                 What exists is the territorial control of urban favelas by traffickers, who are supplied
                                 with cocaine from neighboring countries, and who distribute the majority of their
                                 supplies to a domestic market, more so than transiting them out of the country. Given
                                 the high rates of poverty and unemployment in favelas, the traffickers easily form
                                 extensive networks of dealers, distributors, and consumers. Rio's large consumer market
                                 is driven mostly by the middle- and upper-income classes. According to Cardoso, “as
                                 long as demand and profitability remain high, it will be difficult to withhold the
                                 attraction that trafficking carries to a young mass of people, including children,
                                 coming from the poorest populations…The police force, with some exceptions, is divided
                                 between those who assent to traffickers and those who enter the favelas to kill. To

                                 a barrier to developing stability within these communities. Provision of social services
                                 and basic soft infrastructure is an important component of an effective response to
                                 poverty. Funding for the staffing and maintenance of social infrastructure facilities
                                 and their programming and services needs to be consistent if any progress is to be
                                 achieved. Currently services are often discontinued due to politically-motivated policy
                                 changes and budget cuts [<a href="#R126">126</a>]. The city's persistent failure to provide stable social infrastructure services

                                 absent in political discourse.  Until these policies are scrutinized in a public forum
                                 by inclusive means, there will be no asset recovery, certainly none that benefits
                                 Rio's informal sectors.  This is a particularly important issue for fragile states
                                 such as Rio, where high-level corruption has recklessly misused, mismanaged, and/or
                                 misappropriated public funds, and where resources are badly needed for reconstruction
                                 and the rehabilitation of informal societal sectors.

                                 such as the establishment of anticorruption bodies, enhanced transparency in the financing

                                 disciplinary measures that promote transparency. Furthermore, accountability in matters
                                 of public finance must be promoted by setting up methods for preventing corruption
                                 in critical areas of the public sector such as the judiciary and public procurement.

                                 undermining the socio-economic stability of cities such as Rio is rarely valued. Instead,
                                 the public spaces of favelas are perceived of as arenas for contestation where people's
                                 already marginalized citizenship freedoms—restricted by poverty, ambiguous legal status,
                                 and systemic violence—need be controlled through unmonitored militarized action [<a href="#R130">130</a>]. This lack of monitoring increases police violence, corruption, economic exploitation
                                 of the citizens, and abuse of the police’s role of protecting public space [<a href="#R120">120</a>].

                                 is only one component.  It is part of a broader condition that is commonly referred
                                 to in Brazil as <i>jeitinho</i>—the way things are done for personal gain at the expense of, and detriment to others
                                 [<a href="#R131">131</a>]. It is clear that the State needs to take steps to reduce the violence the city
                                 of Rio de Janeiro has seen over the past decades—some of the highest rates in the
                                 world.  If Rio had followed through on the vision it lays out in its municipal master
                                 plan—one of sustainable development and the fulfillment of the social function of
                                 the city and of urban property [<a href="#R132">132</a>]—pacification activities in favelas could have theoretically made strides in social
                                 development through participatory means. Unfortunately, gathering the political will
                                 to deliver on such a promise, in a country that is institutionally corrupt and relies
                                 on exerting lethal military force to maintain control over its citizens, remains unlikely.

                                 in the formal city of Rio as they are in the favelas, where the separate public security
                                 policy of military pacification has far more lethal consequences. The outcomes are

                                 of a culture of police corruption that can be linked to organized crime, an increase

                                 internal return of favelas to the pseudo-sovereign state of gang rule leaves residents
                                 with little democratic opportunity to successfully, or peacefully, reconstruct their

                                          and assets. Voluntarists charge that informal enterprises have an unfair advantage
                                          because of their avoidance of formal regulations, taxes, and other costs of production
                                          and services. They argue that informal enterprises should be brought into the formal
                                          regulatory framework in order to increase the tax base and profit margins of the public
                                          and private sectors. The informal sector can also be seen as ille- gal because it
                                          is involved in producing activities that are forbidden, unauthorized, or operate in
                                          non-compliance with regularization laws. At the core of these theories lies an opposition
                                          between the informal and formal. For more see: Rekow, L., Pacification &amp; Mega-events

                                          the chronic lack of basic sanitation, health, educa- tion, child-care facilities,
                                          and educational resources. In addition, the skyrocketing cost of public transportation
                                          used to fund the Olympic transportation routes, cuts in bus lines to and from the
                                          poorer areas of the city, and longer commute times, have reduced opportunities for
                                          the city’s poorer sectors. Though government efforts in relation to the expansion
                                          of social infrastructure and services under pacifica- tion cannot be completely dismissed,
                                          progress remains extremely limited, and even detrimental, in terms of responding to
                                          the needs of the poor. The regular discontinuance of social programs and projects
                                          due to changes in political agendas, parties, personnel, and service agencies, together
                                          with interruptions and abrupt ter- minations in funding and staff resources, also
                                          contributes to the fragmentation and mismanagement of social policies at the local
                                          scale. This is counterproductive to achieving any form of sustain- ability over the
