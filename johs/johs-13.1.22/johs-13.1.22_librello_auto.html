                              greater human security in their communities. Utilizing a conceptual framework based
                              on the capability approach, human security, and securitization theory it considers
                              local actor perceptions of security and the strategies used to achieve their goals.
                              It presents and discusses strategies employed by two distinct actors—a local non-governmental
                              organization and an independent group of community dwellers—in their attempts to achieve
                              security functionings. The results of this qualitative study suggest that while community-level
                              actors view themselves as being empowered as agents in achieving certain human security
                              functionings, the ability of local actors to achieve higher-level functionings is
                              dependent on their recognition as legitimate securitizing agents by more powerful
                              actors and potential partner groups.

                              <p id="d1e75">One of the inherent realities in the human security paradigm—the idea that security's
                                 chief focus is the vulnerabilities of individuals—is that those most acutely aware
                                 of insecurities are often the furthest removed from the resources needed to address
                                 them. In the face of scarcity, local actors may seek external resources. However,
                                 finding support or capital from an external source has its own set of challenges.
                                 Resources earmarked for local-scale projects are limited, and funding may come laden
                                 with obligations tied to other interests. Furthermore, international or state actors
                                 can influence how security and development agendas are implemented in favour of their
                                 own interests. As a result, much of the discourse, policy, and practices can become
                                 disconnected from the people in need. As Liotta and Owen describe it, “idealism thus
                                 becomes enmeshed in realism; actions taken on behalf of the powerless are determined
                                 only by the powerful” [<a href="#R01">1</a>]. Security policies and projects can be developed in a manner that relegates locally
                                 derived human security values to secondary considerations in favour of the interests
                                 of other actors. As a consequence, the pursuit of security can be perceived as operating
                                 in a top-down manner and communities become passive receivers and objects of policy,
                                 not as agents capable of consolidating local security discourse and influencing policy.
                                 Given this context, it is not always possible for local actors to achieve the security
                                 goals which they value most; however, it is incorrect to characterize local actors
                                 as passive, and an injustice to deny the agency they have as security actors. Local
                                 people are often the most important agents for security, deeply involved with improving
                                 the conditions of their communities. For empowered local actors, the lack of resources
                                 can be just another barrier to overcome, not something that builds dependence and
                                 erodes agency. But, in these situations, what differentiates those actors who successfully
                                 pursue security goals in their communities? What strategies can they apply to achieve
                                 their security needs?
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e80">This article presents and reflects on the perspectives of community-level actors regarding
                                 their role in improving security conditions in their communities. Using a conceptual
                                 framework based on the capability approach, human security, and securitization, it
                                 explores the question of how local actors engage in security-making, apply strategies,
                                 and leverage agency to achieve their human security goals. More specifically, it presents
                                 and discusses strategies employed by two distinct actors—a local non-governmental
                                 organization and an independent group of community dwellers—to construct and achieve
                                 valued security functionings. This qualitative study demonstrates that community-level
                                 actors view themselves as agents in achieving human security functionings, despite
                                 recognizing their own limitations in achieving higher-level functionings independently.
                                 Additionally, it shows that expanding human security capabilities can depend on recognition
                                 as legitimate securitizing agents by other actors and partner groups. The first two
                                 sections of this paper present the methodological and theoretical components of the
                                 study. Later sections provide empirical evidence of these strategies and processes
                                 from local community-level actors in the research area, and discuss the implications
                                 for securitization theory in regards to human security—specifically, whether a bottom-up
                                 form of securitization can be applied to analyze local actor security dynamics. In
                                 doing so, this paper argues that more attention is needed to analyzing security dynamics
                                 at the grassroots level, in particular, the role of local actors in sculpting security
                                 values.

                              <p id="d1e85">The study was developed and carried out between September 2012 and December of 2013.
                                 It employed a qualitative case study approach, organized into <i>desk, field</i>, and <i>synthesis</i> phases. Qualitative case study design was selected to provide a fuller exploration
                                 of the complexity inherent in human security as well as a high level of detail on
                                 informant perspectives regarding security strategies [<a href="#R02">2</a>]. The <i>desk</i> phase began with the selection of a research area and the examination of articles
                                 and published reports on development and potential human security issues in that area.
                                 Both broad and narrow definitions of human security were considered. The aim was to
                                 familiarize the researcher with contemporary security and development issues in post-conflict
                                 Liberia, including a knowledge base regarding influential actors and organizations
                                 in the research area. Additionally, it aided in developing interview guides and establishing
                                 a baseline for comparing interview data. Liberia was selected as a research area based
                                 on three factors: firstly, the strong likelihood of diverse individual perspectives
                                 on sources of insecurity given the post-conflict and less-developed country status
                                 of the setting [<a href="#R03">3</a>]; secondly, the presence of significant international organizations focusing on development
                                 and security issues; and thirdly, the widespread use of English that enables the researcher
                                 and informants to communicate clearly and effectively, minimizing the chances for
                                 misinterpretation. Additionally, the historic role of the state as a source of insecurity
                                 coupled with the contemporary weakness of the state suggested that Liberia would likely
                                 have situations in which local and community actors assumed the role as primary security
                                 actors [<a href="#R04">4</a>, <a href="#R05">5</a>, <a href="#R06">6</a>]. Moreover, state misgovernance has been identified elsewhere as being a source of
                                 insecurity itself [<a href="#R07">7</a>]. Social media tools were employed by the researcher to build contacts and garner
                                 further information on potential research communities. A specific case study area
                                 was identified, near the city of Paynesville, selected for the observed presence of
                                 thematically relevant organizations and groups.

                              <p id="d1e115">In September and October of 2013, the <i>field</i> phase of this study used participant observation, group discussions, and one-on-one
                                 interviews as the primary sources of data collection. The interview process consisted
                                 of unstructured and semi-structured components. Twenty-three informants were recruited
                                 through both purposeful and snowball sampling (See: Table <a href="#Tab01">1</a>). Initial informant contact was through social media, then additional informants
                                 were recruited via local networks. This method of convenience sampling helped to effectively
                                 understand the relationships between actors on the ground, highlighting the types
                                 of networks and social capital available to informants [<a href="#R08">8</a>]. Nineteen informants were recruited in this manner, including government workers,
                                 volunteers, and other relevant security actors. Three targeted interviews were conducted
                                 with non-Liberian staff working in fields relevant to human security. A final interview
                                 with the leader of Youth Crime Watch of Liberia (YCWL) confirmed details of the organizations
                                 history, objectives, and strategies. All interviews except one were recorded, transcribed,
                                 and anonymized. The remaining informant, employed in the police services, declined
                                 to be recorded, so the researcher took handwritten notes. One-on-one interviews utilized
                                 an interview guide developed during the <i>desk</i> phase, but iteratively modified during the observation period. Group interviews,
                                 inter-organizational meetings, and relevant written sources such as internal documents
                                 and annual reports provided the researcher with additional details regarding the strategies
                                 applied by the actors in the two cases discussed in this study (See: Table <a href="#Tab02">2</a>).

                              <p id="d1e132">The <i>synthesis</i> phase consisted of data coding using a thematic framework to analyze and process
                                 the informants' responses. Unstructured portions of interviews were coded into emergent
                                 thematic categories generated through multiple readings by the researcher. Semi-structured
                                 portions of the interviews were coded using a framework developed on the basis of
                                 specific question responses as well as the general research questions. The themes
                                 used for analyzing the research were centered on informant definitions of security/insecurities,
                                 perceptions of security responsibility, perceptions of inter-actor relations, and
                                 others.

                                 of threats and insecurities; the capability approach provides an understanding of
                                 values, agency, and a normative reference point; and, securitization gives us an analytical

                                    <p id="d1e424">Exploring the role of local actors in the pursuit of security requires understanding
                                       how security <i>happens</i> at the local level. Security is not a fixed concept and is influenced by a complex
                                       array of structures and variables. Moreover, security is fragmented in terms of subject,
                                       object, and practice [<a href="#R09">9</a>]. Borrowing from the Copenhagen School's notion of securitization, this research
                                       adopts a social constructivist approach to security in order to understand how actors
                                       imbue security with their own values and meanings. Applying this concept to analyze
                                       security dynamics at a local level enables a better understanding of the potential
                                       roles of local actors.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e432">Securitization describes the process in which security threats are socially constructed
                                       through speech acts. The units involved in this process are <i>securitizing agents</i>, <i>referent objects</i>, and <i>functional actors</i> [<a href="#R10">10</a>]. The securitizing agent is an actor who makes a claim that a particular issue—the
                                       referent object—is a threat or is threatened. If the claim is deemed credible by the
                                       functional actors or audience, then that object falls into the realm of security threat
                                       to be acted upon through some kind of special handling [<a href="#R10">10</a>]. This process of actor claims and audience acceptance generates notions of security
                                       and threats. For the purposes of this article, “actor” will refer to the agent making
                                       a claim regarding security and “audience” will refer to those that must evaluate the
                                       legitimacy of said claim.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e449">Framing this process as interplay between claim-making actors and claim-interpreting
                                       audiences fundamentally alters the arena in which security notions are determined.
                                       Williams describes how “not only is the realm of possible threats enlarged, but the
                                       actors or objects that are threatened…can be extended to include actors and objects
                                       well beyond the military security of the territorial state” [<a href="#R11">11</a>]. However, despite this widening of potential actors, not every securitizing claimant
                                       will be successful in shaping security. Thierry Balzacq suggests three considerations
                                       that influence effective securitization: 1) how it is context-dependent; 2) how it
                                       is audience-centered; and 3) the dynamics of power [<a href="#R12">12</a>]. This is reinforced by Williams, who notes that, not all actors are empowered to
                                       make effective claims:
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e457">
                                       <i>While the securitization process is in principle completely open (any “securitizing
                                          actor” can attempt to securitize any issue and referent object), in practice it is
                                          structured by the differential capacity of actors to make socially effective claims
                                          about threats, by the forms in which these claims can be made in order to be recognized
                                          and accepted as convincing by the relevant audience</i> [<a href="#R11">11</a>].
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e465">Securitizing actors require social or political legitimacy to have their claims accepted.
                                       Furthermore, claims need to have a degree of resonance with the values of their audience
                                       [<a href="#R12">12</a>]. Securitizing acts that lack social, cultural, or political relevance to the audience
                                       are unlikely to align with that audience's needs and expectations.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e470">Audience receptivity and the legitimacy of the response is a key aspect of securitization.
                                       Not only are socially derived norms, experiences, and values relevant to what is viewed
                                       as a potential insecurity, they also influence the legitimacy of claims on what actions
                                       can be reasonably taken in response [<a href="#R09">9</a>]. The securitizing agent may be recognized as a legitimate speaker of security, but
                                       agreement on responses towards the referent are still contingent on what is acceptable
                                       to the audience. For example, mass shootings in schools might be a very legitimate
                                       source of insecurity, but it is doubtful that issuing weapons to students would be
                                       regarded as a legitimate response. The audience must deem a security claim in terms
                                       of both the threat and the proposed response.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e475">While securitization is largely about convincing an audience to break free of normal
                                       politics, the process is also intersubjective, having elements of social negotiation
                                       [<a href="#R10">10</a>]. In the context of local actors, this means security claims should focus on issues
                                       and insecurities that are relevant at the local level but retain resonance amongst
                                       potential audiences. Since insecurities at this level are often highly localized,
                                       they may not be intuitively relevant to non-local audiences. A number of factors,
                                       including social and political capital, perceived legitimacy as speakers of security,
                                       and their claims about referent objects, potentially limit the agency of securitizing
                                       actors.

                                    <p id="d1e483">Understanding the role of local actors in the pursuit of security necessitates adopting
                                       a concept of security that is relevant for them. The reality for many people is that
                                       traditional notions of state-based security have limited bearing on their daily lives.
                                       Moreover, through issues like misgovernance, the state has been recognized as a source
                                       of insecurity itself [<a href="#R07">7</a>]. State-oriented traditions of security offer little to address issues like undernourishment
                                       or the persecution of sexual minorities. Security at the local level often has more
                                       to do with underdevelopment and human rights than military or state power.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e488">The association between security and underdevelopment was largely popularized by the
                                       1994 United Nations Development Program (UNDP) Human Development Report [<a href="#R13">13</a>]. The report mainstreamed human security, shifting the focus of security discourse
                                       from a state-centric notion to one that recognized the security needs of individuals
                                       and communities. As Emma Rothschild notes, one of the results of this shift was the
                                       connection drawn between the security of individuals, states, and the international
                                       systems as a whole [<a href="#R14">14</a>]. The post-cold war reality meant that if the world was to be secured, then the security
                                       of individuals needed to be addressed alongside interstate conflicts. Without buttressing
                                       the security of people, the conditions for peace would be untenable. This bound the
                                       individual and the global, creating a space for audience susceptibility to security
                                       claims made by local actors.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e496">Unfortunately, it is a conceptual and logistical challenge to address the diverse
                                       security needs of individuals and groups. Human security acknowledges insecurities
                                       as being highly contextualized. Not only is it difficult to identify specific threats
                                       to individual wellbeing, but it is difficult to codify them in a way that is conducive
                                       to policy development and analysis. The UNDP suggested seven categories of security
                                       threats as potentially destabilizing: economic, food, health, environmental, personal,
                                       community, and political security [<a href="#R13">13</a>]. However, this range of concepts was somewhat unwieldly, which is perhaps why the
                                       Commission on Human Security (CHS) reformulates human security as follows:

                                       <i>Human security in its broadest sense embraces far more than the absence of violent
                                          conflict. It encompasses human rights, good governance, access to education and health
                                          care, and ensuring that each individual has opportunities and choices to fulfil his
                                          or her own potential…Freedom from want, freedom from fear and the freedom of the future
                                          generations to inherit a healthy natural environment – these are the interrelated
                                          building blocks of human, and therefore national security</i> [<a href="#R15">15</a>].
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e509">Security expands beyond survival and recognizes the need to live a life that individuals
                                       have cause to value. This reformulation creates a more manageable conceptual paradigm,
                                       but it offers little to help delineate units of analysis or understand how individuals
                                       determine priorities and appraise security needs. Freedom from fear and want may capture
                                       the fundamental imagery, but does little to provide a blueprint for policy, practice,
                                       and analysis. The non-specificity of the core requirements of human security is at
                                       the heart of much of the critique of the concept [<a href="#R16">16</a>, <a href="#R17">17</a>, <a href="#R18">18</a>]. However, in a study of numerous National Human Development Reports (NHDR), Richard
                                       Jolly and Deepayan Basu Ray [<a href="#R19">19</a>] demonstrate that when human security analyzes <i>have</i> been executed, these criticisms fail to manifest as impediments to operationalizing
                                       a conceptually open, people-centered, and context-dependent framework. Jolly and Basu
                                       Ray's analysis suggests that developing a concrete list of human security components
                                       or factors is not necessary from an operational point of view—human security needs
                                       can effectively be identified “in theater”, so to speak. However, while their analysis
                                       demonstrates the value of flexible definitions, it does little to explain how security
                                       values and needs are constructed at the individual level. To bridge this gap this
                                       study employed the capability approach.

                                    <p id="d1e529">The capability approach is a normative evaluative framework focused on the ability
                                       of individuals to achieve the things they value through expanding real freedoms and
                                       opportunities. The fundamental units of this approach are <i>functionings</i> and <i>capabilities</i> [<a href="#R20">20</a>]. Functionings are those things that an individual has cause to value doing or being.
                                       Capabilities are freedoms and capacities that enable one to achieve various functionings.
                                       The classic example is that of a starving child as compared to a fasting monk. Eating,
                                       fasting, and starving are all potential functionings, however, fasting is fundamentally
                                       different from starving because for the monk it is a choice. The monk exists in a
                                       situation of greater security, retaining the ability to eat if exposed to a deterioration
                                       in livelihood.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e540">Generally, the capability approach is not conventionally folded into discussions of
                                       human security except for when one is clarifying the distinction between human development
                                       and human security [<a href="#R19">19</a>, <a href="#R21">21</a>]. However, this paper argues that the ability of individuals and communities to achieve
                                       human security goals—herein referred to as <i>security functionings</i>—is a capability worth measuring in itself. Individuals are fundamental agents in
                                       the pursuit of security functionings. Not considering agency and choices in relation
                                       to security alienates individuals from the values that matter most to them.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e551">The connection between values, agency, and security-making is at the heart of this
                                       research and is articulated by the CHS, in that “human security must also aim at developing
                                       the capabilities of individuals and communities to make informed choices and to act
                                       on behalf of causes and interests in many spheres of life” [<a href="#R15">15</a>]. This means creating the conditions for the expansion of capabilities of people
                                       to pursue security functionings. Efforts to support human security must be evaluated
                                       by whether or not they expand opportunities and remove barriers to the pursuit of
                                       human security functionings.

                                    <p id="d1e556">The question is how to identify the functionings that are valued by local level actors?
                                       Several authors have attempted to codify universal capabilities lists or sets to apply
                                       as a supplement to Sen's framework [<a href="#R22">22</a>, <a href="#R23">23</a>, <a href="#R24">24</a>, <a href="#R25">25</a>, <a href="#R26">26</a>, <a href="#R27">27</a>]. However, Sen has himself remained skeptical of these attempts:

                                    <p id="d1e585">Externally creating lists of capabilities precludes participation and thereby undermines
                                       local values. To understand how local values manifest, it is essential to look for
                                       security needs expressed and pursued by local actors themselves. Making a security
                                       claim can be interpreted as an expression of value— a declaration that a particular
                                       functioning is needed to assure a security goal. The referent object represents a
                                       valued security functioning, or some combination of doings or beings that if not achieved
                                       will result in insecurity.

                                    <p id="d1e587">Not all security functionings will be the subject of a security claim. Social and
                                       political contexts influence which values are likely to be presented, and claims might
                                       not represent the most critical security needs. Social structures and power disparity
                                       will inevitably influence the values that are expressed within social groups [<a href="#R29">29</a>]. Denuelin and McGregor [<a href="#R30">30</a>] have argued that the capability approach needs to be strengthened through a recognition
                                       of how social factors influence the development values. Our social nature influences
                                       which referent objects become subject to security claim. When considering human security
                                       concerns we must be cognizant of how social factors impact value-forming and security-making
                                       processes in three ways: firstly, social dynamics influence which functionings are
                                       valued; secondly, power dynamics influence which values are expressed as a security
                                       claim; and thirdly, these influences are potentially omnidirectional, including those
                                       coming from non-local actors. The research investigates the existence of local capabilities
                                       by exploring the dynamics of how valued security functionings manifest and the strategies
                                       employed by local actors to achieve them. It utilizes the idea of securitization to
                                       analyze the ways in which local actors construct and position their security needs.
                                       Furthermore, it considers the differential capacity of actors to make effective claims
                                       about security.

                              <p id="d1e598">The results of this study will be presented in two parts. First, we present data relating
                                 to understandings of insecurities in communities and perspectives on actor agency
                                 in the pursuit of improved human security. This provides us with insight into how
                                 local individuals identify valued security functionings and reflect upon their own
                                 agency in achieving them. Second, we present two sample cases in which local actors
                                 adopted strategies to achieve their security goals. This section digs deeper into
                                 the specific strategies through which local actors attempt to achieve their valued
                                 security functionings. These parallel but differently successful strategies show that
                                 not all local actors have the same range of capabilities in terms of achieving their
                                 security goals.

                                    <p id="d1e603">As this research sought to understand local actors as security agents, a key consideration
                                       is how informants views their notion of a secure life, their capacity to identify
                                       insecurities in their communities, and their ideas about the responsibility and power
                                       to pursue security goals. The aim of this line of investigation is to uncover the
                                       existence of locally valued security functionings and the informants' perceived level
                                       of agency in achieving those goals.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e605">In regards to the informants' ideas on important security functionings, views were
                                       broad but largely consistent with the idea of human security. Some respondents had
                                       a fairly simple conception of security. For Jack, “…security means protection. Security
                                       means to have a bed peace, that when you are sleeping, when you have security in your
                                       environment. When you have security, you can sleep well” [<a href="#R03">3</a>]. The connection between safety and security was echoed by Max, who additionally
                                       described employment as key to both his own security, and also in reducing crime in
                                       his community [<a href="#R13">13</a>]. Others linked security to more complex, emotional or social needs. A geology student,
                                       Tim, linked security to his ability “…to feel proud and I feel that with security
                                       I can contribute immensely to the good and development of my country” [<a href="#R02">2</a>]. Interestingly, two informants responded by addressing the complexity of security
                                       as a concept. Mark asked, “When you say secure, what do you mean? Food security? Safety?”
                                       [<a href="#R21">21</a>] Luke had similar concerns, reflecting that “…security is a broad terminology and
                                       could refer to your daily life, it could refer to an entire country” [<a href="#R20">20</a>]. Informants' notions of security were generally reflective of the complexity found
                                       in human security discourses.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e622">When asked about specific insecurities they felt needed to be addressed, responses
                                       were varied. The most common concern was criminal activity, however, Fred, Eric, and
                                       Max saw it as being connected to issues of poor infrastructure, unemployment, and
                                       a failure to meet basic needs. [<a href="#R07">7</a>, <a href="#R13">13</a>, <a href="#R15">15</a>] Fred was concerned about the lack of electricity, saying, “…where there is no electricity,
                                       you see them burglarizing (…) and go and hijacking people.” Eric was concerned about
                                       infrastructure as a threat to the ability of students to go to school to study, saying,
                                       “…everywhere in Liberia, the road is damaged. No electricity. We are in darkness”.
                                       The lack of basic infrastructure was also tied to health security by Mark, who expressed
                                       concerns regarding waste management:

                                    <p id="d1e640">The fence surrounding Mark's home was used as a dumping area in the community for
                                       refuse—or “dirt” in the colloquial Liberian. Sanitation and refuse management as a
                                       health threat was well recognized by informants.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e642">Additionally, food security was mentioned by Max, Jack, and Steven as being an ongoing
                                       concern [<a href="#R03">3</a>, <a href="#R13">13</a>, <a href="#R21">21</a>]. Max observed that they “…have kids that are hungry in the community and we find
                                       that are not good looking, like malnutrition” and it becomes a concern for the entire
                                       community. Steve went further, suggesting that food insecurity often led to criminal
                                       activity. Again, the sources of insecurity identified by the informants were broad,
                                       and often interconnected. Moreover, the ready ability to identify insecurities in
                                       their communities suggests a sense of value or priority in relation to needed security
                                       functionings.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e653">Informants had mixed responses when asked about how to address insecurities and who
                                       was responsible for improving security conditions. Informants recognized the need
                                       for multi-level approaches to addressing insecurities, but responses varied based
                                       on the type of insecurity. On the issue of economic security, informants pointed vaguely
                                       towards the government. Eric felt that the government needed “…to put some measure
                                       into place” for encouraging job creation.[<a href="#R07">7</a>] Similarly, Tim believed that the government was responsible for getting young people
                                       off the streets [<a href="#R02">2</a>]. Generally, the economy and jobs were largely seen as the realm of government actors,
                                       however, Zack and Steven felt that community groups had a role in creating education
                                       opportunities locally [<a href="#R16">16</a>, <a href="#R17">17</a>, <a href="#R18">18</a>, <a href="#R29">29</a>]. Group discussions pointed towards a divided role with the community supporting
                                       individuals to develop entrepreneurial skills, but the need for government actors
                                       to do more to support secure employment through economic development.

                                    <p id="d1e674">Safety and crime elicited a starkly divided response. Eric, John, and Omar felt that
                                       neighbourhood watch or vigilante groups were a major source of security [<a href="#R07">7</a>, <a href="#R09">9</a>, <a href="#R31">31</a>]. Other informants believed that the Liberian National Police (LNP) should be responsible,
                                       but that their limited capacity and reputation for corruption made it difficult. Mike
                                       argued that repairing that reputation would reduce reliance on vigilante groups [<a href="#R01">1</a>]. Arnold believed the best solution was for community watch groups to “ensure that
                                       every activity they carry on, they liaise with the Liberian National Police” [<a href="#R19">19</a>]. For him, responsibility was shared between levels and actors. Otto had a similar
                                       view, saying, “…the community do have the responsibility to address the issue of security
                                       for the fact that the community knows best” [<a href="#R32">32</a>]. In general, informants felt that the role of the community was undervalued by non-local
                                       actors.

                                    <p id="d1e695">When discussing how cooperative efforts worked in reality, Arnold, Luke, and Max took
                                       issue with some NGOs' approaches [<a href="#R13">13</a>, <a href="#R19">19</a>, <a href="#R20">20</a>]. Citing an example of a well drilled too close to a mass grave for local people's
                                       comfort, Max said “organizations that work in communities would just come in and carry
                                       on projects. They make a lot of mistakes and a lot of things goes wrong.” Luke argued
                                       that the lack of democratic input from local people was also a problem, recalling
                                       an NGO project from a community he had visited:
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e706">
                                       <i>…some NGO built a market center there. And the market center they built…somewhere
                                          on the football field of that town. But I'm sure there weren't a lot of consultation
                                          with them. Probably maybe the town chiefs just agreed to give that land and just build
                                          it there, they didn't even consult with them</i> [<a href="#R20">20</a>].
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e715">Lack of local participation was viewed as an impediment to ownership. Luke felt that
                                       NGO consultation with chiefs did not guarantee the respecting of local values or local
                                       involvement. Jack and James felt that local chiefs had an important role in conveying
                                       the needs of the community to higher-level actors.[<a href="#R03">3</a>, <a href="#R08">8</a>] Relating to social and symbolic capital, Jack felt that the chief or elected representative
                                       was in a better position to speak for the community, saying, “…as a local person,
                                       we cannot go and say `we need this, we need that' ” Many informants felt that international
                                       and even some national structures and agencies were out of reach for locals. Max went
                                       so far as to describe international groups as being “afraid of the air” [<a href="#R13">13</a>]. These types of comments were reflective of a perceived barrier between local and
                                       non-local actors. This lack of access to audiences who could help was a compounding
                                       issue for many, especially in context of poor infrastructure.

                                    <p id="d1e726">If taken at face value, these responses suggest informants felt they lacked agency
                                       in dealing with insecurities, however, when probed on the topic informants emphasized
                                       the importance of local actors. Otto, a particularly strong supporter of controversial
                                       vigilante groups, attested to this saying that “security is actually everybody's problem.
                                       It is not an individual problem. When it is at the door of one individual it is good
                                       that every other person go to help solve that problem” [<a href="#R32">32</a>]. He held that individuals and communities had to involve themselves more in situations
                                       where state sources of security were absent. Zack argued for a shared responsibility,
                                       stressing cooperation between communities and government:

                                       security within communities as follows:

                                    <p id="d1e758">The diversity of responses regarding strategies for achieving security functionings
                                       and working within the social and political structure highlights a broad understanding
                                       of how local agency can be applied. Informants had clear concerns regarding insecurities,
                                       types of preferred responses, and strategies on how they would address them. What
                                       emerges from this threefold: firstly, local actors have defined values in regards
                                       to security; secondly, local actors have priorities and preferences relating to the
                                       solutions to insecurities; and thirdly, local actors have a strong concept of their
                                       own agency and strategies for achieving their valued security functionings. We can
                                       then say that interviewees have a strong sense of which security functionings they
                                       value, and at least some notions of how they would prefer to see them addressed. In
                                       the next sections we will explore the reality of how some local actors attempt to
                                       achieve security functionings. In doing so we will see the challenges for local actor
                                       efforts to move beyond valued functionings into the realm of real capabilities.

                                    <p id="d1e763">The first case for discussion in this study is that of a locally operating NGO called
                                       Youth Crime Watch of Liberia (YCWL). The organization was founded by a group of community
                                       dwellers who recognized that crime and a lack of youth engagement were a persistent
                                       problem in their community. Young people were regularly exposed to drugs, alcohol,
                                       and were at risk for recruitment into criminal gangs. The focus has evolved over time,
                                       moving beyond crime reduction into issues of youth employment, gender-based violence,
                                       amongst others [<a href="#R32">32</a>]. A senior manager with YCWL describes the organization as “…engaging the minds of
                                       young people for positive outcomes. We believe in awareness raising education as well
                                       as…programs such as life skills and job creation” [<a href="#R30">30</a>]. YCWL has at times used a branch structure with groups operating across a number
                                       of communities and educational institutions, enabling them to build networks and leverage
                                       the social capital of their members. As such, YCWL has employed a strategy of consolidating
                                       public support and coordinating with other actors in the pursuit of their goals.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e771">In the first year of operation, YCWL pursued accreditation from the Ministry of Planning
                                       and Economics Affairs and Ministry of Youth and Sports, and also sought membership
                                       with the Federation of Liberian Youth [<a href="#R31">31</a>]. Recognizing that connections with local police would be essential towards their
                                       success as an organization, YCWL signed a memorandum of understanding with the LNP.
                                       The organization focused on building a reputation among national-level organizations,
                                       leading to opportunities with international organizations such as the United Nations
                                       Mission in Liberia (UNMIL), the UNDP, amongst others [<a href="#R31">31</a>]. These connections built credibility amongst national and international actors.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e779">Following accreditation, YCWL expanded to different educational institutions. During
                                       this time YCWL recognized that gender issues needed to be a priority, in particular,
                                       gender-based violence. YCWL sought support from UNMIL to plan a rally against gender
                                       based violence as a way of “buttressing National Government and women organizations
                                       who have continued to struggle for rape prevention, education and public awareness”
                                       [<a href="#R31">31</a>]. The aim of the program was to give community youth and elders an opportunity to
                                       discuss sexual violence and prevention strategies. Recognizing the sensitivity of
                                       the issue, YCWL invited Liberian comedian Georgio Boutini to draw in participants.
                                       By partnering with actors across all levels, including Liberian celebrities, YCWL
                                       built a reputation as an organization that understands the local people and acts as
                                       a bridge with international organizations [<a href="#R30">30</a>]. This kind of social capital granted them a great deal of credibility and legitimacy
                                       when speaking on behalf of communities.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e787">Gender issues have continued to be a theme for the organization. By 2010 YCWL resolved
                                       that the best way to improve security for women was through local empowerment and
                                       education opportunities for women and girls [<a href="#R33">33</a>]. YCWL began holding seminars aimed at empowering young women and raising awareness
                                       of gender issues with public rallies and retreats. Moreover, the organization was
                                       able to procure funding to build their Young Women's Empowerment through approaching
                                       the Japanese Government Grant for Grassroots Human Security Projects (GGP) scheme
                                       [<a href="#R34">34</a>]. Their success in these areas has led to them finding opportunities to influence
                                       other security endeavours, such as the Early Warning Early Response Working Group
                                       [<a href="#R35">35</a>].

                                       that it could only be used to finance the construction and outfitting of the center
                                       with basic equipment [<a href="#R36">36</a>]. Moreover, the group lacked female leadership to lend credibility to their role
                                       as an organization for empowering women, and the current leadership expressed concerns
                                       regarding their ability to secure funding for women's programming [<a href="#R36">36</a>]. By the end of the research period, the leadership of the organization was laying
                                       plans for the drilling of a well, recruiting candidates for a female head of the center,
                                       and searching for fundraising opportunities. The group has since secured further funding
                                       from the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD) to continue their efforts.

                                       that they value. Their ability to build networks with other local, national, and international
                                       level actors has enabled them to act as a bridge between community dwellers and other
                                       actors. Having roots in both the local community and connections to international
                                       agencies has put pressure on the small group to be accountable and transparent. Future
                                       challenges for the organization include gender inclusiveness in decision making, and
                                       staying transparent and accountable. Furthermore, finding stable funding for programming
                                       at their new center is certain to come with new donor pressures. YCWL does not yet
                                       have the ability to operate completely independently to pursue all the security functionings
                                       that they value. Accessing resources remains dependent on appeals to external actors.
                                       Despite this, it can be said that the strategies they have applied to pursue security
                                       functionings have been effective, clearly indicating the existence of security capabilities.

                                       themselves as a legitimate security actor in their community, not all actors have
                                       the capacity to implement the same strategies. Others lack the networks or social
                                       capital required to generate legitimacy. One of the informants for this project, Eric,
                                       has struggled to overcome these challenges in his attempts to build a school in his
                                       remote community. His story is an example of how some local actors can act as security
                                       agents but still be frustrated by the self-interest of others.

                                       alongside volunteer teachers from an international NGO. During this time Eric developed
                                       an appreciation for the importance of education in creating opportunities for young

                                    <p id="d1e833">The lack of educational opportunities was seen as a burden on the community and the
                                       government. Moreover, the long distance between the community and the local school
                                       created fears that the children would be exposed to dangers on their commute. Eric,
                                       his friends, and his family decided that they needed to construct an elementary school
                                       in their community. The first step in the process was to rally local support, and
                                       this would become their first roadblock.

                                    <p id="d1e835">Eric and his colleagues explained that mustering support from their community was
                                       not easy. While discussing the school project in a local cafe, Otto explained that
                                       “…before you can venture into a community to carry out the projects, you need to synthesize
                                       mission, you need to synthesize people. If you just go there and want to begin the
                                       project immediately it might somehow be difficult” [<a href="#R32">32</a>].

                                       community as a whole. This was evident when the group met resistance raising support
                                       to build the school. The group decided that maybe the best way to earn support was
                                       to focus on a specific audience within the community:
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e842"><i>What we did, we went to the women and talked to the women. Because we have this school
                                          in one village, about an hour and a half walk to that school, we told the women that
                                          if you sit here and refuse that this project comes to your community, you are risking

                                    <p id="d1e849">While initially resistant to the idea, the men of the community recognized the values
                                       and concerns of their wives and were convinced for the need for a local school. For
                                       Eric and Otto, this was a key step and they quickly rallied support from other community
                                       members who agreed to donate land and to help with the construction of the school

                                    <p id="d1e855">The next barrier was finding a donor. Eric reached out to his international contacts
                                       from his time teaching in Ghana. One of his former co-workers put Eric in touch with
                                       a group in Israel willing to donate. However, the group had expressed concerns about
                                       the legitimacy of the project and asked for documentation (building plans, cost estimates,
                                       etc.) and for an inspection of the proposed location [<a href="#R37">37</a>]. Eric was sympathetic and felt that international groups had legitimate fears concerns
                                       for working smaller groups because trusting local level actors is not always safe:
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e860"><i>…to trust somebody is not easy to do. Because there are a lot of people they offer

                                    <p id="d1e867">While the NGO reluctance to trust local level actors with funds was frustrating, it
                                       was also understandable by the group. Eric felt that while it restricted local opportunities
                                       to freely pursue goals, it was reasonable because some local actors' motives could
                                       be dishonest. Eric and Otto prepared the documents while waiting for an inspector
                                       to arrive from Accra to compile his report on the site.

                                    <p id="d1e869">Once the inspector arrived, Eric's family hosted him for several days, explaining
                                       the project and showing him around the community. Afterwards, Eric was told to wait
                                       for a response from the donors based on the report [<a href="#R07">7</a>]. Unfortunately, it never came. After months of waiting to hear from donors, Eric
                                       phoned them directly. They explained that they had never received the report. The
                                       inspector had taken his payment and could not be contacted. When Eric asked if they
                                       were still willing to help the project, they declined but said that they would be
                                       willing to support a different project:

                                       and hosting the Ghanaian inspector, Eric felt let down by the experience. Exploitation

                                 hold complex notions of security that included both individual and social aspects.
                                 Informants expressed concerns for security in terms of physical safety, nutrition,
                                 unemployment, education, and more. Furthermore, informants acknowledged that insecurities
                                 were often interrelated, with issues of criminality and personal safety being connected
                                 to problems in the economic or social systems. The ability of the informants to readily
                                 identify and discuss human security threats and solutions in their communities illustrates
                                 the existence of preferences on human security functionings. In the language of capabilities
                                 approach, these types of responses suggest that informants have values in regards
                                 to the capabilities needed to feel secure in their lives. These responses suggest
                                 that types of security concerns held by community dwellers are well reflected by conventional
                                 interpretations of human security. Based on this, it is clear that the human security
                                 concept holds relevance and is applicable to the security values and needs of local-level
                                 actors in the research area. Whether informants felt they had the real freedom or
                                 agency to achieve these human security functionings is another matter.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e899">When interviews explored the role of local actors and communities in addressing and
                                 managing insecurities, informants showed similar complex and self-reflective opinions.
                                 Informants clearly indicated that in many situations they felt that capabilities existed
                                 for implementing certain responses or strategy on their own (e.g. night patrols),
                                 in other situations they recognized their limitations (e.g. well-drilling). When it
                                 came to discussions of who were the primary actors for achieving security functionings,
                                 informants identified a mixed system, where the local communities, the police, NGOs,
                                 and government actors all held some responsibility to contribute. Informants stressed
                                 the need for local people to be involved in the process of addressing insecurities,
                                 citing planning errors and misunderstandings that could have been avoided with the
                                 help of local knowledge. These types of responses suggest that informants felt that
                                 there is not only a need for community-level actors to be involved in addressing insecurities,
                                 but that local actors possessed key knowledge and agency that was often needed to
                                 ensure the successful resolution of insecurities. This indicates a mixed level of
                                 capabilities in which some human security functionings were considered achievable
                                 utilizing local capacity alone, but others required non-local support.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e901">In terms of identifying clear demonstrations of the application of local agency as
                                 security actors, the results were less definitive. The cases of YCWL and Eric's group
                                 clearly highlight that not all local actors have the same level of capabilities in
                                 terms of security. While YCWL represents an example of a successful strategy applied
                                 by a local actor, Eric's efforts failed in achieving security functionings. Why did
                                 one case succeed and the other fail? Consider the difference in terms of actor characteristics,
                                 the responses advocated, and audience receptivity.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e903">YCWL's efforts since its foundation have effectively carved out a position as legitimate
                                 and respected speakers for security. The strategies that they have employed have focused
                                 on mustering community support and official recognition as a form of legitimacy, and
                                 leverage this with international funding agencies. This was a slow but effective process
                                 to amplify their social and political capital, gaining recognition as speakers of
                                 security regarding community and local level needs. Leveraging this legitimacy, YCWL
                                 was able to access the Japanese government's grassroots grant program with a securitizing
                                 move around a referent that fell across shared values. Moreover, the fact that the
                                 responses advocated by YCWL were tuned to human security needs well recognized by
                                 their international audiences was undoubtedly a major factor in their success. The
                                 audience-compatible security claims of YCWL in combination with the time spent earning
                                 credibility with local community members, national, and international actors undoubtedly
                                 helped YCWL secure the resources needed to achieve their desired security functionings.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e905">The strategies applied by Eric's group were focused on using security rhetoric to
                                 accomplish their goals and shape public opinion. This strategy was very effective
                                 at mustering local support and is essentially a type of bottom-up securitization strategy.
                                 Targeting women as an initial audience for security claims, and then leveraging that
                                 with local men resulted in special handling at the local level in the form of donated
                                 land. Unfortunately, this strategy hit a ceiling when it came to international actors.
                                 The reasons for this appear to be two-fold: firstly, the group's lack of legitimacy
                                 in that field created a barrier between them and funders; and secondly, the funders
                                 - while open to hearing security claims - were not entirely in agreement with the
                                 proposed resolution to the security problem. They did not accept the security objectives
                                 advocated by Eric as a securitizing agent, instead, the funders advocated for an alternative
                                 solution to the one advocated by Eric's group. The free-trade business solution proposed
                                 by the funders did not match the values of the community. One can speculate as to
                                 whether something like NGO accreditation would have made a difference, but it is clear
                                 that the audience failed to resonate with Eric's security claims. Not only was the
                                 community unable to address the source of insecurity in their community, but Eric
                                 suffered a loss of social capital. Failure to securitize in this situation came at
                                 a significant social cost to the securitizing agent.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e907">Even though Eric's claims were relatively non-controversial— bridging themes of education
                                 and sexual violence—they failed to resonate strongly with the audience. Given Liberia's
                                 post-war, less developed country context it is unlikely that the claims were rejected
                                 based on the nature of the threat alone. The key difference between YCWL and Eric's
                                 group was in the form of social capital and power they had at their disposal. While
                                 the aims of both actors were similar— situated around issues of gender, crime, violence,
                                 and education—YCWL was more successful in their strategy. In terms of Balzacq's (2005)
                                 criteria [<a href="#R12">12</a>], audience receptivity to Eric's claims was likely weakened by the lack of social
                                 capital, thereby shifting the power relations to favour a response alternative to
                                 that of the securitizing agent. The failure to achieve these security functionings
                                 at a comparable level indicates an inequality or deficiency in regards to security
                                 capabilities. From the cases here, it is apparent that local actors may not be able
                                 to assume the same expectation of agency and thereby the same level of capabilities
                                 when it comes to achieving human security functionings. Differential capacity may
                                 drive actors to adopt more conventional strategies, as YCWL did, or alternatively,
                                 to employ more strategic methods, such as the type of bottom-up micro-securitizations
                                 we saw from Eric's group.

                              <p id="d1e915">This research has shown that sufficiently empowered local actors can be effective
                                 agents for improving human security conditions in their communities. Local actors
                                 are clearly able to put voice to security claims and functionings, however, the ability
                                 of local actors to achieve human security functionings that are beyond their normal
                                 means are dependent on the ability of to augment their resources through external
                                 sources. This requires legitimacy as a speaker of security, and cultivating legitimacy
                                 was a key part of the strategies employed in both the cases presented. Unfortunately,
                                 as Eric's case illustrates, not all local actors have the social or political capital
                                 required to generate legitimacy at higher levels, and thus they may lack capabilities
                                 to pursue valued security functionings. Moreover, when bottom-up securitization strategies
                                 are applied by local actors, their effectiveness appears to be dependent on the value
                                 placed on socio-political factors by audiences, which fell outside of the objective
                                 of this research. Understanding how bottom-up securitization strategies work as a
                                 means of enhancing capabilities requires a deeper investigation of actor/audience
                                 relations and what types of factors influence the receptivity of audiences; however,
                                 it is clear that securitization is a strategy that can be applied by local actors
                                 to leverage agency. As such, this research suggests two considerations to human security
                                 minded actors both in Liberia and abroad: firstly, local actors should evaluate how
                                 their legitimacy as speakers of security is interpreted by funding audiences; secondly,
                                 funding audiences should consider the ways in which their criteria for legitimate
                                 claims may actually worsen local security conditions. Cases such as this highlight
                                 the challenges for local actors to achieve their security. More importantly, they
                                 illustrate how the capabilities for local actors to achieve security functionings
                                 is heavily contingent on the expansion of opportunities for community-level actors
                                 to participate in security-making processes.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e917">Recommendations for further research include a fuller exploration of the theoretical
                                 basis for bottom-up securitization, a meta-analysis of the cases examining the effectiveness
                                 of local actors as securitizing actors, as well as an empirical study of how audiences
                                 perceive bottom-up securitizing acts in order to confirm whether audiences perceive
                                 local actors as securitizing agents, or at least speakers for security. The question
                                 as to which kinds of social and political capital generate the legitimacy in a bottom-up
                                 securitizing act is of key interest to this research. Understanding how the audiences
                                 of bottom-up security claims interpret legitimacy of both claimants and responses
                                 is a key question for future research. If such questions can be answered, both local
                                 and non-local actors can potentially improve their ability to ensure the achievement
                                 of the most critical and locally valued human security functionings.
