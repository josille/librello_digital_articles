                                 policing (COP) was viewed by many as the means by which the country had avoided the
                                 crime and insecurity reported elsewhere in Central America. Paralleling these positive
                                 claims, the Nicaraguan National Police have emphasized particular characteristics
                                 of the COP model as the basis of this success. The Nicaraguan COP model is founded
                                 on three ethical pillars i.e. that it is communitarian, proactive and preventative.
                                 In this article, we detail the development of the Nicaraguan community-policing model
                                 and evaluate its historical and persisting significance as the guarantor of law and
                                 order through a critical evaluation of these claims and characteristics. The article
                                 demonstrates the abiding significance of the Nicaraguan COP model, and the distinctive
                                 nature of its operation. In contrast to prevailing regional trends there is much to
                                 learn from policing that emphasizes dialogue with the community over a reliance on
                                 technological or strong-arm solutions. However, the article also observes severe challenges
                                 regarding its current capacities and its erosion as a result of the pressures of presidential
                                 authoritarianism, political corruption and securitization. This erosion of the COP
                                 model has negatively affected the conditions of human security in Nicaragua and is
                                 a significant factor explaining the character of recent violence.</span></div>

                              <p id="d1e108">Multiple publications have claimed in recent years that Nicaragua had escaped the
                                 wave of crime and insecurity suffered by its neighbors [<a href="#R01">1</a>, <a href="#R02">2</a>, <a href="#R03">3</a>]. The Nicaraguan model for community-based policing (COP) was heralded in particular
                                 as a success story in a series of reports written by international organizations [<a href="#R04">4</a>, <a href="#R05">5</a>]. A series of donor institutions also praised the Nicaraguan community-based policing
                                 model. They suggest that the COP model is a key reason why the country has been able
                                 to avoid the serious conditions of organized crime, violence and homicide registered
                                 in the Northern Triangle countries (Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras) [<a href="#R06">6</a>, <a href="#R07">7</a>]. The recent wave of political unrest and multiple violent clashes between the national
                                 police and protesters that have left over ca. 400 people dead [<a href="#R08">8</a>] suggests that these claims were overstated. These events have taken many observers
                                 by surprise. However, as we observe below recognition of a series of political reforms
                                 and changes to police practice, and the Nicaraguan community based model in particular,
                                 assist explanation of both the country’s earlier success in combatting violent crime
                                 and the current national crisis in political and public order.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e135">Drawing on recent qualitative research [<a href="#R09">9</a>], in this article we critically consider what is distinctive about the Nicaraguan
                                 COP model. In order to consider its strengths and weaknesses the article evaluates
                                 the Nicaraguan COP model’s own claims to distinction i.e. that its success is based
                                 on homegrown foundations of policing as <i>communitarian, proactive and preventative</i>. The article initially explores the regional setting for community based policing.
                                 The article proceeds from this to a direct exploration of the distinctive origins
                                 and nature of Nicaragua’s COP model. The Nicaraguan COP model is as much the product
                                 of the Sandinista Revolution as later attempts in sync with regional trends towards
                                 professionalization and institutional reform. Attention is furthermore given to each
                                 of the claims regarding the model’s foundations and consideration made whether current
                                 dynamics sustain or problematize their function. In progressing through an analysis
                                 of each of the model’s foundational claims it should be evident that the article aims
                                 to form a balanced critique of the Nicaraguan COP model. As such, recognition is made
                                 of its achievements, but also evidences made of internal institutional challenges
                                 and new external threats. In conclusion, we furthermore highlight how the recent reform
                                 of security policy and changing police practice have had severe consequences for the
                                 conditions of human security in the country. The recent turn from COP to a reactive
                                 form of policing has heightened tensions between local communities and the police
                                 and contributed to the violent episodes that have taken place in the country in recent
                                 months.

                              <p id="d1e146">Efforts to reform the police forces in Latin America multiplied throughout the region
                                 in the 1990s [<a href="#R12">12</a>], encouraged by the return to democratic rule of law across the region in the same
                                 period. The wave of reform matches the trend for the introduction of COP programs
                                 in other post-conflict contexts elsewhere in the world [<a href="#R13">13</a>]. The signing of peace accords between the governments and armed opposition in El
                                 Salvador and Guatemala respectively in 1991 and 1996 was particularly significant
                                 for police reform. In both cases, the peace accords stipulated the creation of new
                                 civilian police forces to replace the former police forces that had operated under
                                 the auspices of the military. In the years that followed, initiatives of police reform
                                 extended throughout the rest of the region. These processes of reform were strongly
                                 influenced by two main trends in international policing.

                              <p id="d1e154">On the one hand a COP model was adopted based on practices developed in North America
                                 and Europe during the 1980s. This model was strongly supported by multilateral institutions
                                 such as the Inter-American Development Bank, which saw the change as an appropriate
                                 path towards more democratic policing [<a href="#R14">14</a>]. COP aimed to deal with the causes of crime rather than simply responding to it-
                                 by empowering citizens, building police community partnerships, improving social services
                                 and generating better crime statistics [<a href="#R15">15</a>]. Street patrols, policy councils and youth services are some of the many programs
                                 adopted by Latin American COP models [<a href="#R15">15</a>]. In Latin America developments focused on COP were often paralleled by another trend
                                 towards professionalization and the formation of specialized units—sometimes with
                                 renewed linkages to the military. In response to public and media pressure and reactionary
                                 political leadership there has also been a tendency to resort to militarized responses.
                                 These initiatives rely on reactionary and repressive policies that seek immediate
                                 short-term results [<a href="#R16">16</a>].

                                 placed an emphasis on the professionalization of the police and engaged the armed
                                 forces in public security tasks. Its adoption of a COP model does, however, predate
                                 others in the region. Indeed, instead of an emphasis on force, technology and spending
                                 [<a href="#R17">17</a>], Nicaragua contrasts with other Latin American countries due to its long-term development
                                 of a model centered on state-community relations. According to the National Police
                                 its ethical aims of prevention and foundation in the community not only permeates
                                 the actions of individual police officers, but also guides the structure, organization,
                                 deployment and entire philosophy of the national police force [<a href="#R18">18</a>]. The Nicaraguan Police claim that it is the combination of <i>communitarian, preventive</i> and <i>proactive</i> policing that is at the foundation of its success in retaining order. Put simply
                                 it is in this way the police can work “from the community, for the community and with
                                 the community” [<a href="#R19">19</a>].

                                 in the country. Nicaragua registered its lowest homicide rate during the last 15 years

                                 is not only the result of moves towards professionalism sparked by the broader trend
                                 for COP in the 1990s, but also the result of several generations of change and reform
                                 [<a href="#R24">24</a>, <a href="#R25">25</a>, <a href="#R26">26</a>]. Secondary sources reviewed for this article also commonly connect the “communitarian”
                                 origins of the police force with the country’s experience of the Sandinista Revolution
                                 (1978–1990) [<a href="#R27">27</a>]. Whilst one of three Central American countries to pass through a period of civil
                                 war, Nicaragua is distinct from the others given that the Sandinistas not only managed
                                 to politically leverage a peace deal, but to militarily succeed in taking power through
                                 revolution. The success of the Sandinista Revolution in taking power and its introduction
                                 of a political system built on ideas of socialism are significant in providing an
                                 explanation for the basis for policing and security established in the post-conflict
                                 period. This also contrasts with the timing and origins of COP models adopted in the
                                 Northern Triangle. Although the ideological and religious basis of the government
                                 has been periodically challenged—both politically and through armed insurrection (Contras
                                 war 1981–1990)—the inheritance of ideas resulting from the Sandinista revolution remain
                                 evident in current political practice and dialogue.

                              <p id="d1e216">Cuadra [<a href="#R28">28</a>] highlights that before the triumph of the Sandinista Revolution, Nicaragua did not
                                 have an institution that assumed the functions of an independent police force. In
                                 the period of the Somoza government, the National Guard carried out these activities
                                 as part of its function to secure the internal order of the country; but without specialisation,
                                 political independence and the autonomy exercised by the military. It also lacked
                                 structure, organisation and clearly defined tasks in this regard. The National Guard
                                 is the immediate successor of the “Constabulary” that was created by the United States
                                 during their occupation of the country (1912–1933). The Constabulary was founded in
                                 1927 in the context of US intervention, as an armed body that fused together all policing
                                 and military functions. This apparatus continued for four years after the retraction
                                 of the US Marines (1937) and remained an institution loyal to the service of the governing
                                 Somoza regime.

                              <p id="d1e221">The defeat of the Anastasio Somoza dictatorship also marked the end of the National
                                 Guard, and their substitution by the Sandinista Popular Army and the Sandinista Police.
                                 The Sandinista Police were founded on the 5th of September 1979. With their establishment,
                                 the new government aimed to end the history of open repression carried out by the
                                 earlier National Guard. The first police officers of the new national force were mainly
                                 young people who had participated actively in the insurrection against the Somoza
                                 regime. Although very different from the National Guard, the new police force also
                                 submitted themselves to the governing class and their leadership. From 1979 onwards,
                                 the Sandinista government decided to separate the functions of defence and security
                                 from that of public order. This resulted in the creation of the Ministry of Defence
                                 and the Sandinista Popular Army; and the Ministry of the Interior and the Sandinista
                                 Police. The New Sandinista Police force initially counted on the advice and training
                                 of Panama, but its equipment and professional training drew mostly on socialist policy
                                 (and particularly the example of Cuba). From 1979 to 1989, the police force was formally
                                 tasked “to guarantee the status quo and property with revolutionary sentiment, confront
                                 crime and assist the task of securing the state” [<a href="#R28">28</a>].

                                    Revolution and local defence committees were initially structured to provide labour
                                    towards the construction and maintenance of basic services, water, light, the street
                                    etc. Following this they started with the distribution of basic food stuffs and efforts
                                    to defend the revolution through neighbourhood supervision”.</i>

                              <p id="d1e236">Throughout the 1980s the police formed part of the broad defence of the revolution
                                 in which they were assigned the task of preventing crime and counter-revolutionary
                                 activities. This was implemented with a strong emphasis on participation from the
                                 public. In response to the drastic economic measures adopted by the Nicaraguan government
                                 at the end of the 1980s and with the aim of counteracting the legacy of war, the Sandinista
                                 Police started a process of experimentation in which a significant reduction was made
                                 of its technical, human and material capacities. Significant cuts were made to the
                                 budgets of all parts of the state apparatus. At the same time there was an increase
                                 in the level of crime. This in turn influenced the capacity and attitude of the police
                                 force to exercise the functions with which it had been entrusted.

                              <p id="d1e238">With limited resources and personnel the Nicaraguan National Police (PNN) was forced
                                 to decentralise its responses to crime and manifestations of insecurity. It did this
                                 by establishing broad and permanent channels of communication with the community,
                                 both through the formation of community-assemblies and maintaining direct links with
                                 local residents. In the 1980s, the Nicaraguan police introduced two important elements
                                 of their current COP model i.e. committees for the defence of the revolution (<i>Comites por la defenda de la revolución</i>—later to become Committees for Citizen Power-CPCs) and <i>jefes de sector</i> (heads of sector). Whereas the committees would become a key point of articulation
                                 between the police and the families, the heads of sector would become specialists
                                 in public neighbourhood security.

                              <p id="d1e246">In 1989, the police force’s position in relation to the Ministry of the Interior was
                                 ratified by Law No.65 “Law of the Functions of the Sandinista Police” in which it
                                 was defined as an “organ of the Ministry of the Interior”. In contrast to its earlier
                                 formal remit to defend the state and popular revolution, the police were now tasked
                                 with the protection of the life and physical integrity of the country’s civilian inhabitants.
                                 They therefore assumed responsibility for the prevention of crime and preservation
                                 of public order. The police were also expected to embody the particular and social
                                 values of the country and to provide assistance to other state institutions to comply
                                 with the law and to carry out their legal obligations.

                              <p id="d1e248">In 1990s, following an intense process of transformation and institutional modernization,
                                 the relationship between the police and community was redefined yet again. It is important
                                 to note the coincidence of these changes with the election of the liberal Chamorro
                                 government (1990–1997). The Chamorro government rejected the socialist premise of
                                 the earlier government and of its efforts to organize the masses. During this process
                                 the National Police implemented the concept of public security as its principal doctrine
                                 and established the conception and philosophy of public service and prevention. As
                                 such the new model was, as one interviewee has commented, “aimed at 1. depoliticizing
                                 the national police and 2. removing party-based alliances”. The intentions of professionalization
                                 and modernisation of the police was further accompanied by an effort to strengthen
                                 human resources in organisational aspects, as well as improvements in candidate selection
                                 and training. In this period they also formally introduced a focus on gender equity
                                 as a crosscutting theme within the organization and actions of the National Police
                                 [<a href="#R30">30</a>]. In addition, the Police based their legal foundation on a newly reformed political
                                 constitution [<a href="#R31">31</a>]: “The National Police is a armed body of civil nature. It has as its mission the
                                 guarantee of internal order, the security of the citizenry, the prevention and prosecution
                                 of crime and other activities specified by law”. The police doctrine is founded clearly
                                 in the service of the community and signals that the work of the police only makes
                                 sense through its extensive relationship with it. The Law of the National Police defines
                                 clearly how to “secure exchanges and collaboration with different civil society organisations
                                 with an aim to the joint implementation of solutions to the problems faced by communities”
                                 [<a href="#R32">32</a>]. The Police further strengthened their relations with civil society and established
                                 further points of coordination on issues of crime prevention. Particular attention
                                 was given to the intra-family and sexual violence. This process culminated in the
                                 creation of the Mother and Child Stations. These stations were born out of a joint
                                 initiative between the civil society and the National Police, as spaces that provide
                                 integrated attention to the victims and survivors of intra-family and sexual violence.

                                 as a search for a better symmetry in relations between women and men within the institution,
                                 and the articulation of an increased role for women in police work [<a href="#R33">33</a>]. The process of professionalization of the national police in the 1990s also included
                                 the introduction of a programme aimed at the prevention of adolescent crime. In 1995
                                 the national police introduced a strategy targeting adolescent crime and related gang
                                 violence. In contrast to other Central American countries, adolescent crime was recognised
                                 not only an issue of public order, but as a social problem. The programme aimed to
                                 address the issue of adolescent crime not by force, but through a system of youth
                                 education and promotion. The police established a number of Centres of Youth Formation
                                 and Development (<i>Centros de Formación y Desarrollo Juvenil</i>) where adolescents identified by their families and the police were encouraged to
                                 enter vocational training programmes and a system of follow up and supervision by
                                 designated police officers [<a href="#R34">34</a>].

                              <p id="d1e271">These developments lead up to the formal introduction of the current Preventative
                                 Community Policing model. On the 20th November 2001, following Decree No 0426-2001,
                                 the Director General of the National Police, First Commander Edwin Cordero Ardila
                                 established the Integrated Police-Community Policy. This policy is conceived of as
                                 an instrument permitting the promotion of a change of attitude amongst members of
                                 the Police, and the facilitation of direct relations between the police and the community
                                 in order to achieve its institutional mission with increased efficiency and efficacy.
                                 Guido [<a href="#R35">35</a>] indicates that the stated aim of this policy is to contribute to the improvements
                                 of the quality of life of the population, and particularly with regards to citizens’
                                 security, guaranteeing the relationship between the institution of the police with
                                 the communities, putting in place preventative work and activities aimed at optimizing
                                 the quality of police services. The main features of the policy are based on the establishment
                                 of social relations connecting with the interests of different social groups in the
                                 community: the prevention of crime at the level of the community; a focus on gender
                                 and prevention amongst children and youths; respecting human rights and constitutional
                                 guarantees for individuals under police custody and their families [<a href="#R35">35</a>].

                              <p id="d1e279">In 2003 a further important ingredient of the current COP model was added. Family
                                 assemblies (Gabinetes de la Familia, la Comunidad y la Vida) would replace the earlier
                                 functions of the CPCs. According to official statistics there are now more than 100,000
                                 people within the network of “social prevention” constituted by the family assemblies
                                 and other related community assemblies [<a href="#R36">36</a>].

                              <p id="d1e284">The central goal of the current model is the operationalization, mainstreaming and
                                 integration of COP as a joint action in all areas of specialisation within the national
                                 police. It has its formal expression in the operative plans implemented at the level
                                 of sector, municipality, delegation and police district, and national level. The relationship
                                 between police and community is established principally through visits to homes, community
                                 and religious leaders, organizations for social education and protection of children
                                 and women, amongst others. It encourages the open participation of men and women and
                                 their proactive contribution in proposals for prevention and solution of different
                                 problems that affect their rights and freedoms.

                                    <p id="d1e289">Daniel Ortega, one of the key leaders of the insurrection against Somoza and the first
                                       post-revolution president in 1984, returned to the Presidency in 2007. In compliance
                                       with President Ortega’s orders, in July 2014 Nicaragua’s National Assembly approved
                                       a new law largely returning control over the country’s police force to the President.
                                       This move has sparked accusations by political opponents that the new law removes
                                       the institution’s independence and increases the risk of police corruption through
                                       political ties. The “Law of Organization, Functions, Career, and Special Regimen of
                                       Security of the National Police” makes the president “supreme commander” of the institution,
                                       alongside other clauses that restructure and provide institutional support for the
                                       police force. The legislation also replaces the National Police Law dating from 1996,
                                       under which the police fell under the control of Nicaragua’s Interior Ministry. The
                                       new laws eliminated the supervision and intermediation of the Interior Ministry (<i>Ministerio de Governación</i>)[<a href="#R37">37</a>], leaving the direction of the institution to be decided by the relationship between
                                       the leadership of the police and the president. This decision contradicted the previously
                                       agreed Framework for Democratic Security given that it removes any functional autonomy
                                       of the national police and any limitation in terms of their role in terms of protecting
                                       public security. It also contradicted the General Treaty on Democratic Security in
                                       Central America, in which there is clear emphasis on the need for an autonomous supervisory
                                       body to oversee the operation of the Police. As analysts recognized [<a href="#R38">38</a>], without the existence of such an authority or other suitable mechanisms of control
                                       and oversight, there is always the risk of an abuse of power and failure to protect
                                       the personal security of individuals.

                                    <p id="d1e300">In 2015 the Nicaraguan government also approved the establishment of a new Sovereign
                                       Security Act. The Act’s stated objective is to “preserve, promote, and maintain sovereign
                                       security” against threats that include transnational organized crime, international
                                       terrorism, foreign interference, criminality, rebellion, illicit acts against aviation
                                       and maritime navigation, attacks against cyber security and infrastructure, or “any
                                       illegal act that threatens against the existence of the Nicaraguan state and its institutions.”
                                       Whilst largely in support of the claims to defend sovereignty and territorial integrity,
                                       civil society organizations in the country fear that the new act is being misused
                                       by the presidency to outlaw the presence of certain non-governmental organizations
                                       in the country as well as restrict participation in the national democratic political
                                       system. The police’s use of force to stop and break up protests against the government
                                       or focused on issues such as the proposed canal are now characterized by government
                                       communications as necessary in the interest of pubic security and national strategic
                                       interest. Critics, however, suggest that something else is occurring [<a href="#R39">39</a>].

                                    <p id="d1e305">Roberto Cajina (a well known regional security analyst) in a recent blog-post suggests
                                       that the hard handed actions of the police forces in Managua represents “the profound
                                       systematic crisis in which the Police finds itself, in which the police are now denaturalized
                                       and converted into a body at the service of a dynastic project and the continuance
                                       of Daniel Ortega” [<a href="#R40">40</a>]. Further signs that democratic conditions are worsening include the way in which
                                       the government has used to the judicial system to ban the majority of the political
                                       opposition in the run up to elections in November 2016 [<a href="#R41">41</a>]. The fact that President Ortega positioned his wife as candidate for the vice-presidency
                                       has also given further fuel to arguments of the existence of nepotism and a worsening
                                       relationship between the state and community.

                                    <p id="d1e313">These changes indicate a general drift away from earlier democratic and revolutionary
                                       structures and ideas. There are also specific indications that resulting changes to
                                       everyday policing has had a direct impact on the possibility to sustain strong community
                                       linkages and public respect. Throughout the country there are falling rates of confidence
                                       in the police and public security. In interviews carried out in early 2017 analysts
                                       and ex-officials detailed at length a series of factors that demonstrated this falling
                                       confidence. Reports produced by research institutions highlight that whilst homicide
                                       rates remain comparatively low; public opinions regarding security and crime have
                                       changed. Critics also suggest the government’s use of homicide figures alone is misleading
                                       given that they do little as indicators of the status and quality of policing and

                                       for Strategic Study (IEEPP), the majority of people in the survey reported feeling
                                       safe in their neighbourhoods (only 1 in 10 did not) a series of significant concerns
                                       were raised [<a href="#R43">43</a>, <a href="#R44">44</a>]. The survey included 1,600 interviews with a broad spectrum of the public and was
                                       carried out across 56 municipalities in the country, including the Atlantic Coast.
                                       Robberies remained a concern (4 of 10), but there was a visible shift to the sectors
                                       this affects. There had been an increase of robberies taking place not only of homes
                                       but of businesses. The increasing level of drug use in Nicaraguan society has also
                                       been a significant concern (1 in 10). In 2013 there was an increasing level of traffic
                                       accidents and the lack of police presence was a problem. Also of note according to
                                       the survey was that of 100 hundred people experiencing a crime 49 will not have made
                                       an official report of its occurrence to the police. Many people responded that they
                                       did not report a crime because it would entail the loss of time and money, and that
                                       there is often poor response and follow up by the police.

                                       had not reported it the police [<a href="#R38">38</a>]. The explanations for this ranged between the low levels of seriousness of the crime,
                                       because it was a waste of money and time, the lack of attention and response of the
                                       police or fear of reprisals from criminals. Although the report highlights that confidence
                                       in the police remains comparatively high, negative perceptions were growing. Respondents
                                       to the survey with a negative perception had grown to what their annual report describes
                                       as an all time high of 16.9%. They also report that there is an increasing tendency

                                       institutional efficiency, is interpreted at least by some commentators as a politically
                                       motivated strategy by the Presidency to co-opt the popular support surrounding these
                                       programs. Interview respondents, including ex-police chiefs, commented in early 2017
                                       that this change was shortsighted given its effect on COP and the effective flow of
                                       information regarding local conditions of insecurity.

                              <p id="d1e347">Family assemblies and heads of sector are two of the distinctive feature of the Nicaraguan
                                 community-policing model. Indeed, it is these two features are largely recognized
                                 as enabling the Nicaraguan police’s claims to proactivity with and within the community.
                                 These “social technologies” also stand out in contrast with the more costly technologically
                                 driven and patrolling strategies used by other COP efforts in Central America.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e349">The family assemblies were established to renew and to continue the work of the earlier
                                 CPCs as participatory-mechanisms for the expression of popular concerns and interests.
                                 According to Article 290 of the 2013 Constitution the <i>gabinetes de familia</i> (Family assemblies) are organized by:
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e354">
                                 <i>“…individual adult men and women, teenagers and pensioner that live in a community,
                                    to reflect on and work together to promote values and family unity, self-confidence
                                    and mutual esteem, responsibilities, rights and obligations, communication, co-existence,
                                    understanding and a spirit of community so that they form coherence between how they
                                    think and act”.</i>

                              <p id="d1e359">By setting a schedule of regular meetings and workshops, the assemblies are meant
                                 to create spaces where a series of issues facing the community can be openly discussed
                                 and resolved i.e. health; education; sanitation; the promotion of local culture and
                                 religious festivals; citizens security; the promotion of the rights of women and children;
                                 the protection of families and their rights; the prevention and attention of violence
                                 against women, inter-family and youth violence; training and organization to confront
                                 natural disasters, promotion of community identity, and humanitarian assistance to
                                 cases of abandonment, disability and dementia. The family assemblies are widely seen
                                 by the people we interviewed as having a significant role in the solution and mediation
                                 of intra-familial violence.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e361">With regards to issues of crime and security in the community, the <i>gabinetes de familia</i> act as a point of direct articulation between community and the police. This is further
                                 facilitated through the direct participation in assembly meetings and seminars of
                                 the police’s own heads of sector (<i>jefe de sector</i>). These are community police officers that, in contrast to other Central American
                                 policing models, live in rather than just patrol local neighbourhoods and communities.
                                 Indeed, the <i>jefes de sectors</i> are often recruited from within the same community that they serve as a police officer.
                                 They cultivate close community ties through door-to-door visits with their neighbours
                                 and their participation in meetings with local residents. They also represent a point
                                 of articulation with the national police and the state. As such they ensure that information
                                 gathered from the community is passed directly up through the chain of command with
                                 the national force. As one sector head stated in a recent article “Our mission is
                                 to guarantee citizen’s security in all aspects, so that the people are at peace…and
                                 it is the jefe de sector that has the role of approaching both the police and the
                                 community, so that the community feels secure and knows to who they should turn in
                                 trying to resolve their problems” [<a href="#R47">47</a>].

                              <p id="d1e375">In addition to these two key features of the Nicaraguan policing model, proactivity
                                 in terms of the provision of quick responses to community concerns and interests has
                                 been aided by the operation of the Centres of Youth Formation and Development (<i>Centros de Formación y Desarrollo Juvenil</i>) in Managua and Bluefields—both cities with significant problems with juvenile crime
                                 (Rodgers 2013). The centres were set up by the national police in 2011 with the expressed
                                 intention of creating spaces to rescue young people who have become addicted to drugs
                                 or who had become involved in criminal activities and gangs. A series of international
                                 donors have supported these centres, including the Spanish government and the European
                                 Union. The Centres provide these young people with a place to stay, to take part in
                                 social and sporting activities, to learn about citizenship and to receive vocational
                                 training. During the opening ceremony for the Centre in Managua the First Commissioner
                                 of the National Police Aminta Granera commented [<a href="#R48">48</a>] on the role that the centres were to play:

                                    that it moves in unison with the feelings and life of the community. It is from there
                                    that it can privilege prevention, intimacy, and the protection of people in the community.
                                    The Youth Centres are the deepest and visible expression of this spirit of the Police,

                                    <p id="d1e391">Whilst these three elements of the Nicaraguan COP model are recognized as essential
                                       elements in the proactive response to crime, critics voice concerns about the way
                                       in which they also play a political role by embedding the Ortega Sandinista administration
                                       within the community. When the family assemblies (<i>Gabinetes de familia</i>) were introduced in 2013 several media channels and analysts highlighted that this
                                       was an attempt to impose a particular model of citizen control in the country. As
                                       mentioned above the family assemblies were meant to replace and update the role of
                                       the previous Citizens Power Councils. However, observers also noted that this really
                                       meant the formation of a closer relationship with the particular interests of Ortega,
                                       in contrast to a broader conception of deliberative democracy [<a href="#R49">49</a>]. Indeed, it was observed that the assemblies were part of a policy package initiated
                                       by the first lady, Ortega’s wife Rosario Murillo, termed <i>Vivir bien, vivir bonito, vivir sano</i> (Live well, live beautifully, live healthily). At the time of their introduction
                                       a deputy of the <i>Movimiento Renovador Sandinista</i> (MRS) was reported as saying that the assemblies:

                                          going to create more discrimination and exclusion compared to what there is at present”</i> [<a href="#R50">50</a>].

                                    <p id="d1e413">According to an opinion piece written for the La Prensa newspaper, although given
                                       legal validity by the Family Code (Código de la Familia) the assemblies “violate the
                                       principles of liberty, affecting rights and distorting the true conceptualization
                                       of citizens participation” [<a href="#R51">51</a>]. Although the national constitution emphasizes the freedom of religion and expression,
                                       according to paragraph 32 of the Code, the assemblies must aspire to Christian values,
                                       Socialist ideals and practices of solidarity. In listing the positive values of the
                                       assemblies another report emphasizes the manner in which the assemblies are formed
                                       to promote “Christian values, family values and unity, self-confidence and esteem
                                       for others, responsibility, rights and duties, communication and harmony” [<a href="#R52">52</a>]. Article 49 of the national constitution establishes the right of Nicaraguan citizens
                                       to organize on the basis of their willing participation and election of citizens,
                                       something that is in clear contrast to the specified form of behavior and principles
                                       written into the Family Code.

                                       interviews that the <i>Jefes de Sector</i> and <i>Centros de Juventud</i> might also operate as mechanisms to cultivate support for the Ortega administration.
                                       Some interview respondent voiced the opinion that whilst the Youth Centers played
                                       an important role in reducing youth crime they did not agree with the “political re-education”
                                       provided there.

                                    <p id="d1e429">With regards to the <i>jefes de sector</i> party alliances were more commonly connected with problems of institutional stagnation.
                                       Indeed, a number of interview respondents commented on the manner in which party alliances
                                       and control negatively affected the growth and professional development of the national
                                       police as a whole. Because the administration controlled appointments and promotions
                                       at the top and bottom of the police’s institutional structure a number of problematic
                                       tendencies could be observed. Party alliances meant that there was a high degree of
                                       circulation of the same people for top positions, and control over the acceptance
                                       of candidates into the role of <i>jefes de sector</i>. These alliances also meant that over time there was an over promotion of people
                                       at the top of the institution, and very little at the bottom (once in their role as
                                       jefes de sector police officers have little opportunity to move elsewhere in the institution)
                                       resulting in an overly top-heavy and aging leadership structure. Indeed, having reached
                                       the top there was commonly nowhere else for well-qualified people to go, as there
                                       was little emphasis placed on further education and specialization. As one ex-director
                                       of the national police commented in an interview with us “Nicaragua is now known in
                                       the region to have more leaders than followers, at the same time as wages at the upper
                                       level of the national police remain low compared to other countries in the region”.
                                       The ex-director also emphasized what he saw as a clear need for a generational shift
                                       in command in order to respond to the changing values and mindset of the population.
                                       Following the recent national security reforms, the regulations for appointments (Article
                                       47, Law 872) were changed allowing Aminta Granera to remain indefinitely in her position
                                       as First Commissioner of the National Police [<a href="#R53">53</a>]. Granera chose to leave her position as Police commisioner following the unrest
                                       in 2018.

                                       reflects the region’s contrasting history of indigenous ethnicity [<a href="#R58">58</a>], political alliances (the focus of the Contras struggle in the 80s) and largely
                                       separate and poorer economic circumstances to the rest of the country. The communities
                                       that make up the population [<a href="#R59">59</a>] of the Autonomous Atlantic Regions are located in territories—often with high ecologic
                                       and environmental vulnerability—with a strong sense of ownership of communal lands
                                       in coastal and forest areas. The creation of these regions created a new layer of
                                       government that would, at least in theory, grant greater “local” control to indigenous
                                       communities and traditional peoples over these regions and their natural resources.

                                       of the regional autonomous government”. The councils are entities created for deliberation,
                                       resolution, regional public policy formation and negotiation. The national police
                                       and the military retain however the role of the enforcement of law and order in the
                                       Autonomous regions in communication with these local authorities.

                                       by officials of the Nicaraguan state, the Autonomous Atlantic Regions have remained
                                       a zone of periodic violence, quite in contrast to the rest of the nation. Twenty one

                                       non-governmental organizations blame the violence on the increasing waves of settlers
                                       that have headed to the Atlantic coast because of severe droughts in the West of the

                                       widely recognized as a cause of recent unrest in the region [<a href="#R61">61</a>]. A study carried out at the beginning of 2015 by the Nicaraguan Network for Democracy
                                       signals that the construction of the canal would result in the displacement of more

                                       also acted as a magnet for people seeking employment and wealth. The law—based on
                                       a 2001 landmark case [<a href="#R62">62</a>]—requires outsiders, including the national government, to request permission from
                                       local authorities before they can buy or settle land. The violence has indicated that
                                       the law is not only being ignored, but that land has been taken by force. Importantly,
                                       it is also claimed that because of political linkages that exist between the government
                                       administration and the <i>colonos</i> (colonizers) the police and military have been instructed to not intervene in the
                                       conflicts. Some say that the National Sandinista Liberation Front is hoping to repopulate
                                       a region that was largely anti-Sandinista during the civil war in the 1980s, and gain
                                       access to valuable natural resources such as lumber and gold [<a href="#R63">63</a>]. Indigenous leaders claim that local functionaries of the government with connections
                                       to the timber companies have been assisting the colonizers to access automatic weapons

                                       an increasing number of people are reported by the local media to have been displaced
                                       from their ancestral lands. As a result many Nicaraguan families are reported to have

                              <p id="d1e489">The first voices critical of hard-line approaches in dealing with youth violence in
                                 Central America appeared in the late 1990s [<a href="#R65">65</a>]. Research supported by universities and NGOs questioned the effectiveness of reactive
                                 models in policing dealing with this problem. Of the Central American police institutions,
                                 the Nicaraguan police were the first to address the difficulties of a predominantly
                                 repressive approach toward youth violence in 2001 [<a href="#R65">65</a>]. Experience from the operation of a reactive approach, called <i>Plan de Pandillas</i> (Anti-gangs Plan) demonstrated that whilst successful in immediately reducing youth
                                 violence, it was less successful in delivering sustainability and legitimacy. It was
                                 argued that the <i>Plan de Pandillas</i> would not resolve the underlying causes of youth violence. On the contrary the reactive
                                 approach could turn the majority of the young and predominantly male adolescents into
                                 threats to security.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e503">In contrast to this experience, an alternative project was implemented by the local
                                 government in the nearby town of Masaya combining measures of crime control with prevention
                                 activities. The successful outcome of this project spread to other cities such as
                                 Jinotepe and Leon and would also become one of the foundations for the updating of
                                 citizens councils and the introduction of the family assemblies mentioned above [<a href="#R65">65</a>]. Also importantly with regards to the prevention of youth violence the project would
                                 result in the implementation of a broadly new strategy i.e. 1) an approach targeted
                                 to the criteria of different groups, 2) home visits to families with adolescents in
                                 risk groups, 3) organisation of civic work for youth at risk and 4) prevention activities
                                 at the community level. The Police also established a Directorate of Youth Affairs
                                 in 2003 at the national and departmental levels. It would be this Directorate that
                                 would also assume responsibility for the management of the Centres for Youth Training
                                 and Development—also mentioned above. This change towards an understanding that is
                                 <i>Más Vale Prevenir Que Reprimir</i> (Better to Prevent than Punish) is attributed with significant improvement in the
                                 indicators of youth violence in the country [<a href="#R66">66</a>]. The number of youth gangs recorded in Managua decreased from over 118 in 2002 to
                                 approximately 34 in 2005 [<a href="#R67">67</a>].

                              <p id="d1e517">In an interview in February 2017 [<a href="#R68">68</a>], (Now First) Commissioner General Xavier Davila Rueda made the claim that the operation
                                 of the <i>jefes de sector</i> were to a large degree responsible for preventing the spread of armed gangs and narcotics
                                 in Nicaraguan cities. They were key to the predictive and analytical capacity of the
                                 police. When attempts have been made by gangs and criminal cartels to establish themselves
                                 in communities the interaction between the sector heads and the family assemblies
                                 meant that they were immediately informed on, allowing for further targeted action
                                 by the national authorities to be taken. The <i>jefes de sector</i> represents in this way a low-tech mechanism with which to form human and low-cost
                                 lines of communication between the community and state authorities. Moreover they
                                 enable sensitivity by the police to the particular concerns of the local community
                                 such as robbery, drugs and delinquency. This is also significant given that the level
                                 of technical support to the Nicaraguan police—in rural areas in particular—is comparatively
                                 low (e.g. in my interviews with <i>jefes de sector</i> in Bluefields it became clear that police officers do not commonly carry radios,
                                 do not have regular access to information technologies, nor have designated motorised
                                 transport).

                                       Autonomous regions might not only be explained by dynamics of colonization and party
                                       alliances, but by the fact that the police are simply not sufficiently present in
                                       these areas of tension. According to a recent report there were 11,700 active personnel,

                                       inhabitants, which is low relative to the region, and significantly below the world
                                       average of 300 [<a href="#R70">70</a>]. The number of officers is up from 10,500 in 2010. Some 1,200 new officers entered
                                       the force in 2011, setting a record for the biggest expansion in a single year. According
                                       to news report from 2015, the size of the police force is currently at the level of

                                       police coverage is very low—including the rural areas of the Atlantic autonomous regions.
                                       According to the local police commissioner in Bluefields there are only 265 police

                                    <p id="d1e582">The placement of jefes de sector in rural communities assists the creation of a police
                                       presence, but it is also evident that many of these officers are incredibly isolated
                                       in terms of necessary back up when serious crime occurs. Left largely on their own
                                       within local communities it is possible—as some of our interview respondents suggested—that
                                       the jefes de sector are more susceptible to bribery and corruption, as well as the
                                       misuse of their position of power. Indeed, it is clearly possible that because of
                                       the low territorial coverage of the police in Nicaragua in many cases crime may go
                                       unregistered by the national authorities. In 2016 and the start of 2017 the national
                                       police presented a 15% reduction in the reporting of crime as a sign of their success.
                                       A direct correlation was made by the police command between reductions in reports
                                       of crime with a reduction in crime. However, as highlighted above, reports on citizen
                                       security carried out by independent analysts highlight the decrease in confidence
                                       that the public have in the police. It is suggested that the public have stopped reporting
                                       crime because the police fail to properly investigate and follow up on crime [<a href="#R72">72</a>].

                                    <p id="d1e587">Whereas the model for community based policing in Nicaragua has had significant success
                                       there are also signs that the national administration is encouraging a turn towards
                                       more heavy-handed tactics in an effort to make up for poor coverage. In rural areas
                                       the military have always had a role in the provision of security, and taken a particular
                                       role in combatting the transportation of narcotics along the Nicaraguan Atlantic coast.
                                       The presence of specially trained militarized police units have, however, also become
                                       increasingly evident in Managua and Bluefields. In the case of Managua this is officially
                                       a response to a number of violent crimes in the city [<a href="#R73">73</a>]. The police have now put into place the “Plan for the Strengthening of Security
                                       in the City of Managua” which according to official information is led by the <i>Directorate of Special Police Operations</i> (DOEP). It also involves the expanded use of the black uniformed <i>Dantos Brigade</i> in patrols and responses to reported violent crime in public spaces. According to
                                       a recent blog post by Roberto Cajina this is a sign that “the Police have lost their
                                       capacity to prevent and to be proactive, that they have lost their capacity to anticipate
                                       actions and guarantee the security of the population” [<a href="#R72">72</a>]. Law 872 of the National Police Law establishes that the DOEP is a specialized department
                                       of the Police that “corresponds with the intervention to restore public order in serious
                                       altercations, to participate in special operations against drug trafficking, terrorism,
                                       organized crime and other serious crimes”. This is first time that the DOEP has been
                                       tasked with the response to everyday crimes. According to Cajina this is “the unfolding
                                       of the police special forces in the application of a “heavy hand” policy in response
                                       to common crime” [<a href="#R72">72</a>].

                                    <p id="d1e604">The clear participation of the Dantos Brigade and the DOEP in the recent scenes of
                                       violence and police-community confrontations appears to support this argument. A series
                                       of protest were sparked in April 2018 following the decision by the Nicaraguan government
                                       to introduce cuts to pensions that would increase workers contributions and reduce
                                       overall benefits [<a href="#R74">74</a>]. Although the government would cancel the welfare reform in response to the initial
                                       unrest, protest has nonetheless spread largely because of the heavy handed police
                                       response and government administrations claims that protest was the result of political
                                       manipulation by opposition groups. On the Atlantic Coast anger also boiled over into
                                       violent protest due to the perceived failure of police and governmental response to
                                       wildfires in the Indio Maíz biosphere [<a href="#R75">75</a>]. Media coverage highlighted the presence of the black uniforms of the Dantos Brigade
                                       at the center of the violence both in the initial protests and multiple confrontations
                                       that would take place in Managua, Masaya and Bluefields in following weeks and months
                                       [<a href="#R76">76</a>]. There are no reports of the military having intervened in these confrontations
                                       [<a href="#R75">75</a>]. International and national media coverage has also emphasized the apparent alliance
                                       between the unit and balaclava clad para-police groups otherwise in civilian clothing.
                                       Media articles suggest that these para-police groups are civilian volunteers from
                                       the Sandinista FSLN party [<a href="#R77">77</a>]. The Nicaraguan government denies this [<a href="#R78">78</a>]. The government claims that these groups represent criminal and interventionist
                                       interests including the United States [<a href="#R77">77</a>]. It is these groups that are together attributed with the killing of c300 civilians
                                       [<a href="#R79">79</a>] and continuing threats made to community and opposition activists. This violence
                                       has in turn generated a wave of condemnation from the international community, including
                                       calls for the Nicaraguan government to call early elections and the US government’s
                                       proposal of a trade embargo of the country [<a href="#R80">80</a>, <a href="#R81">81</a>, <a href="#R82">82</a>].

                                    <p id="d1e640">For some of the leadership of the National Police the return to a more political,
                                       presidential and militarized form of policing is a return to its historic Sandinista
                                       identity. In contrast, Cajina suggests this is “self-deception” [<a href="#R83">83</a>]. He suggests that the National Police increasingly serve the President, and not
                                       the citizens. Even if there was a return to a more revolutionary ethos within the
                                       leadership of the national police, our interview respondents were also clear that
                                       it would no longer provide sufficient guidance to the force as a whole. A number of
                                       respondents made it clear that young people who are recruited into the police, including
                                       to work as <i>jefes de sector</i>, now had “more of an experience of poverty, than the ethics of the revolution”. This
                                       made it difficult for young recruits to relate to or “to learn from the sayings of
                                       their elders” (<i>aprender desde los dichos de sus mayores</i>). The formal requirements of the recruitment process to the National Police states
                                       that candidates must be a Nicaraguan citizen, be of honorable behavior and vocation,
                                       have a good reputation and prestige in the community where they reside, and not have
                                       any previous criminal record. It is, however, also recognized by the police that many
                                       of those attracted to join the police do so, not out of a desire to serve the community,
                                       but because of a shortage of other economic alternatives [<a href="#R84">84</a>].
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e654">These dynamics appear to suggest that the claims to preventative policing are under
                                       increasing pressure and contradiction. Indeed, regional dynamics in the Americas in
                                       general indicate that these pressures are likely to grow significantly in the years
                                       to come. The entire system of the Nicaraguan police is challenged by increasing efforts
                                       by the drug cartels and regionally based youth gangs to establish bridgeheads within
                                       the country, and within the Atlantic Autonomous regions in particular. Although geographically
                                       distant from Nicaragua the recent shift in the direction of US foreign policy and
                                       increased controls over immigration are also likely to end both the pressure valve
                                       of youth migration and remittances. With the disappearance of these opportunities
                                       tensions in the country are growing—particularly under the apparent current climate
                                       of presidentialism—and an increasing number of young people are pushed to either join
                                       criminal activities or join the police force out of necessity rather than conviction.

                              <p id="d1e659">With its low levels of homicide and violent crime Nicaragua stands in strong contrast
                                 with the countries of the Northern Triangle. As has been discussed above, it is evident
                                 that the Nicaraguan model for community based policing (COP) has contributed significantly
                                 to these conditions. The Nicaraguan model for COP differed from others in the region
                                 due to its rejection of reactive policing and development of a system that emphasizes
                                 <i>communitarian, proactive and preventative</i> goals. Through the use of these guiding values and institutional structures the Nicaraguan
                                 COP model has until very recently depended much more on “social capital” (networks
                                 of relationships between people among people who live in a particular society), than
                                 other Central American COP models where high levels of financing, numbers of personnel
                                 and electronic information technology play a greater role [<a href="#R85">85</a>]. The Nicaraguan COP model still carries some of the revolutionary ideals of Sandinista
                                 history. These are put into practice through the formation of a series of specific
                                 institutional structures, key amongst which are the family assemblies (<i>gabinetes de familia</i>), the sector or neighborhood officers (<i>jefes de sector</i>) and youth centers (<i>centros de formación y desarrollo juvenil</i>). Through these structures the national police were able to not only generate a strong
                                 contact with the local community, but ensure the rapid exchange of information regarding
                                 crime and local development concerns. They also enabled the police to proactively
                                 identify particular threats at an earlier stage and efficiently intervene to prevent
                                 and remove these risks. This has been particularly effective in containing the spread
                                 of youth gangs and organized criminal cartels attempting to operate in urban centres
                                 on Nicaragua soil.

                              <p id="d1e676">Whilst in this way we corroborate earlier claims regarding the success of the Nicaraguan
                                 COP model, we also recognize that this model is currently under erosion. Changing
                                 circumstances make claims that it represents an example of good practice in public
                                 security increasingly untenable. The extraordinary violence and public unrest of recent
                                 months demonstrate that trust between the police and community, and the government
                                 and community are no longer what they once were. Public opinion regarding citizen’s
                                 security and the efficiency of the police appears to be changing. Homicide levels
                                 are down according to official police statistics, but other reports suggest that robbery
                                 and drug related crime is growing in the cities. Whilst less crime is reported, indicators
                                 also suggest that fewer people trust the police to follow up on reported crime. It
                                 is also clear that the Ortega government recent efforts to bolster presidential power
                                 by restraining political opposition in parliament, by quelling public protest in the
                                 streets and by placing a series of public institutions directly under its control
                                 has had an impact on public trust in the state and police. As a result of the institutional
                                 changes made by the government, the police now have a permanent first commissioner
                                 and many of its social programmes, such as with women, removed from their control.
                                 Whilst the government argues for this in terms of bureaucratic efficiency, the removal
                                 of these responsibilities from the police has also removed vital points of communication
                                 with the community. The key institutional mechanisms mentioned above continue to function,
                                 but increasing critique is made of the way in which the Ortega government’s particular
                                 brand of ideology i.e. Sandinismo mixed with conservative Catholicism, has intervened
                                 in their operation. Whilst there has been a long process to bolster professionalism
                                 in the national police, the tendency to promote some officers on the basis of party
                                 loyalties has resulted in an overly top-heavy leadership structure that it is little
                                 interested in innovation or renewal. Party alliance appears to be proactively replacing
                                 democratic communitarianism as the defining characteristic of who receives attention
                                 from these instances.

                              <p id="d1e678">Concurrent with a politically driven erosion of police professionalism, it is also
                                 evident that there are a series of challenges to the Nicaraguan COP model’s claims
                                 to be proactive and preventative. Indeed, it appears that issue of political alliances
                                 is at least a feature of the growing inability of the national police to respond to
                                 the growing levels of violence and insecurity developing in the Atlantic Autonomous
                                 Regions. In this context the police not only appear partisan, but are also failing
                                 to actively prevent rising tensions and further conflict. Certainly there seems to
                                 be a persisting gap in cultural and political respect and understanding between authorities
                                 in Managua and customary defined authorities of the Autonomous Regions. As we have
                                 described above, whilst the <i>jefes de sector</i> have had considerable success in urban areas, the low numbers of police in general
                                 and their frequent isolation with little technical and logistical back-up in rural
                                 areas is also a cause for concern. Claims of the involvement of <i>jefes de sector</i> in corruption and the misuse of power need to be taken seriously, particularly if
                                 this also takes on a partisan character.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e686">The move by the national police to rely on specially trained armed units can also
                                 be seen as a politically driven move away from preventative policing. Whilst argued
                                 on the basis of a necessary reactive response to a recent rise in violent crime, the
                                 appearance of these units on neighbourhood patrols and civil protests has added further
                                 to the perception of institutional crisis and a politically driven attack on the foundational
                                 democratic values and action goals of the police. This has never been more evident
                                 than now in the context of current violent confrontations between the Dantos Brigade,
                                 para-police and community and opposition organizations. Indeed, as the institutional
                                 structures stagnate because of political favouritism, there is an increasing gap between
                                 the revolutionary rhetoric of its upper command with the actions and lived reality
                                 of economic hardship and exclusion experienced by both those newly drawn into its
                                 ranks and the community amongst which it aims to win hearts and minds. Changing regional
                                 conditions do not make this situation any easier. At a time when democracy is constrained,
                                 socio-economic differences are worsening and police presence is low and increasingly
                                 lacking in trust, it is becoming easier for the gangs and criminal cartels to solidly
                                 establish themselves in Nicaragua. The Nicaraguan model of community policing has
                                 functioned well under previous moments of extreme stress, such as the Contras struggle,
                                 but the institutional conditions surrounding its anchorage in the state and community
                                 have changed significantly.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e688">Taken together these conclusions suggest that in a search for a critical foundation
                                 for human security—one not only concerned with public order, but public well-being—Nicaragua
                                 needs to end the drift away from the original principles established for its model
                                 of community based policing. This we suggest should include reconsideration of the
                                 sociological and democratic foundations of the models original principles i.e. policing
                                 not in service of an authoritarian government but of service to and integration within
                                 the community. The effort to place these principles in practice serve as an explanation
                                 of the country’s success in limiting crime in the past despite extremely challenging
                                 socio-economic conditions. The current government’s apparent departure from adherence
                                 to these principles is at least part of the negative tendencies and current failures
                                 in policing. The model’s, albeit now more historic than current emphasis on community
                                 or “social capital” also provides Nicaraguans, and perhaps populations beyond its
                                 borders, with a reminder that there are significant alternatives. In other contexts,
                                 analysts make a similar point in stating that an increase in public order policing
                                 will not help. In response to a context of social public order gone wrong the police
                                 need to become complicit or partisan towards the citizens that they serve [<a href="#R86">86</a>]. Indeed, as has been more obvious in the current national crisis, the history of
                                 COP in Nicaragua makes evident that there are alternatives to the dominant regional
                                 trends of policing [<a href="#R87">87</a>, <a href="#R88">88</a>] e.g. that emphasize centralized leadership, militarization and an over reliance
                                 on the use of expensive technologies (information, communication, monitoring, weaponry
                                 etc.) at the expense of trust and human security.

                                          out with financing from the EU Horizon 2020 ICT4COP project. The research included
                                          a series of field visits and semi-structured interviews with a range of police personnel,
                                          ex-police officials, public officials, academics, representatives of community and
                                          civil society organizations. Research was conducted in both the capital Managua and
                                          Bluefields on the Atlantic Coast. Every effort was made to secure responses from as
                                          wide a cross sec- tion of respondents as possible. Secondary academic and media sources
                                          have also been extensively used. Given the sensitivities of the Nicaraguan state to
                                          questions regarding internal security this research would not have been possible without
                                          formal acceptance of research activity by the National Police and the Nicaraguan Ministry
                                          of Foreign Affairs. This approval open doors to important respondents within state
                                          institutions, but admittedly also created some limits to our correspondence with members
                                          of the political opposition in the country.
