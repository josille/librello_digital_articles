                                 which fundamentally undermines their human security. For individuals who wish to remain
                                 in their isolated communities for family, religious, philosophical or other reasons,
                                 their attachment to their communities creates a disincentive for higher education.
                                 This promotes low educational achievement, which in turn results in low socioeconomic
                                 status, lack of social mobility, and a generational cycle of poverty. The human misery
                                 that results from such a feedback loop is observed in isolated communities throughout
                                 North America, including aboriginal communities in Canada. Fortunately, maturation
                                 of information and communication technologies now offers individuals the potential
                                 to gain high-skilled employment while living in an isolated community, using both
                                 (i) virtual work/remote work and (ii) remote training and education. To examine that
                                 potential, this study: 1) categorizes high-skill careers that demand a higher education
                                 and are widely viable for remote work, 2) examines options for obtaining the required
                                 education remotely, and 3) performs an economic analysis of investing in remote education,
                                 quantifying the results in return on investment. The results show that the Internet
                                 has now opened up the possibility of both remote education and remote work. Though
                                 the investment in college education is significant, there are loans available and
                                 the return on investment is generally far higher than the interest rate on the loans.
                                 The results identified several particularly promising majors and dozens of high-income
                                 careers. The ability to both obtain an education and employment remotely offers the
                                 potential to lift many people living in isolated communities out of poverty, reduce
                                 inequality overall, and provide those living in isolated communities with viable means
                                 of employment security, which not only allows personal sustainability, but also the
                                 potential for personal growth.</span></div>

                              <p id="d1e134">A reliable form of employment is currently one of the central tenets of human security
                                 [<a href="#R01">1</a>, <a href="#R02">2</a>, <a href="#R03">3</a>, <a href="#R04">4</a>, <a href="#R05">5</a>]. Lack of employment opportunities leads to extreme poverty of indigenous people
                                 living in isolated communities throughout the world including the Pacific [<a href="#R06">6</a>], former British colonies [<a href="#R07">7</a>], and the Americas, Australasia, South East Asia, Europe, and Russia [<a href="#R08">8</a>]. In addition, a poverty of opportunities exists in isolated communities even within
                                 well-developed nations for common citizens like those in the United States. For example,
                                 in the upper peninsula of Michigan, during the last recession, unemployment rates
                                 topped 25% [<a href="#R09">9</a>], and the undercounting of unemployment in the U.S. is well established [<a href="#R10">10</a>, <a href="#R11">11</a>]. Education is important for ending a poverty of opportunity, as it is critical for
                                 self-empowerment and increasing the prospects of employment, higher wages, and social
                                 mobility [<a href="#R12">12</a>, <a href="#R13">13</a>, <a href="#R14">14</a>, <a href="#R15">15</a>]. For individuals who wish to remain in their isolated communities for family, religious,
                                 philosophical, or other reasons, often there are simply not enough jobs with living
                                 wages available. For example, in Canada, all Aboriginal identity groups have substantially
                                 lower incomes than the general population [<a href="#R16">16</a>], and their attachment to their communities creates poor incentive for higher education,
                                 thus promoting low educational achievement, which, in turn, results in low socioeconomic
                                 status [<a href="#R17">17</a>]. For the young people committed to staying in their isolated communities for personal
                                 reasons, if there are few (or no) jobs that require higher education, there is no
                                 incentive for them to obtain this education and the cycle of poverty continues generationally.

                                 potential to gain high-skilled employment through remote work (also called telework,
                                 virtual work, or distributed work) [<a href="#R18">18</a>, <a href="#R19">19</a>, <a href="#R20">20</a>, <a href="#R21">21</a>, <a href="#R22">22</a>, <a href="#R23">23</a>, <a href="#R24">24</a>, <a href="#R25">25</a>, <a href="#R26">26</a>, <a href="#R27">27</a>, <a href="#R28">28</a>, <a href="#R29">29</a>, <a href="#R30">30</a>, <a href="#R31">31</a>, <a href="#R32">32</a>, <a href="#R33">33</a>, <a href="#R34">34</a>, <a href="#R35">35</a>, <a href="#R36">36</a>, <a href="#R37">37</a>].

                                 the ability to acquire a vast array of types of training and education remotely [<a href="#R38">38</a>, <a href="#R39">39</a>, <a href="#R40">40</a>, <a href="#R41">41</a>, <a href="#R42">42</a>, <a href="#R43">43</a>, <a href="#R44">44</a>, <a href="#R45">45</a>, <a href="#R46">46</a>, <a href="#R47">47</a>, <a href="#R48">48</a>, <a href="#R49">49</a>, <a href="#R50">50</a>]. By coupling these two Internet-enabled opportunities, a complete solution of employment
                                 in an isolated region is possible. There have been many studies of online education
                                 (e.g. [<a href="#R38">38</a>, <a href="#R39">39</a>, <a href="#R40">40</a>, <a href="#R41">41</a>, <a href="#R42">42</a>, <a href="#R43">43</a>, <a href="#R44">44</a>, <a href="#R45">45</a>, <a href="#R46">46</a>, <a href="#R47">47</a>, <a href="#R48">48</a>, <a href="#R49">49</a>, <a href="#R50">50</a>, <a href="#R51">51</a>]) and remote work (e.g. [<a href="#R18">18</a>, <a href="#R19">19</a>, <a href="#R20">20</a>, <a href="#R21">21</a>, <a href="#R22">22</a>, <a href="#R23">23</a>, <a href="#R24">24</a>, <a href="#R25">25</a>, <a href="#R26">26</a>, <a href="#R27">27</a>, <a href="#R28">28</a>, <a href="#R29">29</a>, <a href="#R30">30</a>, <a href="#R31">31</a>, <a href="#R32">32</a>, <a href="#R33">33</a>, <a href="#R34">34</a>, <a href="#R35">35</a>, <a href="#R36">36</a>, <a href="#R37">37</a>, <a href="#R52">52</a>]), as well as studies about the general advantages of extending Internet into remote
                                 areas (e.g. [<a href="#R53">53</a>]). However, this study is unique in that it explores the interaction of online education
                                 and remote work as a complete package for people in isolated communities who do not
                                 wish to relocate.

                              <p id="d1e409">To examine the potential of distance learning and remote work to enable secure employment
                                 for individuals in isolated communities, this study: 1) categorizes high-skill careers
                                 that demand a higher education, which are widely viable for remote work and 2) examines
                                 options for obtaining the required education remotely. The results are discussed and
                                 conclusions are drawn to help guide policy makers and educators in providing isolated
                                 communities with viable means of employment security.

                              <p id="d1e414">A list of careers was generated and categorized that represented high-skill careers
                                 that require a higher education. Only permanent jobs were considered, as opposed to
                                 the typically temporary unskilled jobs that are frequently found on digital freelance
                                 websites (e.g. Freelancer, Fiverr, FlexJobs, Elance, Guru and oDesk). This list was
                                 then reduced by eliminating all career paths that could not be accomplished remotely
                                 because of physical/hands-on curriculum requirements. The list was further refined
                                 to jobs for which the education needed to complete them could be found remotely with
                                 existing universities requiring a four-year degree. Finally, the list was further
                                 refined by eliminating all jobs with a sinking market due to technology (e.g. journalists,
                                 translators, legal assistants, and travel agents) and jobs that were highly competitive
                                 (e.g. authors and artists), as a career could not be reasonably guaranteed having
                                 completed a degree. Then the list was matched with the top affordable online universities
                                 in the U.S. by degree type [<a href="#R54">54</a>]. Next, the total degree cost was calculated assuming 120 credit hours and 4 years
                                 (accreditation policies) [<a href="#R55">55</a>, <a href="#R56">56</a>, <a href="#R57">57</a>, <a href="#R58">58</a>], though not taking into account university associated fees. Each career was matched
                                 with tuition cost, wage, and accreditation, and is shown in Table <a href="#Tab2">2</a>. All monetary values are given in USD. The data from Tables <a href="#Tab2">2</a> and <a href="#Tab1">1</a> are used to determine the economic benefits of obtaining a university degree remotely
                                 that would enable one to work remotely. The estimates are conservative, as they assume
                                 that the student is only attending to their education full- time and avoiding all
                                 high-school diploma level work while earning their degree. The opportunity cost (foregone
                                 wages during college) is assumed to be at the mean wage for high school wages for
                                 ages 18 to 24: about $23,000 in the U.S. [<a href="#R59">59</a>], which again is a conservative assumption, as most entry level workers do not receive
                                 this wage. Over the 4 years of college, this results in $92,000 of opportunity cost.
                                 This is larger than any of the tuition costs considered as seen in Table <a href="#Tab2">2</a>. In most cases, the very simple analysis of return on investment equaling the reciprocal
                                 of the payback time yields a reasonable approximation. However, a rigorous, full cash
                                 flow analysis is more accurate. This is performed assuming a 2% per year raise due
                                 to experience, and a 2% per year raise due to economic growth (adjusted for inflation).
                                 This is applied to the high school wage as well, which currently has a median of $33,000
                                 per year for all working ages [<a href="#R60">60</a>] and the mean is 1.2 times larger [<a href="#R59">59</a>].

                                    </span> is the working time to payback the investment. For instance, with a career length
                                 of 40 years and a payback time of 15 years, the ROI would be about 6%. Assuming that
                                 the increased income is actually adjusted for inflation, meaning that the income without
                                 the higher education rises with inflation, and the income with the higher education
                                 rises with inflation, this ROI is actually adjusted for inflation. If this investment
                                 is compared in nominal terms (e.g. not adjusted for inflation) it would be closer
                                 to an 8% return on investment, which is normally considered excellent.

                                 because the fact that there is a delay between the invested money and getting a return
                                 becomes more important. However, for long payback times, the rigorous analysis gives
                                 a higher return. This is because economic growth becomes significant over these longer
                                 times.

                                    <p id="d1e1779">The concept of the payback time is widely used to evaluate investments: this is the
                                       time required to pay back the initial investment. In this case, the initial investment
                                       is the tuition and the income foregone during the time of getting the degree (opportunity
                                       cost). Since it is assumed that the student stays at home, there would not be an additional
                                       room and board cost relative to having a job that does not require higher education.
                                       The payback framework generally assumes that there is initial investment at one point
                                       in time and then a money savings beginning immediately thereafter. In the case of
                                       a college education, it typically takes four years and that is the degree evaluated
                                       here. This makes the payback time longer than the time actually spent working to pay
                                       back the education costs. However, even adjusted for inflation, wages tend to increase
                                       (this is economic growth). This is especially true for jobs that require a college
                                       education. Since a payback framework assumes that education garners an increase in
                                       salary that is constant over time, the real case tends to shorten the equivalent payback
                                       time. These factors roughly cancel out. Therefore, the simple approximation of the
                                       payback time equaling the time required working to pay back the cost of education
                                       is used. P is the principal investment, S is the savings per year, and P/S is the
                                       working time to payback the investment. When put in these terms, many people require
                                       a very short payback of only a few years [<a href="#R75">75</a>]. However, there are some circumstances when education can take longer to pay back.
                                       Therefore, a more helpful metric to evaluate the investment is the return on investment
                                       (ROI). Most people are familiar with this metric because it is equivalent to an interest
                                       rate on a savings account or a loan. As can be seen by the results shown in Table
                                       <a href="#Tab3">3</a>, all but three jobs (tax preparer, event planner, and brokerage clerk), not only
                                       had positive ROIs, but were deep into the double digits of return. For example, software
                                       developers can expect to earn over a 30% ROI every year over their entire careers
                                       while working at home and having been trained remotely. This again is a conservative
                                       estimate and will be discussed in the risk section below as part of the unquestionable
                                       benefit for the graduate to have made the investment in education. To make this clearer,
                                       a case study will be presented that illustrates the pathway.

                                    <p id="d1e1790">Consider a hypothetical case of a young Inuit couple living in Nunavut in a close
                                       knit, isolated community that they do not want to leave. Unfortunately, the community
                                       is depressed and has few local job prospects. The ongoing economic challenge of dependence
                                       on expensive diesel fuel for electricity and the slow uptake of renewable energy [<a href="#R76">76</a>, <a href="#R77">77</a>] has limited the ability of the people in Nunavut to address other issues, including
                                       housing shortages, inadequate health services, and perhaps most importantly, under-funded
                                       education [<a href="#R78">78</a>, <a href="#R79">79</a>, <a href="#R80">80</a>, <a href="#R81">81</a>, <a href="#R82">82</a>]. Fortunately, QINIQ, a Canadian company, has begun to use a combination of satellite
                                       and wireless communications technology to provide broadband Internet service to 25
                                       remote communities in the Canadian territory of Nunavut [<a href="#R83">83</a>]. Using this access, the couple began to dabble in coding, using free online resources
                                       that teach computer programming. They started at the grade school level with Scratch,
                                       a tool developed by Lifelong Kindergarten group at MIT Media Lab [<a href="#R84">84</a>] and then moved on to progressively more complicated coding at code.org, which is
                                       a non-profit dedicated to expanding participation in computer science by making it
                                       available in more schools and expanding participation by women and underrepresented
                                       students of color [<a href="#R85">85</a>]. The husband became interested in pure computer science and decided to pursue his
                                       degree from Fort Hays State University, while the wife was more interested in software
                                       programming and targeted an online degree from University of Southern Mississippi.
                                       They would need to invest about $22,000 and $44,000 for their respective degrees,
                                       but upon completion, he could expect to make over $113,000 per year and she would
                                       make over $54,000 per year, bringing their family income to over $168,000, if they
                                       both chose to work full-time. This is roughly three times the median income for families
                                       living in Nunuvut and much greater than those living in isolated communities, in general
                                       [<a href="#R86">86</a>]. It should be noted that the cost of living in northern communities, such as in
                                       this example, is significantly higher than those living in more temperate regions.
                                       Assuming full time work, their ROIs would be 26% for her and 35% for him on their
                                       investment in their education. He could gain employment at a company like IBM, because
                                       even employees who live nearby to an office rarely come to work physically, because
                                       they use the avatar interaction software, Second Life [<a href="#R87">87</a>]. She might work for herself as a consultant providing freelance coding services.
                                       This arrangement gives them both the flexibility to continue living in their remote
                                       community, enough work-life balance to start and support a family, and a high enough
                                       income to live well and propagate higher education and higher wages for their children.
                                       In addition, as they can work from home, they can reduce their work-related expenses
                                       to computers and broadband access, completely eliminate commute time, as well as numerous
                                       and diverse other work related expenses, and garner time, monetary, and environmental
                                       benefits, as well. Furthermore, much of their money would be spent locally, providing
                                       additional local employment.

                                    <p id="d1e1833">Based on the benefits to the individuals and the community as a whole (discussed in
                                       section 4.5), communities may want to proactively invest to assist individuals in
                                       obtaining a higher education and the remote employment that demands it; specifically,
                                       by providing high speed internet services. However, many jobs could possibly be done
                                       without high-speed Internet, because real-time conversations can be accomplished over
                                       the phone, while emails and videos can download over time. The exception would be
                                       if screen sharing or videoconferencing is required. In addition, many educational
                                       offerings still do not rely on video. In summation, although it may be possible that
                                       distance education be achieved without high-speed Internet, it would be a benefit,
                                       and for particular types of educational resources and jobs, a necessity. An example
                                       of a community already doing this is Manning, Iowa. It has a population of 1500, but
                                       it installed high-speed Internet and has attracted alumni to come back to telecommute
                                       [<a href="#R88">88</a>].
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e1838">Thus, several policies can be implemented in isolated communities to foster distributed
                                       education and employment. First, free public libraries providing both a physical location
                                       and an educational foundation to support a learning community should be supported.
                                       These libraries can act as hubs for individuals who do not have access to the computers
                                       or the Internet connections needed to gain an education (which will itself enable
                                       the individual to afford these in the future for employment). Second, offering personal,
                                       free high-speed Internet access for all citizens should be a goal for all communities,
                                       but is particularly important for isolated communities with a smaller fraction of
                                       their population with any personal Internet access. Many people do not have the financial
                                       means of computer access and this barrier can be addressed through one or more of
                                       the following: 1) community-supported information technology (IT) access, 2) donations
                                       and charity, 3) community and individual loans, and 4) reliance on free and open source
                                       hardware and software. This latter approach can radically reduce the IT infrastructure
                                       costs. For example, an open source, credit-card-sized computer such as the Raspberry
                                       Pi costs under $40 and can be made into a fully functional computer with discarded
                                       components (e.g. keyboard, mouse, and display). Similarly, outdated, Windows based
                                       computers can be salvaged from scrap yards and revitalized with Linux-based operating
                                       systems for free, significantly improving their performance and making them useful
                                       for Internet-based education.

                                    <p id="d1e1843">There are several risks when discussing this approach, due to the fundamental limitation
                                       of this paper, which is an implicit reliance on the ceteris paribus fallacy (i.e.
                                       the assumption that external variables will remain constant, while factors that include

                                       job that requires a college degree [<a href="#R89">89</a>]. As reported by the Washington Post [<a href="#R90">90</a>], this implies that obtaining a college level education is of questionable merit.
                                       However, this implication has two major flaws. First, university degrees offer graduates
                                       a wide selection of jobs that may not focus directly on their major. For example,
                                       a physics major may get a job as a computer programmer or even a game designer, and
                                       a rudimentary analysis would infer s/he was not employed in her/his field. A deeper
                                       analysis would uncover that many modern video/computer games, for example, have complex
                                       physics engines to ensure realistic game play [<a href="#R91">91</a>]. More importantly, it is clear from U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data that college
                                       graduates are far more likely to have jobs, make more money, and overall have better
                                       self efficacy in the economy [<a href="#R60">60</a>]. So, for example, a job like a tax preparer does not absolutely demand a college
                                       degree, but having one makes the potential employee far more likely to acquire the
                                       job and be able to hold on to the job in a poor economy. The reality is that individuals
                                       are far better off with college degrees than without, even if they are not employed
                                       in positions directly related to their specific major.

                                    <p id="d1e1857">The second major risk, from an individual’s perspective, is the potential for competition,
                                       either domestically (what if everyone in America started to use this approach?) or
                                       internationally. Today, on websites like Freelancer, there are already incredibly
                                       talented artists, programmers, and writers, for example, that are willing to work
                                       for what would be considered exceptionally low wages in the U.S. Thomas Friedman notes
                                       in “The World is Flat” that native English speakers will still have an advantage in
                                       the near-term. However, in the medium term, there is likely to be a talented, polite,
                                       professional, English-speaking middle-class coming out of countries like India who
                                       will be incredibly competitive in the online job market [<a href="#R92">92</a>]. Having a diploma will help U.S. citizens compete, and there will still be the opportunity
                                       to gain an even more valuable bachelor’s or graduate degree as prestigious institutions
                                       offer more online training. It should be pointed out here that the opportunities provided
                                       by an online education are particularly helpful to people outside of well-developed
                                       North American economies. The model provided here is applicable to anyone living in
                                       an isolated community anywhere on Earth who has the drive to complete the academic
                                       requirements, the capital to invest in an appropriate online education (or ability
                                       to acquire a loan), and the technical means to access it. In many ways, the results
                                       presented here are the worst-case scenario, as the analysis is based on the U.S. educational
                                       system, which has exorbitant fees because of a combination of weak government support,
                                       administrative bloat, and excessive administrative compensation packages [<a href="#R93">93</a>].
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e1865">This last point leads to a third risk of unintended consequences. Corporate-based
                                       administrative thinking favors online education because of the scalability, cost savings,
                                       and the continued erosion of faculty autonomy [<a href="#R93">93</a>]. Encouraging this trend, then, has the moral hazard of de-evolving university education
                                       to simple job training (as is common with for-profit online only educational institutes).
                                       This would further weaken the educational foundation and critical thinking skills
                                       needed in the populace for effective citizenship in a democracy, and undermine the
                                       academic freedom of university professors to challenge authorities and the paradigms
                                       that propagate inequality and human insecurity.

                                    <p id="d1e1870">Even with continued changes to both the global economy and the global environment,
                                       human security is enhanced with education. First, the global economy is shifting,
                                       as more low-skill jobs are automated. In the last few decades, automation and off-shoring
                                       in developed countries has focused mainly on middle skill jobs, i.e. the middle class.
                                       It is forecasted that future automation will continue to eliminate some middle skill
                                       jobs (and even some higher skill jobs), but the majority of the loss will be of low
                                       skilled jobs [<a href="#R94">94</a>]. For example, Baxter, a $22,000 robot that can be trained by grabbing its arms and
                                       showing it what to do, can easily replace much unskilled human labor [<a href="#R95">95</a>]. In their seminal paper on the potential for the future automation of jobs, Frey
                                       and Osborne found that, although 47% of U.S. employment is at risk from near-term
                                       automation, educational attainment exhibits a strong relationship with the unlikeliness
                                       of computerization. This means that getting a college education in remote areas will
                                       become even more important in the future than it is now. It is true that higher degrees
                                       of automation and distributed manufacturing with 3-D printing has the potential to
                                       create jobs, but as Pistono has pointed out, often jobs created by technology employ
                                       a small fraction of the people previously employed [<a href="#R96">96</a>]. Furthermore, these new jobs require a high level of education, flexibility, intelligence,
                                       and entrepreneurship [<a href="#R96">96</a>]. In addition, many of the new tasks created by automation can only be handled with
                                       additional automation [<a href="#R95">95</a>]. Of course, there are some jobs that currently require a college degree that are
                                       likely to be automated, like legal assistants and even journalists. Readers are advised
                                       to consult the Appendix of Frey and Osborne on near-term decisions. For example, the
                                       probability of automation for real estate sales agents is 86%, which should be taken
                                       into account when considering the relatively high ROI calculated in Table 3. In addition,
                                       the probability of automation of medical and clinical laboratory technologists is
                                       90%, insurance sales agents is 92%, tax examiners, collectors, and revenue agents
                                       is 93%, and accountants and auditors is 94%. Therefore, caution purely from a financial
                                       perspective, is recommended for people pursuing these careers. Lastly, as continued
                                       climate destabilization occurs because of fossil fuel-related pollution [<a href="#R97">97</a>], the global economy will be significantly affected [<a href="#R98">98</a>] and individuals will want to mitigate their personal career risk. For example, education
                                       for long-term careers associated with the coal industry are of highly questionable
                                       utility due to both the changes occurring in the industry now [<a href="#R99">99</a>] and potential liabilities related to climate change [<a href="#R100">100</a>, <a href="#R101">101</a>, <a href="#R102">102</a>].
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e1906">Despite these risks, it is clear from this study that with careful selection and attainment
                                       of online training and education, specifically with a focus on a high ROI, it is possible
                                       to obtain remote employment in an isolated community. In addition to the economic
                                       benefits for the individual in any remote community in obtaining a higher education
                                       and the concomitant income, there are also benefits to the community. These benefits
                                       are less straight forward to quantify. For example, the presence of a highly educated
                                       individual (e.g. a civil engineer) in an isolated community is likely to contribute
                                       to the community’s human security in complex and synergistic ways, quite independent
                                       of the engineer’s own economic welfare or “payback time”. Such an engineer might provide
                                       quantitative reasoning that would be useful in community decisions made by municipalities,
                                       help avoid scams, or improve a community’s sustainability performance. Similarly,
                                       a critical mass of highly educated individuals in a remote community who value education
                                       for their children’s community can change the educational atmosphere in schools to
                                       improve the outcomes in future generations. It has also been found that people with
                                       higher levels of education are more likely to become entrepreneurs [89], thus providing
                                       additional benefits and jobs for people in the community who are not able to obtain
                                       higher education themselves. Educated people will also be able to help elevate others
                                       in their communities by forwarding/motivating a higher education philosophy, acting
                                       as mentors, roll models, and academic and career advisors, writing letters of recommendation
                                       to universities, etc. This is particularly important for those living in aboriginal
                                       communities where individuals do not generally have contacts external to the community.
                                       The availability, and certainly the free access to the Internet, can provide an almost
                                       unlimited amount of valuable information and education outside of specific degrees
                                       of study, such as health, economy, ecology, politics, etc. Future work is needed in
                                       this area to provide more quantitative values of these benefits.

                              <p id="d1e1911">People wishing to remain in remote communities have traditionally been disadvantaged
                                 economically, socially, and politically. However, the Internet has now opened up the
                                 possibility of both remote education and remote work. Though the investment in college
                                 education is significant, education loans are generally available, and the return
                                 on investment is generally far higher than the interest rate on the loans, or any
                                 other type of traditional and typical economic investment vehicle. This study has
                                 identified several particularly promising majors and dozens of high-income careers.
                                 The ability to obtain both an education and employment remotely offers the potential
                                 to bring many people living in isolated communities out of poverty, reduce inequality
                                 overall, and provide those communities with viable means of employment security, now,
                                 and in the future.
