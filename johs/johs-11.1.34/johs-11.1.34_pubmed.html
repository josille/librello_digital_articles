                     which fundamentally undermines their human security. For individuals who wish to remain
                     in their isolated communities for family, religious, philosophical or other reasons,
                     their attachment to their communities creates a disincentive for higher education.
                     This promotes low educational achievement, which in turn results in low socioeconomic
                     status, lack of social mobility, and a generational cycle of poverty. The human misery
                     that results from such a feedback loop is observed in isolated communities throughout
                     North America, including aboriginal communities in Canada. Fortunately, maturation
                     of information and communication technologies now offers individuals the potential
                     to gain high-skilled employment while living in an isolated community, using both
                     (i) virtual work/remote work and (ii) remote training and education. To examine that
                     potential, this study: 1) categorizes high-skill careers that demand a higher education
                     and are widely viable for remote work, 2) examines options for obtaining the required
                     education remotely, and 3) performs an economic analysis of investing in remote education,
                     quantifying the results in return on investment. The results show that the Internet
                     has now opened up the possibility of both remote education and remote work. Though
                     the investment in college education is significant, there are loans available and
                     the return on investment is generally far higher than the interest rate on the loans.
                     The results identified several particularly promising majors and dozens of high-income
                     careers. The ability to both obtain an education and employment remotely offers the
                     potential to lift many people living in isolated communities out of poverty, reduce
                     inequality overall, and provide those living in isolated communities with viable means
                     of employment security, which not only allows personal sustainability, but also the
                     potential for personal growth.

            <p id="d1e134">A reliable form of employment is currently one of the central tenets of human security
               [<a href="#R01">1</a>, <a href="#R02">2</a>, <a href="#R03">3</a>, <a href="#R04">4</a>, <a href="#R05">5</a>]. Lack of employment opportunities leads to extreme poverty of indigenous people
               living in isolated communities throughout the world including the Pacific [<a href="#R06">6</a>], former British colonies [<a href="#R07">7</a>], and the Americas, Australasia, South East Asia, Europe, and Russia [<a href="#R08">8</a>]. In addition, a poverty of opportunities exists in isolated communities even within
               well-developed nations for common citizens like those in the United States. For example,
               in the upper peninsula of Michigan, during the last recession, unemployment rates
               topped 25% [<a href="#R09">9</a>], and the undercounting of unemployment in the U.S. is well established [<a href="#R10">10</a>, <a href="#R11">11</a>]. Education is important for ending a poverty of opportunity, as it is critical for
               self-empowerment and increasing the prospects of employment, higher wages, and social
               mobility [<a href="#R12">12</a>, <a href="#R13">13</a>, <a href="#R14">14</a>, <a href="#R15">15</a>]. For individuals who wish to remain in their isolated communities for family, religious,
               philosophical, or other reasons, often there are simply not enough jobs with living
               wages available. For example, in Canada, all Aboriginal identity groups have substantially
               lower incomes than the general population [<a href="#R16">16</a>], and their attachment to their communities creates poor incentive for higher education,
               thus promoting low educational achievement, which, in turn, results in low socioeconomic
               status [<a href="#R17">17</a>]. For the young people committed to staying in their isolated communities for personal
               reasons, if there are few (or no) jobs that require higher education, there is no
               incentive for them to obtain this education and the cycle of poverty continues generationally.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e189">Fortunately, maturation of information and communication technologies now offers the
               potential to gain high-skilled employment through remote work (also called telework,
               virtual work, or distributed work) [<a href="#R18">18</a>, <a href="#R19">19</a>, <a href="#R20">20</a>, <a href="#R21">21</a>, <a href="#R22">22</a>, <a href="#R23">23</a>, <a href="#R24">24</a>, <a href="#R25">25</a>, <a href="#R26">26</a>, <a href="#R27">27</a>, <a href="#R28">28</a>, <a href="#R29">29</a>, <a href="#R30">30</a>, <a href="#R31">31</a>, <a href="#R32">32</a>, <a href="#R33">33</a>, <a href="#R34">34</a>, <a href="#R35">35</a>, <a href="#R36">36</a>, <a href="#R37">37</a>]. This allows individuals to have rewarding and high compensation employment while
               living in an isolated community. In addition, online and distance education enable
               the ability to acquire a vast array of types of training and education remotely [<a href="#R38">38</a>, <a href="#R39">39</a>, <a href="#R40">40</a>, <a href="#R41">41</a>, <a href="#R42">42</a>, <a href="#R43">43</a>, <a href="#R44">44</a>, <a href="#R45">45</a>, <a href="#R46">46</a>, <a href="#R47">47</a>, <a href="#R48">48</a>, <a href="#R49">49</a>, <a href="#R50">50</a>]. By coupling these two Internet-enabled opportunities, a complete solution of employment
               in an isolated region is possible. There have been many studies of online education
               (e.g. [<a href="#R38">38</a>, <a href="#R39">39</a>, <a href="#R40">40</a>, <a href="#R41">41</a>, <a href="#R42">42</a>, <a href="#R43">43</a>, <a href="#R44">44</a>, <a href="#R45">45</a>, <a href="#R46">46</a>, <a href="#R47">47</a>, <a href="#R48">48</a>, <a href="#R49">49</a>, <a href="#R50">50</a>, <a href="#R51">51</a>]) and remote work (e.g. [<a href="#R18">18</a>, <a href="#R19">19</a>, <a href="#R20">20</a>, <a href="#R21">21</a>, <a href="#R22">22</a>, <a href="#R23">23</a>, <a href="#R24">24</a>, <a href="#R25">25</a>, <a href="#R26">26</a>, <a href="#R27">27</a>, <a href="#R28">28</a>, <a href="#R29">29</a>, <a href="#R30">30</a>, <a href="#R31">31</a>, <a href="#R32">32</a>, <a href="#R33">33</a>, <a href="#R34">34</a>, <a href="#R35">35</a>, <a href="#R36">36</a>, <a href="#R37">37</a>, <a href="#R52">52</a>]), as well as studies about the general advantages of extending Internet into remote
               areas (e.g. [<a href="#R53">53</a>]). However, this study is unique in that it explores the interaction of online education
               and remote work as a complete package for people in isolated communities who do not
               wish to relocate.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e409">To examine the potential of distance learning and remote work to enable secure employment
               for individuals in isolated communities, this study: 1) categorizes high-skill careers
               that demand a higher education, which are widely viable for remote work and 2) examines
               options for obtaining the required education remotely. The results are discussed and
               conclusions are drawn to help guide policy makers and educators in providing isolated
               communities with viable means of employment security.

               <!-- named anchor --></a><h2 class="main-title">2.- Methods</h2>
            <p id="d1e414">A list of careers was generated and categorized that represented high-skill careers
               that require a higher education. Only permanent jobs were considered, as opposed to
               the typically temporary unskilled jobs that are frequently found on digital freelance
               websites (e.g. Freelancer, Fiverr, FlexJobs, Elance, Guru and oDesk). This list was
               then reduced by eliminating all career paths that could not be accomplished remotely
               because of physical/hands-on curriculum requirements. The list was further refined
               to jobs for which the education needed to complete them could be found remotely with
               existing universities requiring a four-year degree. Finally, the list was further
               refined by eliminating all jobs with a sinking market due to technology (e.g. journalists,
               translators, legal assistants, and travel agents) and jobs that were highly competitive
               (e.g. authors and artists), as a career could not be reasonably guaranteed having
               completed a degree. Then the list was matched with the top affordable online universities
               in the U.S. by degree type [<a href="#R54">54</a>]. Next, the total degree cost was calculated assuming 120 credit hours and 4 years
               (accreditation policies) [<a href="#R55">55</a>, <a href="#R56">56</a>, <a href="#R57">57</a>, <a href="#R58">58</a>], though not taking into account university associated fees. Each career was matched
               with tuition cost, wage, and accreditation, and is shown in Table <a href="#Tab2">2</a>. All monetary values are given in USD. The data from Tables <a href="#Tab2">2</a> and <a href="#Tab1">1</a> are used to determine the economic benefits of obtaining a university degree remotely
               that would enable one to work remotely. The estimates are conservative, as they assume
               that the student is only attending to their education full- time and avoiding all
               high-school diploma level work while earning their degree. The opportunity cost (foregone
               wages during college) is assumed to be at the mean wage for high school wages for
               ages 18 to 24: about $23,000 in the U.S. [<a href="#R59">59</a>], which again is a conservative assumption, as most entry level workers do not receive
               this wage. Over the 4 years of college, this results in $92,000 of opportunity cost.
               This is larger than any of the tuition costs considered as seen in Table <a href="#Tab2">2</a>. In most cases, the very simple analysis of return on investment equaling the reciprocal
               of the payback time yields a reasonable approximation. However, a rigorous, full cash
               flow analysis is more accurate. This is performed assuming a 2% per year raise due
               to experience, and a 2% per year raise due to economic growth (adjusted for inflation).
               This is applied to the high school wage as well, which currently has a median of $33,000
               per year for all working ages [<a href="#R60">60</a>] and the mean is 1.2 times larger [<a href="#R59">59</a>].

               of 40 years and a payback time of 15 years, the ROI would be about 6%. Assuming that
               the increased income is actually adjusted for inflation, meaning that the income without
               the higher education rises with inflation, and the income with the higher education
               rises with inflation, this ROI is actually adjusted for inflation. If this investment
               is compared in nominal terms (e.g. not adjusted for inflation) it would be closer
               to an 8% return on investment, which is normally considered excellent.

            <p id="d1e1405">The payback analysis is summarized in Table <a href="#Tab3">3</a>. For the short payback times, the rigorous method yields lower returns on investment
               because the fact that there is a delay between the invested money and getting a return
               becomes more important. However, for long payback times, the rigorous analysis gives
               a higher return. This is because economic growth becomes significant over these longer
               times.

               <p id="d1e1779">The concept of the payback time is widely used to evaluate investments: this is the
                  time required to pay back the initial investment. In this case, the initial investment
                  is the tuition and the income foregone during the time of getting the degree (opportunity
                  cost). Since it is assumed that the student stays at home, there would not be an additional
                  room and board cost relative to having a job that does not require higher education.
                  The payback framework generally assumes that there is initial investment at one point
                  in time and then a money savings beginning immediately thereafter. In the case of
                  a college education, it typically takes four years and that is the degree evaluated
                  here. This makes the payback time longer than the time actually spent working to pay
                  back the education costs. However, even adjusted for inflation, wages tend to increase
                  (this is economic growth). This is especially true for jobs that require a college
                  education. Since a payback framework assumes that education garners an increase in
                  salary that is constant over time, the real case tends to shorten the equivalent payback
                  time. These factors roughly cancel out. Therefore, the simple approximation of the
                  payback time equaling the time required working to pay back the cost of education
                  is used. P is the principal investment, S is the savings per year, and P/S is the
                  working time to payback the investment. When put in these terms, many people require
                  a very short payback of only a few years [<a href="#R75">75</a>]. However, there are some circumstances when education can take longer to pay back.
                  Therefore, a more helpful metric to evaluate the investment is the return on investment
                  (ROI). Most people are familiar with this metric because it is equivalent to an interest
                  rate on a savings account or a loan. As can be seen by the results shown in Table
                  <a href="#Tab3">3</a>, all but three jobs (tax preparer, event planner, and brokerage clerk), not only
                  had positive ROIs, but were deep into the double digits of return. For example, software
                  developers can expect to earn over a 30% ROI every year over their entire careers
                  while working at home and having been trained remotely. This again is a conservative
                  estimate and will be discussed in the risk section below as part of the unquestionable
                  benefit for the graduate to have made the investment in education. To make this clearer,
                  a case study will be presented that illustrates the pathway.

               <p id="d1e1790">Consider a hypothetical case of a young Inuit couple living in Nunavut in a close
                  knit, isolated community that they do not want to leave. Unfortunately, the community
                  is depressed and has few local job prospects. The ongoing economic challenge of dependence
                  on expensive diesel fuel for electricity and the slow uptake of renewable energy [<a href="#R76">76</a>, <a href="#R77">77</a>] has limited the ability of the people in Nunavut to address other issues, including
                  housing shortages, inadequate health services, and perhaps most importantly, under-funded
                  education [<a href="#R78">78</a>, <a href="#R79">79</a>, <a href="#R80">80</a>, <a href="#R81">81</a>, <a href="#R82">82</a>]. Fortunately, QINIQ, a Canadian company, has begun to use a combination of satellite
                  and wireless communications technology to provide broadband Internet service to 25
                  remote communities in the Canadian territory of Nunavut [<a href="#R83">83</a>]. Using this access, the couple began to dabble in coding, using free online resources
                  that teach computer programming. They started at the grade school level with Scratch,
                  a tool developed by Lifelong Kindergarten group at MIT Media Lab [<a href="#R84">84</a>] and then moved on to progressively more complicated coding at code.org, which is
                  a non-profit dedicated to expanding participation in computer science by making it
                  available in more schools and expanding participation by women and underrepresented
                  students of color [<a href="#R85">85</a>]. The husband became interested in pure computer science and decided to pursue his
                  degree from Fort Hays State University, while the wife was more interested in software
                  programming and targeted an online degree from University of Southern Mississippi.
                  They would need to invest about $22,000 and $44,000 for their respective degrees,
                  but upon completion, he could expect to make over $113,000 per year and she would
                  make over $54,000 per year, bringing their family income to over $168,000, if they
                  both chose to work full-time. This is roughly three times the median income for families
                  living in Nunuvut and much greater than those living in isolated communities, in general
                  [<a href="#R86">86</a>]. It should be noted that the cost of living in northern communities, such as in
                  this example, is significantly higher than those living in more temperate regions.
                  Assuming full time work, their ROIs would be 26% for her and 35% for him on their
                  investment in their education. He could gain employment at a company like IBM, because
                  even employees who live nearby to an office rarely come to work physically, because
                  they use the avatar interaction software, Second Life [<a href="#R87">87</a>]. She might work for herself as a consultant providing freelance coding services.
                  This arrangement gives them both the flexibility to continue living in their remote
                  community, enough work-life balance to start and support a family, and a high enough
                  income to live well and propagate higher education and higher wages for their children.
                  In addition, as they can work from home, they can reduce their work-related expenses
                  to computers and broadband access, completely eliminate commute time, as well as numerous
                  and diverse other work related expenses, and garner time, monetary, and environmental
                  benefits, as well. Furthermore, much of their money would be spent locally, providing
                  additional local employment.

                  <!-- named anchor --></a><h3 class="section-title">4.3.- Community Preparation for Distributed Education and Employment</h3>
               <p id="d1e1833">Based on the benefits to the individuals and the community as a whole (discussed in
                  section 4.5), communities may want to proactively invest to assist individuals in
                  obtaining a higher education and the remote employment that demands it; specifically,
                  by providing high speed internet services. However, many jobs could possibly be done
                  without high-speed Internet, because real-time conversations can be accomplished over
                  the phone, while emails and videos can download over time. The exception would be
                  if screen sharing or videoconferencing is required. In addition, many educational
                  offerings still do not rely on video. In summation, although it may be possible that
                  distance education be achieved without high-speed Internet, it would be a benefit,
                  and for particular types of educational resources and jobs, a necessity. An example
                  of a community already doing this is Manning, Iowa. It has a population of 1500, but
                  it installed high-speed Internet and has attracted alumni to come back to telecommute
                  [<a href="#R88">88</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1838">Thus, several policies can be implemented in isolated communities to foster distributed
                  education and employment. First, free public libraries providing both a physical location
                  and an educational foundation to support a learning community should be supported.
                  These libraries can act as hubs for individuals who do not have access to the computers
                  or the Internet connections needed to gain an education (which will itself enable
                  the individual to afford these in the future for employment). Second, offering personal,
                  free high-speed Internet access for all citizens should be a goal for all communities,
                  but is particularly important for isolated communities with a smaller fraction of
                  their population with any personal Internet access. Many people do not have the financial
                  means of computer access and this barrier can be addressed through one or more of
                  the following: 1) community-supported information technology (IT) access, 2) donations
                  and charity, 3) community and individual loans, and 4) reliance on free and open source
                  hardware and software. This latter approach can radically reduce the IT infrastructure
                  costs. For example, an open source, credit-card-sized computer such as the Raspberry
                  Pi costs under $40 and can be made into a fully functional computer with discarded
                  components (e.g. keyboard, mouse, and display). Similarly, outdated, Windows based
                  computers can be salvaged from scrap yards and revitalized with Linux-based operating
                  systems for free, significantly improving their performance and making them useful
                  for Internet-based education.

                  <!-- named anchor --></a><h3 class="section-title">4.4.- Risks and Benefits</h3>
               <p id="d1e1843">There are several risks when discussing this approach, due to the fundamental limitation
                  of this paper, which is an implicit reliance on the ceteris paribus fallacy (i.e.
                  the assumption that external variables will remain constant, while factors that include
                  the global environment and the global economy are in flux). First, will the person
                  be able to get the intended job? A 2014 study found that only 27% of college graduates
                  are in a job that matches their major and that only 62% of college grads are in a
                  job that requires a college degree [<a href="#R89">89</a>]. As reported by the Washington Post [<a href="#R90">90</a>], this implies that obtaining a college level education is of questionable merit.
                  However, this implication has two major flaws. First, university degrees offer graduates
                  a wide selection of jobs that may not focus directly on their major. For example,
                  a physics major may get a job as a computer programmer or even a game designer, and
                  a rudimentary analysis would infer s/he was not employed in her/his field. A deeper
                  analysis would uncover that many modern video/computer games, for example, have complex
                  physics engines to ensure realistic game play [<a href="#R91">91</a>]. More importantly, it is clear from U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data that college
                  graduates are far more likely to have jobs, make more money, and overall have better
                  self efficacy in the economy [<a href="#R60">60</a>]. So, for example, a job like a tax preparer does not absolutely demand a college
                  degree, but having one makes the potential employee far more likely to acquire the
                  job and be able to hold on to the job in a poor economy. The reality is that individuals
                  are far better off with college degrees than without, even if they are not employed
                  in positions directly related to their specific major.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1857">The second major risk, from an individual’s perspective, is the potential for competition,
                  either domestically (what if everyone in America started to use this approach?) or
                  internationally. Today, on websites like Freelancer, there are already incredibly
                  talented artists, programmers, and writers, for example, that are willing to work
                  for what would be considered exceptionally low wages in the U.S. Thomas Friedman notes
                  in “The World is Flat” that native English speakers will still have an advantage in
                  the near-term. However, in the medium term, there is likely to be a talented, polite,
                  professional, English-speaking middle-class coming out of countries like India who
                  will be incredibly competitive in the online job market [<a href="#R92">92</a>]. Having a diploma will help U.S. citizens compete, and there will still be the opportunity
                  to gain an even more valuable bachelor’s or graduate degree as prestigious institutions
                  offer more online training. It should be pointed out here that the opportunities provided
                  by an online education are particularly helpful to people outside of well-developed
                  North American economies. The model provided here is applicable to anyone living in
                  an isolated community anywhere on Earth who has the drive to complete the academic
                  requirements, the capital to invest in an appropriate online education (or ability
                  to acquire a loan), and the technical means to access it. In many ways, the results
                  presented here are the worst-case scenario, as the analysis is based on the U.S. educational
                  system, which has exorbitant fees because of a combination of weak government support,
                  administrative bloat, and excessive administrative compensation packages [<a href="#R93">93</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1865">This last point leads to a third risk of unintended consequences. Corporate-based
                  administrative thinking favors online education because of the scalability, cost savings,
                  and the continued erosion of faculty autonomy [<a href="#R93">93</a>]. Encouraging this trend, then, has the moral hazard of de-evolving university education
                  to simple job training (as is common with for-profit online only educational institutes).
                  This would further weaken the educational foundation and critical thinking skills
                  needed in the populace for effective citizenship in a democracy, and undermine the
                  academic freedom of university professors to challenge authorities and the paradigms
                  that propagate inequality and human insecurity.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1870">Even with continued changes to both the global economy and the global environment,
                  human security is enhanced with education. First, the global economy is shifting,
                  as more low-skill jobs are automated. In the last few decades, automation and off-shoring
                  in developed countries has focused mainly on middle skill jobs, i.e. the middle class.
                  It is forecasted that future automation will continue to eliminate some middle skill
                  jobs (and even some higher skill jobs), but the majority of the loss will be of low
                  skilled jobs [<a href="#R94">94</a>]. For example, Baxter, a $22,000 robot that can be trained by grabbing its arms and
                  showing it what to do, can easily replace much unskilled human labor [<a href="#R95">95</a>]. In their seminal paper on the potential for the future automation of jobs, Frey
                  and Osborne found that, although 47% of U.S. employment is at risk from near-term
                  automation, educational attainment exhibits a strong relationship with the unlikeliness
                  of computerization. This means that getting a college education in remote areas will
                  become even more important in the future than it is now. It is true that higher degrees
                  of automation and distributed manufacturing with 3-D printing has the potential to
                  create jobs, but as Pistono has pointed out, often jobs created by technology employ
                  a small fraction of the people previously employed [<a href="#R96">96</a>]. Furthermore, these new jobs require a high level of education, flexibility, intelligence,
                  and entrepreneurship [<a href="#R96">96</a>]. In addition, many of the new tasks created by automation can only be handled with
                  additional automation [<a href="#R95">95</a>]. Of course, there are some jobs that currently require a college degree that are
                  likely to be automated, like legal assistants and even journalists. Readers are advised
                  to consult the Appendix of Frey and Osborne on near-term decisions. For example, the
                  probability of automation for real estate sales agents is 86%, which should be taken
                  into account when considering the relatively high ROI calculated in Table 3. In addition,
                  the probability of automation of medical and clinical laboratory technologists is
                  90%, insurance sales agents is 92%, tax examiners, collectors, and revenue agents
                  is 93%, and accountants and auditors is 94%. Therefore, caution purely from a financial
                  perspective, is recommended for people pursuing these careers. Lastly, as continued
                  climate destabilization occurs because of fossil fuel-related pollution [<a href="#R97">97</a>], the global economy will be significantly affected [<a href="#R98">98</a>] and individuals will want to mitigate their personal career risk. For example, education
                  for long-term careers associated with the coal industry are of highly questionable
                  utility due to both the changes occurring in the industry now [<a href="#R99">99</a>] and potential liabilities related to climate change [<a href="#R100">100</a>, <a href="#R101">101</a>, <a href="#R102">102</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1906">Despite these risks, it is clear from this study that with careful selection and attainment
                  of online training and education, specifically with a focus on a high ROI, it is possible
                  to obtain remote employment in an isolated community. In addition to the economic
                  benefits for the individual in any remote community in obtaining a higher education
                  and the concomitant income, there are also benefits to the community. These benefits
                  are less straight forward to quantify. For example, the presence of a highly educated
                  individual (e.g. a civil engineer) in an isolated community is likely to contribute
                  to the community’s human security in complex and synergistic ways, quite independent
                  of the engineer’s own economic welfare or “payback time”. Such an engineer might provide
                  quantitative reasoning that would be useful in community decisions made by municipalities,
                  help avoid scams, or improve a community’s sustainability performance. Similarly,
                  a critical mass of highly educated individuals in a remote community who value education
                  for their children’s community can change the educational atmosphere in schools to
                  improve the outcomes in future generations. It has also been found that people with
                  higher levels of education are more likely to become entrepreneurs [89], thus providing
                  additional benefits and jobs for people in the community who are not able to obtain
                  higher education themselves. Educated people will also be able to help elevate others
                  in their communities by forwarding/motivating a higher education philosophy, acting
                  as mentors, roll models, and academic and career advisors, writing letters of recommendation
                  to universities, etc. This is particularly important for those living in aboriginal
                  communities where individuals do not generally have contacts external to the community.
                  The availability, and certainly the free access to the Internet, can provide an almost
                  unlimited amount of valuable information and education outside of specific degrees
                  of study, such as health, economy, ecology, politics, etc. Future work is needed in
                  this area to provide more quantitative values of these benefits.

            <p id="d1e1911">People wishing to remain in remote communities have traditionally been disadvantaged
               economically, socially, and politically. However, the Internet has now opened up the
               possibility of both remote education and remote work. Though the investment in college
               education is significant, education loans are generally available, and the return
               on investment is generally far higher than the interest rate on the loans, or any
               other type of traditional and typical economic investment vehicle. This study has
               identified several particularly promising majors and dozens of high-income careers.
               The ability to obtain both an education and employment remotely offers the potential
               to bring many people living in isolated communities out of poverty, reduce inequality
               overall, and provide those communities with viable means of employment security, now,
               and in the future.
