                                 that mobilise for armed struggle, by focusing on the case of the Maoist movement in
                                 Nepal. Feminist scholarship has highlighted how left-wing populism, when appealing
                                 to a generalized “people”, tend to produce homogenizing discourses that erase inequalities
                                 and difference, even when such movements integrate a gender dimension. Examining the
                                 trajectory of the Maoist movement over time, we argue that this ‘sameness’ may become
                                 contested and utilized by women participating in the lower echelons of the movement,
                                 as the political reality shifts from conflict to post-conflict context. As our main
                                 contribution, we develop a bi-directional approach that employs the concept of collective
                                 identity and allows us to examine the construction of populist agendas as a two-way
                                 interaction between the leadership of a movement and its grass roots supporters. Through
                                 this approach we show how the gender dimension was not merely a bi-product but central
                                 to both the construction of the Maoist movement’s war time ‘progressive’ identity,
                                 and the fragmentation of this identity and the movement’s populist appeal in the post-conflict
                                 context.</span></div>

                              <p id="d1e112">With the rise in right-wing populist movements globally, there is increasing scholarly
                                 interest in this area. However, less attention has been paid to left-wing populist
                                 movements that contribute to the mobilization of marginalized groups for armed struggle,
                                 and within the existing scholarship, left-wing populism in South Asia remains particularly
                                 under-explored [<a href="#R1">1</a>]. Left-wing populist movements that propagate armed violence tend to rely on ideologies
                                 constructed on radical agendas of social and progressive transformation to make sense
                                 of and justify their means, frequently including a gender dimension [<a href="#R2">2</a>]. Building on critical feminist scholarship on populism, we explore this gender dimension
                                 not as an ‘add-on’ to the ideologies of left-wing, violent populist movements, but
                                 as a key factor in defining a populist movement in its left-wing or ‘progressive’
                                 orientation (see for example: [<a href="#R3">3</a>, <a href="#R4">4</a>, <a href="#R5">5</a>, <a href="#R6">6</a>, <a href="#R7">7</a>, <a href="#R8">8</a>]). We argue that the gender dimension plays a crucial role in both constructing the
                                 identity of a populist movement and determining the support it can garner and retain
                                 over time.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e139">Concurring with feminist scholarship on left-wing populism we recognize how populist
                                 movements rely on a position of ‘sameness’ when appealing to a generalized ‘people’,
                                 resulting in erasing differences and inequalities <i>within</i> the ‘in-group’ [<a href="#R9">9</a>, <a href="#R10">10</a>, <a href="#R11">11</a>]. However, our innovation in adding to this scholarship is to question how women
                                 contribute to, as well as contest, the gender agendas of such movements, including
                                 a movement’s potentially homogenizing rhetoric? In addressing this question, we develop
                                 a bi-directional approach that examines the construction of populist agendas as a
                                 two-way interaction between the leadership of a movement and its grass roots supporters.
                                 Taking this approach, we draw on the concept of ‘collective identity’ in understanding
                                 the construction and fragmentation of a populist movement over time, centring on the
                                 transition from conflict to post-conflict [<a href="#R10">10</a>, <a href="#R12">12</a>]. A bi-directional approach allows us then to examine how women both contribute to
                                 the development of the gender agenda and contest rhetorical homogenization at different
                                 stages of the conflict, affecting the movement’s populist appeal over time [<a href="#R13">13</a>, <a href="#R14">14</a>, <a href="#R15">15</a>, <a href="#R16">16</a>, <a href="#R17">17</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e175">To address these questions, our empirical analysis is focused on the Maoist movement
                                 in Nepal during the People’s War (1996-2006) and the period of post-war transition.
                                 The People’s War was initiated by the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) (CPN(M)) who
                                 led the armed uprising against what they defined as the ‘exclusionary’ state [<a href="#R18">18</a>, <a href="#R19">19</a>, <a href="#R20">20</a>]. The party and its military wing, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), secured widespread
                                 support from large sectors of the population, especially from the economically marginalized,
                                 ethnic minorities, and those from deprived areas away from the capital. The movement
                                 also garnered strong support from women, and many joined the ranks of the PLA. Part
                                 of the CPN(M)’s success was its progressive appeal, which promised a radical change,
                                 including eradication of all forms of discriminations based on gender, caste, class,
                                 ethnicity and religion [<a href="#R10">10</a>, <a href="#R21">21</a>, <a href="#R22">22</a>, <a href="#R23">23</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e199">In framing the Maoist movement as a populist movement, we draw on Laclau’s conceptualization
                                 of populism as a discursive construct that has a particular form: it is organized
                                 around a dichotomy between ‘us the people’ and ‘the other’ [<a href="#R24">24</a>]. We then show how the Maoist agenda of class-struggle, constructed around the dichotomy
                                 between the ‘oppressed’ and the ‘elite’, relied on a specific gender agenda. Whilst
                                 the gender agenda was constructed in ways that produced sameness—homogenizing women
                                 as a category within the broader oppressed ‘people’- we argue that during the time
                                 of war this gender agenda was largely successful. That is, it contributed to the legitimization
                                 of the movement’s ‘progressive’ appeal and reinforced a sense of collective identity
                                 that crossed gendered and hierarchical lines amongst cadre and supporters [<a href="#R10">10</a>, <a href="#R12">12</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e210">However, in the post-conflict context, when the Maoist party grappled with maintaining
                                 political power as it entered mainstream politics, the sense of collective identity
                                 amongst supporters began to fragment, and although the party still maintained significant
                                 political support, it was unable to retain its populist appeal. We argue that one
                                 of the key factors in this fragmentation, is the way in which the Maoist agenda shifted
                                 to no longer being relatable to many of the women that supported the movement during
                                 the war. This led to some women withdrawing from the movement or finding new ways
                                 to seize the legacy of the Maoist rhetoric of gender equality [<a href="#R25">25</a>]. We argue that taken together, these ways in which women have enacted upon the legacy
                                 of the Maoist movement has contributed to the deconstruction of the wartime collective
                                 identity and its ‘progressive’ identity, and ultimately the demise of the movement
                                 as populist.

                              <p id="d1e215">After providing insight into the methodology, the article proceeds by first constructing
                                 an analytical framework situated in the literature on populism and collective identity,
                                 before integrating feminist literature on populism, conflict and post-conflict transitions.
                                 Following our theoretical discussion, we embark on an empirical analysis of how the
                                 Maoist gender agenda was constructed and relied upon to claim a ‘progressive’ identity,
                                 during the period of conflict in Nepal. Taking a bi-directional approach, we reveal
                                 how this agenda was not purely constructed by the leadership, but how grassroots women
                                 also played a crucial role in shaping the agenda; an agenda that relied on both the
                                 homogenization of women as a group, and ‘sameness’ in terms of women taking on ‘masculine
                                 roles’ as a measure of emancipation. In the second empirical section, we shift to
                                 a discussion of the post conflict context. We explore the role that women play in
                                 the fragmentation of the wartime collective identity, by examining how ex-PLA women
                                 in the lower echelons of the movement started to withdraw their support and contest
                                 the wartime homogenizing discourses. We show how this contributes to the decline of
                                 the movement’s populist appeal, thus exposing the crucial role of gender in the construction
                                 and fragmentation of left-wing populist movements.

                                 and post-conflict this article takes a collaborative approach, synthesizing empirical
                                 research from the three author’s complimentary research projects carried out between
                                 2011-2018. This allows us to draw from a combined bank of over 100 in-depth interviews
                                 with women and men ex-combatants, civil society members and Maoist female politicians.
                                 Besides allowing us to cover specific timeframes, our collaborative approach produces
                                 nuanced insights into how the wartime populist discourses are experienced by the lower
                                 echelons [<a href="#R26">26</a>] of the movement. To examine the discourses of the Maoist leadership we also draw
                                 on secondary sources. Our two main sources include <i>The Worker</i>, an English-language publication disseminated by the CPN(M) and a Maoist Nepali-language
                                 publication <i>Janadesh</i>, more widely read across Nepal [<a href="#R27">27</a>]. These sources, combined with interviews with female Maoist politicians, allow us
                                 to examine the forms of femininities and masculinities that were constructed and employed
                                 to mobilize Nepal’s rural population, and to highlight how the official discourses
                                 construct the dichotomy between ‘people’ and the ‘elite’ over time.

                              <p id="d1e237">Although conceptualizations of populism remain contested, more broadly there is general
                                 agreement that it refers to a political endeavour that is built around the dichotomy
                                 of ‘us—the people’ versus ‘them—the elite’ (E.g. [<a href="#R28">28</a>, <a href="#R29">29</a>]). A prominent approach in the literature conceptualizes populism through an ideational
                                 perspective. This approach understands populism as a ‘thin-centred ideology’ that
                                 can be attached to other ‘more complete’ ideologies that range across the political
                                 spectrum [<a href="#R28">28</a>, <a href="#R30">30</a>]. Another prominent approach frames populism as a specific form of political strategy,
                                 paying close attention to how strategies differ and evolve over time [<a href="#R31">31</a>]. However, the most relevant conceptualization for our analysis is the understanding
                                 of populism as a discursive style, drawn from Laclau’s work [<a href="#R24">24</a>]. This approach understands populism as a discursive construct that has a particular
                                 form: it is organized around a dichotomy between ‘us the people’ and ‘the other’ [<a href="#R24">24</a>]. Rather than being a substantive ideology populism is understood to contain an empty
                                 core. What therefore characterizes populist rhetoric is a chain of relational ‘empty
                                 signifiers’ through which the collective ‘us’ is delineated and gains its meaning
                                 [<a href="#R24">24</a>, <a href="#R29">29</a>, <a href="#R32">32</a>]. In the context of Nepal, the Maoist leadership used ‘empty signifiers’ such as
                                 defining themselves as ‘progressive’ or ‘humane’, representing a shift from the ‘backward’
                                 or ‘semi-feudal elite oppressors’ [<a href="#R33">33</a>]. This gave meaning to the Maoist populist agenda that constructed a vision of a
                                 ‘<i>Naya</i> (New) Nepal’, promising equality and dignity to its supporters.

                              <p id="d1e277">Within the burgeoning literature on populism, the main focus of analyses tends to
                                 be political parties or their leaders; much attention has been paid to Hugo Chavez
                                 and the United Socialist Party of Venezuela, or La Pen and her French National Front.
                                 However, top-down approaches may overlook the important role that grassroots organizations
                                 play in institutionalizing populist movements and constructing populist agendas [<a href="#R34">34</a>, <a href="#R35">35</a>]. Given that party-led populism may emerge as a ‘corollary of its bottom-up incarnation’,
                                 Aslandis argues that a more complete understanding of populist movements can be developed
                                 through also engaging with the interactions between a populist leadership and their
                                 grassroots support base [<a href="#R35">35</a>]. For example, previously ‘expressed grievances, or ‘demands’ at the grassroots level
                                 may be adopted and articulated through a populist leadership that ‘infuses them with
                                 political importance, cultivating an appetite for action’ [<a href="#R35">35</a>].
                                 
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e291">Panizza argues that populism can be understood as a mode of political identification;
                                 that populist movements give meaning to ‘the people’ as a political actor, which is
                                 set in opposition to the antagonistic identity of the ‘elite’ or ‘other’ [<a href="#R34">34</a>]. Despite the diversity of identities encompassed within understandings of ‘the people’,
                                 the populist project aims at constructing a ‘single, homogenous identity’ [<a href="#R36">36</a>] that tends to revolve around the nodal point of the anti-elite. Laclau has termed
                                 this as the ‘politics of equivalence’ [<a href="#R24">24</a>]. It draws ‘dispersed elements (agents, ideas, practices, demands) into a discourse
                                 by reinforcing what they have in common (their ‘‘equivalence’’ or sameness),’ [<a href="#R34">34</a>] and thus simplifies the political space between the two antagonistic camps [<a href="#R24">24</a>]. Taking account of constructions of ‘sameness’ within populist discourse highlights
                                 how the reformulation of these constructions may contribute to breaking down traditional
                                 societal divisions between disparate identity groups, in order to place them within
                                 the sphere of ‘the people’. In doing so, this has the potential to elevate the demands
                                 or grievances of varying identity groups within the broader antagonisms pitted as
                                 the ‘anti–people’ or elite. As part of this agenda, gendered grievances may be included.
                                 However, what is problematic is that women’s grievances are often defined in terms
                                 of sameness, leading to a conceptualization of ‘women’ as a homogeneous group [<a href="#R6">6</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e312">In Nepal, the core of Maoist populist appeal was their claim to be supporting ‘the
                                 people’ who were ‘oppressed’ by the elite as a result of varying identity markers
                                 such as caste, ethnicity, gender, as well as the exclusion of these groups from the
                                 urban centre or positions of influence. Within their populist ambitions, the Maoist
                                 leadership was successful in bringing the grievances of multiple ‘oppressed’ identity
                                 groups under one ‘class’ banner, through which to justify violent action against the
                                 so-called ‘elite’. Those defined as ‘oppressed groups’ were those from marginalized
                                 castes or indigenous populations [<a href="#R37">37</a>, <a href="#R38">38</a>], rural populations not aligned to the elite, as well as women. Operationalized together
                                 ‘the oppressed’ became the ‘us’, ‘the people’ that need to be emancipated, versus
                                 the ‘oppressive state’.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e320">The salience of the ‘us’ and ‘them’ rhetoric was also key to the development of a
                                 salient sense of collective identity amongst supporters and particularly amongst members
                                 of the People’s Liberation Army. In social movement literature, collective identity
                                 is understood as the critical link between ‘social identity (at the individual and
                                 group level) and collective action’ [<a href="#R39">39</a>]. Collective identity stems from the development of a common identity associated
                                 with a particular social group, in such a way that identity of ‘I myself’ is merged
                                 into the group ‘we’ [<a href="#R40">40</a>]. In social movements, the group identity is constructed on collective action, which
                                 also incorporates group goals, ideology, norms and values. Group members engage with
                                 this identity and seek to uphold it via an ‘active process of shaping and forging
                                 an image of what the group stands for’, what it wishes to achieve, and ‘how it wishes
                                 to be viewed by others’ [<a href="#R39">39</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e331">Constructing collective identity is a crucial function of ‘social movement entrepreneurship
                                 and populism constitutes an exemplary case of identity mobilization under the inclusive
                                 banner of ‘the people’ [<a href="#R35">35</a>]. Key to this is the ability of leaders to identify with ‘the people’ and their realities—or
                                 ‘flaunt the low’ as termed by Ostiguy [<a href="#R41">41</a>]. In the CPN(M), the leadership was particularly effective in its ability to appear
                                 attuned to the grievances of specific groups, which was key to gaining trust amongst
                                 a variety of groups and constructing a collective identity that was inclusive of both
                                 ‘the people’ and the leadership. In interviews carried out by author 1 with both male
                                 and female ex-PLA, interviewees frequently expressed how, during the war, they felt
                                 like the leadership had the people’s interests as a priority and ‘could be trusted’,

                                 amongst recruits, and also facilitated the bi-directional relationship between the
                                 lower and upper echelons in the construction of the progressive identity.

                              <p id="d1e362">Yet in post-conflict, the question remains as to what happens to the collective identity
                                 of ‘the people’ in the transition of a populist movement into a position of government.
                                 Panizza has argued that ‘the people’ takes on a different meaning when a populist
                                 leader, initially situated outside the government, enters mainstream politics, previously
                                 constructed as the realm of ‘the elite’ [<a href="#R34">34</a>]. The leadership is no longer seen as ‘flaunting the low’, in Ostiguy’s terms, and
                                 thus becomes disconnected from the identity of ‘the people’; instead merges with what
                                 was once portrayed as ‘the elite other’ [<a href="#R41">41</a>]. This has implications for the multiple identities that were previously included
                                 in ‘the people’ and may lead to the re-orientation of inclusions and exclusions. It
                                 also has implications for the sense of collective identity experienced by participants
                                 to the movement during the conflict. This is particularly important in the case of
                                 Nepal where the shift from conflict to the post-conflict context led to a change in
                                 the positioning of Maoists from a revolutionary warring party, fighting on behalf
                                 of the people, to a mainstream political party, with an ambition to stay in power.
                                 As such, we pay close attention to how ‘the people’ are portrayed within the post-conflict
                                 political goals of the leadership and juxtapose this with the way the ‘collective’
                                 is experienced and contested by women ex-PLA as new hierarchies and needs emerge.
                                 This allows us to expose the role that the gender positive agenda plays in the fragmentation
                                 and redefining of the movement away from its populist origin in post-conflict.

                              <p id="d1e373">The analysis of the relationship between gender and populism in political science
                                 literature tends to approach gender as a demographic factor or as a variable that
                                 can be measured. For example, gender has been invoked to study the ‘gender gap’ in
                                 electoral support for Right Wing Political Parties (E.g. [<a href="#R44">44</a>, <a href="#R45">45</a>]) or as a variable in accounts that seek to establish regional comparisons and/or
                                 comparisons between left and right populism [<a href="#R46">46</a>]. Whilst such deployment of gender has its merits, what goes missing is the gendered
                                 nature of populism <i>per se</i> (when stripped of its ‘host’ ideology and the national culture in which it operates)
                                 [<a href="#R4">4</a>]. In contrast, an emerging field of feminist scholarship reveals how constructions
                                 of masculinity and femininity and framings of gendered hierarchies are at the core
                                 of how populism as an ideological construct operates (E.g. [<a href="#R5">5</a>, <a href="#R47">47</a>, <a href="#R48">48</a>]). Maiguascha argues that ‘[i]n a totalising politics of ‘us’ vs ‘them’ there is
                                 no space or incentive to inquire into the internal conflicts or hierarchies that shape
                                 each camp or the way that gender might differentially impact on the lives of women
                                 and men in material ways as lived experience’ [<a href="#R4">4</a>]. Whilst the existing feminist contributions differ in their conceptualizations of
                                 populism, there is a broad agreement that the opposition between ‘us’ and ‘them’ requires
                                 feminist scrutiny of how gendered power relations are implicated—entrenched, mobilized
                                 or possibly navigated—in such a construction and in the politics it enables [<a href="#R2">2</a>, <a href="#R49">49</a>]. The strengthening of the populist right in Europe and in the US and the emergence
                                 of right populist parties touting explicitly anti-feminist agendas has generated urgent
                                 scholarly engagement [<a href="#R49">49</a>, <a href="#R50">50</a>, <a href="#R51">51</a>]. Crucially, there is also an emerging strand of feminist analysis that addresses
                                 right populism in the context of South Asia [<a href="#R7">7</a>, <a href="#R8">8</a>, <a href="#R52">52</a>]. In contrast, the role of gender in left populism, and the relation between left
                                 populism and feminism specifically, is scarcely researched. The few existing studies
                                 reveal a complex picture. In a comparative study of left populism in Spain (Podemos)
                                 and right populism in Finland (The Finns), Kantola and Lombardo argue that political
                                 ideology matters. They suggest that ‘left-wing parties, though populist, are still
                                 better allies of feminist politics than right-wing parties both in terms of empowerment
                                 and transformation’ [<a href="#R6">6</a>]. Yet, their multi-dimensional analysis also shows that the ‘ethos of hegemonic masculinity’
                                 endures in left populism, apparent in ‘informal gendered institutions’ (such as gender
                                 norms) and in the bellicose and confrontational style of politics that both of the
                                 populist parties under scrutiny articulate. Moving beyond the context of political
                                 parties, Emejulu reveals a problematic relation between left populism and feminism
                                 also in grass root organizing [<a href="#R3">3</a>]. Examining left and right populism in the US, she shows how in the progressive populist
                                 discourse feminist claims are reconstructed from ‘social justice’ to ‘special interest’
                                 claims, a move which labels feminism as an ‘unrepresentative expression of elite partisan
                                 interests’ [<a href="#R3">3</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e438">What appears clear from the feminist analysis is that left populism, when appealing
                                 to a generalized ‘people’, is not exempt from the charge of erasing differences and
                                 inequalities, with potentially divisive issues such as gender and race being silenced
                                 for the sake of unity or numerical majority [<a href="#R6">6</a>]. To examine how this gendered character of left populism, specifically it’s tendency
                                 to homogenize, evolves through war to post-war transitions, we build on feminist scholarship
                                 on peace and conflict.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e443">Feminist peace and conflict scholarship offers crucial insights into conceptualizing
                                 both the contested question of women’s agency within violent populist movements and
                                 the temporality of the post-war context. At the core of feminist scholarship on war
                                 is the acknowledgement that gendered discourses are invoked to legitimize war—to make
                                 war intelligible [<a href="#R53">53</a>]. For example, in Nepal mobilization for violence was underpinned by the production
                                 of specific femininities and masculinities—for instance representations of women as
                                 an oppressed group ready to stand up and fight against their oppressor, or defining
                                 men as ‘brave warriors’ dedicated to fight for a new and more progressive nation [<a href="#R54">54</a>, <a href="#R55">55</a>]. Building on this, rich feminist scholarship explores how women who participate
                                 in non-state armed groups engage with such gendered discourses, whether in context
                                 of ethno-nationalism or class struggle (E.g. [<a href="#R56">56</a>, <a href="#R57">57</a>, <a href="#R58">58</a>]). The question of instrumentalization emerges as central, as the feminist analyses
                                 have exposed the ways in which agendas of gender equality and indeed women’s participation
                                 are often strategically promoted by the leadership of such movements to broaden their
                                 recruitment pool and to garner popular appeal [<a href="#R59">59</a>, <a href="#R60">60</a>]. We build specifically on feminist work that has examined how women interpret these
                                 militant agendas and conceive of their own contribution, including how the agenda
                                 of ‘sameness’ constructed during conflict period may provide a platform for women
                                 to contest the populist agenda in the post-conflict context [<a href="#R14">14</a>, <a href="#R61">61</a>, <a href="#R62">62</a>, <a href="#R63">63</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e483">A prominent strand of feminist literature conceptualizes the ‘postwar moment’ [<a href="#R64">64</a>] as one of fragile opportunity. In this interpretation the myriad roles in which
                                 women engage in war, including as fighters and political organizers, may instantiate
                                 reconfigurations of gender norms, and therefore create possibilities for transforming
                                 gendered relations of power, leading to various ‘ambivalent gains’ [<a href="#R65">65</a>]. A crucial theme in the literature is the prevalent threat of a post-conflict ‘backlash’,
                                 a dynamic that involves a violent reinstating of regulatory gender norms (E.g. [<a href="#R66">66</a>, <a href="#R67">67</a>]). What remains less explored, are the complex legacies that women’s participation
                                 in a militant movement generates, and how these legacies may be enacted upon when
                                 the armed struggle is over [<a href="#R57">57</a>, <a href="#R68">68</a>]. We explore how women who are in various ways positioned within the Maoist movement
                                 navigate and contest exclusions and hierarchies that start to emerge in the post-war
                                 context. Such negotiations result in both, a withdrawing a way from the movement,
                                 as well as finding new ways to seize the legacy of the Maoist populist rhetoric of
                                 gender equality in the realm of parliamentary politics. We argue that taken together,
                                 these ways in which women have enacted upon the legacy of the Maoist movement in the
                                 post-war context significantly contribute to the deconstruction of the movement’s
                                 populist appeal.

                              <p id="d1e507">This section examines gender as central to the ways in which ‘the people’ was constructed
                                 and delineated in the Maoist populist rhetoric during war. We argue that the way gender
                                 equality was framed as a key demand of the ‘people’ within the rhetoric of the high-level
                                 leadership, and the way women were portrayed as a specific oppressed group amongst
                                 others, was significant in defining the movement as progressive and representing the
                                 aspirations of a <i>Naya</i> Nepal. What is crucially highlighted in this section is that the portrayal of women
                                 in the populist agenda was built around ‘sameness’; both amongst women, and in terms
                                 of the way women were celebrated as taking on masculine roles ‘within PLA’. However,
                                 while problematic in terms of recognizing intersectionality and the diverse needs
                                 of women [<a href="#R14">14</a>] in the extraordinary circumstances of conflict, this position of sameness actually
                                 facilitated the construction of a collective identity that transcended gendered boundaries
                                 and contributed to the success of the movements’ populist appeal during the war. Importantly,
                                 however, we highlight that the way women’s emancipation was incorporated into the
                                 Maoist agenda was not purely driven by leadership ambition or instrumentalization
                                 but was the product of a bi-directional relationship between the leadership and grassroots
                                 women.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e515">The Maoist position on women’s emancipation was framed within the overarching focus
                                 on ‘class-struggle’, which facilitated the use of ‘the oppressed’ as the nodal point
                                 on which ‘the people’ were conceptualized [<a href="#R38">38</a>, <a href="#R69">69</a>]. The rhetoric from the leadership constructed a narrative of ‘women as an oppressed
                                 group’ in which women’s emancipation became part of the defining identity of the movement
                                 as ‘progressive’. This was contrasted with backward and ‘semi-feudal’ framing of the
                                 state who were portrayed as responsible for women’s oppression. In an article written
                                 in 2003 by the head of the women’s department, Comrade Parvati, she defines women
                                 as ‘doubly oppressed’ [<a href="#R70">70</a>], by both the semi-feudal political system and patriarchy, the latter of which was
                                 understood as a product of the former (Also see [<a href="#R54">54</a>]). Maoist rhetoric would make reference to how women’s oppression is rooted in patrilineal
                                 ‘relations of land-ownership’, and social norms around marriage and the family that
                                 renders women subject to widespread economic, social and political marginalization
                                 [<a href="#R71">71</a>]. In an earlier article from 1999 Comrade Parvati explains how certain women have
                                 contributed to multiple nationalist struggles in the history of the Nepali state,
                                 but notes that ‘[I]t was only after CPN (Maoist) started the People’s War that women
                                 from grassroots, mainly rural women, started getting mobilized [<a href="#R71">71</a>]’. In this statement it portrays the CPN(M) as the ‘progressive’ platform for women’s
                                 emancipation via the vision of a <i>Naya</i> Nepal in which all women would be freed from their oppressed status. In <i>Reports from the Battlefield</i> from the 1998 Worker magazine, it stated that, ‘The heroic exploits of hundreds of
                                 women who have joined the guerrilla squads and defence groups have been a source of
                                 inspiration and favourable anecdotes throughout the country [<a href="#R72">72</a>]’. In emphasizing how the party was attuned to the needs of women, they claimed that
                                 ‘The fact that women are the most inspired group emerging in the last 2 years of People’s
                                 War itself indicates a definite victory for the Nepalese revolution’ (cited in [<a href="#R73">73</a>]). This position did not address the differences in women’s needs or status as it
                                 intersects with caste of ethnicity, which has rightfully been a key critique of the
                                 ostensibly gender positive agenda of the CPN(M) [<a href="#R10">10</a>, <a href="#R14">14</a>, <a href="#R38">38</a>, <a href="#R74">74</a>]. Nevertheless, the ‘sameness’ position as invoked in the ‘women as an oppressed
                                 group’ narrative, was crucial in defining the movement’s ‘progressive’ populist appeal.
                                 It served to invoke a discourse through which the party was portrayed as speaking
                                 on behalf of the ‘downtrodden’ and was a key link in ‘the chain of equivalence’ that
                                 pitted the ‘people’ as represented by the CPN(M) versus the so-called ‘exclusionary
                                 state.’

                              <p id="d1e561">Yet although it was the leadership through which the gender agenda and its homogenizing
                                 position was articulated, it is important to also recognize the role of grassroots
                                 women in constructing and reifying the agenda. The All Nepal Women’s Association (Revolutionary)
                                 (ANWA(R)), who were aligned to the party and whose membership included grassroots
                                 women, were key in ensuring that the multiple harms and discriminations against women
                                 were recognized, exposed, and challenged by the party. In the early years (ANWA(R))
                                 were involved in campaigning in the villages against alcohol abuse, which they identified
                                 as one of the key drivers of domestic violence in the rural areas [<a href="#R69">69</a>, <a href="#R75">75</a>, <a href="#R76">76</a>]. As a result, an alcohol ban was implemented in the Maoists heartlands, and later
                                 became policy in other areas under Maoist control, as well as being imposed as policy
                                 amongst Maoist personnel [<a href="#R54">54</a>, <a href="#R77">77</a>]. ANWA(R) were also involved in pushing for policies banning polygamy, child marriage
                                 and dowry. They rejected the norms of son preference and encouraged village women
                                 not to participate in festivals such as <i>Teej</i>, where women are expected to fast in honour of their husbands. In the Maoist publication
                                 <i>Janadesh</i>, an article from 1997 written by member of ANWA(R) exemplifies their advocacy on
                                 this issue,

                                 <i>The concept of the Teej festival is that women are to be kept as a slave for men and

                                    play with her physically or emotionally. This festival is about keeping women as objects.
                                    Because of our efforts, Teej now becomes the day of exposing how married women are

                              <p id="d1e593">Beyond ANWA(R), other grassroots women and student groups were also involved in defining
                                 Maoist approaches to challenging gender discriminations. In an interview with a former
                                 leader of one of the Women’s Fronts, author 1 was told how grassroots women contributed
                                 to the reformulation of Maoist policy to combat the harmful practice of <i>Chhaupadi</i> in the Far West region [<a href="#R79">79</a>]. This practice banishes women and girls from the home during menstruation and they
                                 are forced to sleep in a small hut, leaving them exposed to multiple harms [<a href="#R80">80</a>]. She described how the Maoists first used to destroy the huts, but were informed
                                 by local women that this had a detrimental impact as girls were then made to sleep
                                 outside. Instead, the Women’s Front, together with local women, participated in a
                                 15-day protest against the practice, marching through numerous villages, under the
                                 slogan of ‘we have to open your minds and break down the hut’.

                              <p id="d1e604">Women also contributed to shaping the agenda purely by joining the movement and legitimizing
                                 the way the ideology was perceived as addressing their needs. As explained by one
                                 former PLA women, ‘I joined the Maoist movement when I was a student. I had seen women’s
                                 sufferings due to violence, poverty, dowry, polygamy and so on. I wanted to do something
                                 about it so I joined the Maoist party’ [<a href="#R81">81</a>]. This was a position found in multiple interviews with ex-PLA women carried out
                                 by all three authors, where women expressed that gender-based violence and gender
                                 discriminatory norms had been important reasons for them to join the Maoist moment.
                                 Thus, although the leadership may have been the mouthpiece for articulating the oppression
                                 of women, women at the grassroots level also contributed to shaping both the rhetorical
                                 agenda and, in some cases, the manner in which actions for women’s emancipation were
                                 implemented.

                              <p id="d1e609">Recruitment campaigns became more targeted towards women after the second year of
                                 the war, and although there is no exact data available, it is estimated that by the
                                 end of the conflict between 33%- 40% of the ranks were populated by women. Key to
                                 understanding the success of the movement is recognizing the ability of the leadership
                                 to create a sense of collective identity within the ranks that crossed both gender,
                                 caste, ethnic or hierarchical boundaries. Recruits were instructed to refer to each
                                 other as ‘comrade’ or address each using respectful language regardless of gender,
                                 caste or status in the institution [<a href="#R82">82</a>]. In memories of quotidian life described in interviews with author 1, former combatants
                                 reminisced how cooking and cleaning were done on ‘rotation’. As noted by one ex-PLA
                                 woman, ‘work division was equal among both men and women. There was no discrimination’
                                 [<a href="#R83">83</a>]. In narratives of training and ‘battle’ both men and women ex-PLA spoke of how this
                                 was done ‘with both men and women together’ [<a href="#R84">84</a>]. For men this meant they experienced women carrying out activities what would normally
                                 only be associated with men and masculinity, which, at times was met with surprise
                                 at the physical capabilities of women [<a href="#R82">82</a>]. For male members of the PLA, it has been written that participation in the PLA
                                 produced a sense of being the ‘progressive’ man [<a href="#R10">10</a>], and is exemplified in how PLA compared themselves with the state forces. In interviews
                                 with ex-PLA men, it was found that, the collective identity of ‘us’—the forward-thinking
                                 protectors of ‘the people’—was frequently compared dichotomously with the ‘feudal’
                                 and ‘backward’ state forces, made up of the police and army. The state forces’ treatment
                                 of women was often cited as evidence of their backwardness and contrasted with PLA
                                 men’s own stories of respect for their female comrades and narratives of punishing
                                 villagers for the maltreatment of women [<a href="#R82">82</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e630">Thus the role that gender played in defining the sense of ‘us’ (the collective) as
                                 ‘progressive’ was experienced by both men and women recruits. In turn, the group identity
                                 associated with what was perceived as a reformist agenda in which recruits felt they
                                 had agency within, was instrumental in the maintaining cohesion and restricting defection
                                 in the PLA.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e632">There have been multiple critiques of the way in which women were defined by the Maoists
                                 in terms of a homogenous group [<a href="#R38">38</a>, <a href="#R74">74</a>], however, ‘sameness’ in the PLA also meant justifying women’s emancipation through
                                 demonstrating sameness (as men) in capabilities. Maoist propaganda tended to begin
                                 with addressing cadre as ‘the brave men and women of the People’s Liberation Army’
                                 [<a href="#R85">85</a>] emphasizing how a women’s capabilities were of no less than men and celebrating
                                 those who became ‘martyrs’ for the movement. Although this is problematic in terms
                                 of women’s realities, the ‘sameness’ position played a crucial role during the war
                                 in creating a sense of collective identity that was constructed around empowerment
                                 of the ‘oppressed’ and that fed into the populist ambition. This was a collective
                                 identity that may have been facilitated by the leadership, but women of the PLA also
                                 played a key role in its survival through their participation and through their visibility,
                                 willingly, taking on such roles. Here again it shows the contribution of women in
                                 the construction of a gender positive agenda espoused by the leadership, and which
                                 was instrumental in defining the Maoist identity as ‘progressive’ in how it represented
                                 ‘the people’.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e643">In examining the Maoist movement in Nepal in populist terms, this case is by no means
                                 exempt from feminist critiques of left-wing populism that expose the ‘ethos of hegemonic
                                 masculinity’ within them [<a href="#R6">6</a>]. Despite claiming a progressive agenda the Maoist leadership was predominantly populated
                                 by men who led in a style associated with stereotypical masculine norms, celebrating
                                 traits such as warriorhood, power and bravery [<a href="#R10">10</a>]. Moreover, it is well documented that some women both inside and outside of the
                                 movement were faced with harms or discriminations at the hands of the Maoists [<a href="#R86">86</a>]. However, this does not overshadow the platform it provided for women to contribute
                                 to the progressive agenda and the movement towards change, despite this agenda being
                                 constructed around ‘sameness’. The narrative of women as a ‘single oppressed group’
                                 that is guilty of erasing differences and inequalities between women, and places maleness
                                 as a measure of emancipation, may have worked during the period of conflict when there
                                 was a clear goal of overthrowing the state in order to institute a more progressive
                                 agenda. However, this narrative that is constructed around ‘sameness’ becomes no longer
                                 tenable in the post-conflict context. It is this shift that we now turn to.

                              <p id="d1e657">In this section we examine how the movement’s gender agenda is constructed differently
                                 in the post-conflict context as the CPN-M enters parliamentary politics and the movement’s
                                 emphasis shifts from military to political goals. Our focus is explicitly on the bi-directional
                                 relationship between the leadership and the grassroots supporters through which the
                                 agenda is constructed, and how this relationship transforms in the post-conflict context.
                                 Through focusing on the contribution of the women ex-PLA combatants, engaged in the
                                 lower echelons of the movement, we show how the wartime collective identity starts
                                 to fragment as new hierarchies emerge along the lines of rank, including between women
                                 ex-PLA combatants. We argue that the way in which the women lower level cadres start
                                 to contest the wartime homogenizing discourses and to withdraw their support from
                                 the movement in crucial ways, contributes to the movement’s loss of its populist appeal.

                              <p id="d1e659">After the signing of the peace agreement in 2006 the Maoists joined mainstream politics
                                 and went on to win a landslide victory in the 2008 Constituent Assembly election.
                                 This resulted in Prachanda, the chairman of the CPN(M), shifting position from clandestine
                                 populist revolutionary to Prime Minister of the world’s youngest Republic. The rallying
                                 call of ‘us’ the new ‘progressive’ elite of the ‘people’, against ‘them’, the old
                                 elite, was instrumental in the election success. Election success can also be attributed
                                 to a wartime rhetoric of inclusion, taking account of a legacy of political exclusion
                                 along gender and caste/ethnic lines. The significant shift towards greater inclusion
                                 of women and marginalized caste/ethnic groups in formal politics in crucial ways resonated
                                 with the Maoist leadership’s wartime populist rhetoric of fighting ‘for the people’,
                                 including with the agenda of women’s liberation. As such, in entering the mainstream
                                 political process the party leadership was able to retain -at least on the surface-
                                 its populist discourse of inclusion, and the ways in which ‘the people’ was constructed
                                 in the populist rhetoric (See [<a href="#R87">87</a>]).

                              <p id="d1e664">The gains made regarding women’s entry into formal politics and broader women’s rights
                                 contrast with the prominent emphasis on backlash in feminist analysis of post-conflict
                                 contexts, in particular when women have contributed to militant movements [<a href="#R66">66</a>]. However, although the Maoist agenda brought more women into the political fora,
                                 inconsistencies in the agenda also began to emerge. For example, the CPN(M) included
                                 no women in the peace negotiations and in the development of a six-member committee
                                 founded to draft the Interim Constitution, there was initially no women nominated
                                 for inclusion. The women in the party, in particular ex-PLA high-level commanders
                                 who had entered parliamentary politics after the peace agreement, sought to hold the
                                 party leadership accountable regarding their wartime promises. This pressure was combined
                                 with protests by women’s rights organizations and broader coalitions of women politicians,
                                 that led to the inclusion of a 33% quote in the Constituent Assembly.

                                 level cadres as an example. This disconnect led to the fragmentation of the collective
                                 identity that had upheld the party’s populist appeal and contributed to many women
                                 in the lower echelons stepping away from the movement and disengaging from party activities.
                                 This tendency to ‘withdraw’ [<a href="#R25">25</a>] from the movement emerged strongly in interviews that author 2 conducted in 2013,
                                 with women who had fought in the PLA as low-level commanders and foot soldiers. All
                                 the interview narratives were peppered with passionate critiques of the leadership
                                 of the party, with an emphasis on the non-recognition of the contribution of the lower
                                 level cadres (See [<a href="#R88">88</a>]).

                              <p id="d1e680">What was particularly striking, was how these critiques were directed also at the
                                 ‘women leaders’, women who had fought in the PLA as high-level commanders and had
                                 since the peace agreement entered parliamentary politics, becoming members of the
                                 CA. Ambika who had been a low level commander during the war expressed her thoughts
                                 about the ‘women leaders’ in this way,

                              <p id="d1e690">What we argue is that these reflections demonstrate how the collective ‘we’ has started
                                 to fragment in the post-conflict context. First, new identifications start to emerge
                                 along the lines of rank, distinctions being made between the ‘lower level’ and ‘commanders’
                                 or the ‘lower level’ and the ‘leaders’. Second, whilst the wartime collective identity
                                 was organized around the notion of equality, in the post-conflict context the leadership’s
                                 commitment to this core principle becomes increasingly questioned. To us, Ambika’s
                                 reflections resonate with Panizza’s argument that ‘the people’ takes on a different
                                 meaning when a populist leader, initially situated outside the government, enters
                                 mainstream politics, previously constructed as the realm of ‘the elite’ [<a href="#R34">34</a>]. The leadership is no longer seen as ‘flaunting the low’ and thus becomes disconnected
                                 from their own constructed identity of ‘the people’ and instead merges with what was
                                 once portrayed as ‘the elite other’ [<a href="#R41">41</a>]. In intriguing ways Ambika’s reflections also highlight how the war time discourse
                                 that positioned ‘women’ as a homogenous group, based on their shared oppression, becomes
                                 contested when new hierarchies between women ex-PLA combatants start to emerge.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e698">The shifts in the relationship between the leadership and the lower echelons of the
                                 movement we seek to capture, are certainly entangled with broader changes in gendered
                                 power relations and norms that the post-conflict context generates [<a href="#R68">68</a>]. For example, in the context of Nepal, norms around motherhood became central to
                                 how the position of women ex-combatants was constructed in both discourses of the
                                 Maoist leadership and in the international discourses around peacebuilding [<a href="#R90">90</a>, <a href="#R91">91</a>]. As many of the PLA fighters who had married during the war or soon after the peace
                                 agreement, had children in the immediate aftermath of the war, the norms around childcare
                                 were debated and contested at different levels of the movement [<a href="#R92">92</a>]. It would be tempting then to connect women’s tendency to withdraw from the movement
                                 and party activities primarily with the restrengthening of gender norms in the post-conflict
                                 context, and specifically, how women ex-PLAs were positioned as primarily responsible
                                 for childcare. However, we argue that there is value in taking a step back and examining
                                 how the women ex-combatants understood their relation to the party in the post-conflict
                                 context, and how they conceived of their own contribution and the withdrawal of it.
                                 To do so it is illustrative to examine some of the concrete practices through which
                                 the women ex-PLA combatants were withdrawing their support.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e712">The fragmentation we examine had begun to translate into concrete practices through
                                 which lower level cadres were withdrawing their support to the party, including for
                                 election activities. A crucial election was held in 2013 for a second CA, after the
                                 first CA was dissolved in 2012, having failed to deliver a new constitution despite
                                 four extensions. The Maoists had held the majority of seats in the first CA and also
                                 held the premiership position for half of the term [<a href="#R93">93</a>], however, the election of the 2nd CA saw a major drop in seats to third place [<a href="#R93">93</a>]. An important factor [<a href="#R94">94</a>] impacting the election result was a greater number of voter abstentions from within
                                 the former Maoist cadre and reduced efforts within this cohort to mobilize grassroots
                                 voters to rally around the former populist leadership. The crucial role of women cadres
                                 in the reduction of Maoist votes emerged in author 2’s interviews.

                              <p id="d1e723">Renuka, who described herself as a ‘seasoned cadre’ explained that she had not voted
                                 and had refused to contribute to election activities in her home village, where she
                                 could have mobilized ‘100-150 people’ to vote. In reflecting upon her decision, she
                                 noted how the party no longer respected the contribution of the seasoned cadre—pointing
                                 out the party’s failure to offer economic support for her to travel to conduct election
                                 activities: ‘we cannot sit like beggars’. Yet, what was striking about Renuka’s narrative
                                 was how this refusal to contribute was combined with a continuing commitment to the
                                 ‘fight for the country’ and ‘fight for the people’,

                              <p id="d1e734">Extending from Panizza, we argue that the kind of commitments and energies that the
                                 Maoist movement mobilized are not simply shaken off when the collective identity fragments
                                 and the movement starts to lose its populist appeal. Instead, they may take on new
                                 forms that do not necessarily resonate with the shifts in the discourses of the leadership.
                                 As Parashar amongst others highlight, what needs to be centred is how women active
                                 in militant movements interpret and contest agendas, including discourses of gender
                                 equality, and how these interpretations may shift in post-war contexts [<a href="#R57">57</a>]. In critiquing the leaders and in withdrawing their support, both Ambika and Renuka
                                 draw on their capacities as ex-fighters -and position themselves as those who had
                                 contributed to the struggle as part of the collective ‘we’. It is in her capacity
                                 as a seasoned cadre and as someone who has ‘brought changes’ that Renuka evaluates
                                 ‘who are the right leaders’ deserving of her support. Similarly, Ambika articulates
                                 her critique of the leadership in a language that directly draws on the specific discourses
                                 of women’s liberation propagated through the Maoist publications, simultaneously demonstrating
                                 fluency in this language and using it against the ‘women leaders’. With such a positioning
                                 she is able to question the sincerity of the leaders’ commitment to the struggle and
                                 to the women lower level cadres whom they had encouraged to fight.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e739">It is by centring the bi-directional relationship through which the populist discourse
                                 is constructed and deconstructed [<a href="#R35">35</a>], that we are able to highlight how the femininities produced in the war-time discourses
                                 are negotiated and contested by women in the lower echelons of the movement, and to
                                 point to the fractures in the collective identity as the leadership pursues parliamentary
                                 politics [<a href="#R34">34</a>]. In a context in which these fractures emerge along the lines of rank also between
                                 women ex-combatants, the homogenizing war time discourses that portray women as a
                                 group with shared interests and experiences of oppression becomes increasingly untenable.
                                 We argue that examining these contestations that target the leadership’s adherence
                                 to its own principle of equality—and the micro-level practices through which the lower
                                 level cadres withdraw support—is crucial in understanding how the movement starts

                              <p id="d1e750">In this article we have illustrated the key role that gender agendas play in defining
                                 left-wing populist movements in their progressive orientation, examining the case
                                 of the Maoist movement in Nepal. We have framed the Maoist movement as a populist
                                 movement that produced and relied on a dichotomous construct of the people as the
                                 ‘oppressed’ versus ‘the elite’, and that propagated armed violence as a means of transformation.
                                 Our aim was to capture the central role that gender ideology played in defining the
                                 trajectory of the movement—in how the movement’s populist agenda was constructed,
                                 retained and fragmented—and to examine this trajectory across conflict and into a
                                 post-conflict context. As our main theoretical move, we have centred the bi-directional
                                 relationship between the leadership of populist movements and their grassroots supporters,
                                 by operationalizing the concept of collective identity. This has allowed us to offer
                                 the following key insights.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e752">First, we show how the populist agenda of the Maoist movement produced a homogenizing
                                 discourse of ‘sameness’ in two specific ways, first, in terms of how ‘women’ were
                                 integrated into the broader category of the ‘oppressed’ as a homogenous group, and
                                 second, how women were celebrated as taking on masculine roles within the PLA—as having
                                 the same capacities as men. We argue that unpacking this gendered, homogenizing discourse
                                 is central to understanding the trajectory of the movement across conflict to post-conflict
                                 stages. We illustrate how during the extraordinary circumstances of armed struggle,
                                 such homogenizing discourse had certain uptake and resonance amongst the grassroot
                                 supporters, and how it enabled the construction of a cohesive collective identity,
                                 especially within the PLA. We argue then that the movement’s populist appeal and its
                                 ability to retain support during the conflict was intricately linked to its gender
                                 agenda, and specifically, enabled by the way this agenda overwrote multiple forms
                                 of difference—both between women as well as within the PLA.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e754">Second, we demonstrate the importance of examining the construction of gender agendas
                                 of populist movements over time, by revealing the way in which the collective, progressive
                                 identity of the Maoist movement fragments in the post-conflict context. Centring the
                                 experiences of the women ex-PLA cadres, we are able to illustrate how new identifications
                                 start to emerge along the lines of rank as well as the concrete practices through
                                 which the women start to withdraw their support for the movement. These new identifications
                                 directly contest the homogenizing discourses that position ‘women’ as an oppressed
                                 group, with new hierarchies being are articulated between the ‘women leaders’, entering
                                 the realm of formal politics, and the lower level cadres.

                              <p id="d1e756">Our argument contributes to the feminist and critical approaches to populism by offering
                                 a more nuanced understanding of how gender agendas of left-wing populist movements
                                 are constructed and deconstructed through the participation of grassroot supporters
                                 over time. First, feminist approaches to populism have argued that left-wing populism—both
                                 at the level of political parties and grassroot movements—tend to silence feminist
                                 agendas and women’s lived experience to construct and retain the unity of the ‘people’.
                                 Whilst such analysis has crucial merit, it tells us less about how and why women may
                                 actively participate in the construction of such homogenizing agendas <i>and</i> as circumstances shift, contribute to their deconstruction. Second, whilst strands
                                 of the broader populism literature argue for centring the interactions between leadership
                                 and grassroot supporters to examine evolvement of populist movements, these accounts
                                 rarely focus on constructions of femininities and masculinities as central to the
                                 movement’s trajectory. By centring the gender ideology of the Maoist movement in our
                                 analysis, we are able to show how the construction of homogenizing discourse of ‘sameness’,
                                 was central to the movements success during war as well as its failure to retain populist
                                 appeal in the post-conflict context.
