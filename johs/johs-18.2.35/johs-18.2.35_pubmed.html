                  <p class="first" id="d1e91">This article examines the construction of gender agendas in left-wing populist movements
                     that mobilise for armed struggle, by focusing on the case of the Maoist movement in
                     Nepal. Feminist scholarship has highlighted how left-wing populism, when appealing
                     to a generalized “people”, tend to produce homogenizing discourses that erase inequalities
                     and difference, even when such movements integrate a gender dimension. Examining the
                     trajectory of the Maoist movement over time, we argue that this ‘sameness’ may become
                     contested and utilized by women participating in the lower echelons of the movement,
                     as the political reality shifts from conflict to post-conflict context. As our main
                     contribution, we develop a bi-directional approach that employs the concept of collective
                     identity and allows us to examine the construction of populist agendas as a two-way
                     interaction between the leadership of a movement and its grass roots supporters. Through
                     this approach we show how the gender dimension was not merely a bi-product but central
                     to both the construction of the Maoist movement’s war time ‘progressive’ identity,
                     and the fragmentation of this identity and the movement’s populist appeal in the post-conflict
                     context.

            <p id="d1e112">With the rise in right-wing populist movements globally, there is increasing scholarly
               interest in this area. However, less attention has been paid to left-wing populist
               movements that contribute to the mobilization of marginalized groups for armed struggle,
               and within the existing scholarship, left-wing populism in South Asia remains particularly
               under-explored [<a href="#R1">1</a>]. Left-wing populist movements that propagate armed violence tend to rely on ideologies
               constructed on radical agendas of social and progressive transformation to make sense
               of and justify their means, frequently including a gender dimension [<a href="#R2">2</a>]. Building on critical feminist scholarship on populism, we explore this gender dimension
               not as an ‘add-on’ to the ideologies of left-wing, violent populist movements, but
               as a key factor in defining a populist movement in its left-wing or ‘progressive’
               orientation (see for example: [<a href="#R3">3</a>, <a href="#R4">4</a>, <a href="#R5">5</a>, <a href="#R6">6</a>, <a href="#R7">7</a>, <a href="#R8">8</a>]). We argue that the gender dimension plays a crucial role in both constructing the
               identity of a populist movement and determining the support it can garner and retain
               over time.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e139">Concurring with feminist scholarship on left-wing populism we recognize how populist
               movements rely on a position of ‘sameness’ when appealing to a generalized ‘people’,
               resulting in erasing differences and inequalities <i>within</i> the ‘in-group’ [<a href="#R9">9</a>, <a href="#R10">10</a>, <a href="#R11">11</a>]. However, our innovation in adding to this scholarship is to question how women
               contribute to, as well as contest, the gender agendas of such movements, including
               a movement’s potentially homogenizing rhetoric? In addressing this question, we develop
               a bi-directional approach that examines the construction of populist agendas as a
               two-way interaction between the leadership of a movement and its grass roots supporters.
               Taking this approach, we draw on the concept of ‘collective identity’ in understanding
               the construction and fragmentation of a populist movement over time, centring on the
               transition from conflict to post-conflict [<a href="#R10">10</a>, <a href="#R12">12</a>]. A bi-directional approach allows us then to examine how women both contribute to
               the development of the gender agenda and contest rhetorical homogenization at different
               stages of the conflict, affecting the movement’s populist appeal over time [<a href="#R13">13</a>, <a href="#R14">14</a>, <a href="#R15">15</a>, <a href="#R16">16</a>, <a href="#R17">17</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e175">To address these questions, our empirical analysis is focused on the Maoist movement
               in Nepal during the People’s War (1996-2006) and the period of post-war transition.
               The People’s War was initiated by the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) (CPN(M)) who
               led the armed uprising against what they defined as the ‘exclusionary’ state [<a href="#R18">18</a>, <a href="#R19">19</a>, <a href="#R20">20</a>]. The party and its military wing, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), secured widespread
               support from large sectors of the population, especially from the economically marginalized,
               ethnic minorities, and those from deprived areas away from the capital. The movement
               also garnered strong support from women, and many joined the ranks of the PLA. Part
               of the CPN(M)’s success was its progressive appeal, which promised a radical change,
               including eradication of all forms of discriminations based on gender, caste, class,
               ethnicity and religion [<a href="#R10">10</a>, <a href="#R21">21</a>, <a href="#R22">22</a>, <a href="#R23">23</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e199">In framing the Maoist movement as a populist movement, we draw on Laclau’s conceptualization
               of populism as a discursive construct that has a particular form: it is organized
               around a dichotomy between ‘us the people’ and ‘the other’ [<a href="#R24">24</a>]. We then show how the Maoist agenda of class-struggle, constructed around the dichotomy
               between the ‘oppressed’ and the ‘elite’, relied on a specific gender agenda. Whilst
               the gender agenda was constructed in ways that produced sameness—homogenizing women
               as a category within the broader oppressed ‘people’- we argue that during the time
               of war this gender agenda was largely successful. That is, it contributed to the legitimization
               of the movement’s ‘progressive’ appeal and reinforced a sense of collective identity
               that crossed gendered and hierarchical lines amongst cadre and supporters [<a href="#R10">10</a>, <a href="#R12">12</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e210">However, in the post-conflict context, when the Maoist party grappled with maintaining
               political power as it entered mainstream politics, the sense of collective identity
               amongst supporters began to fragment, and although the party still maintained significant
               political support, it was unable to retain its populist appeal. We argue that one
               of the key factors in this fragmentation, is the way in which the Maoist agenda shifted
               to no longer being relatable to many of the women that supported the movement during
               the war. This led to some women withdrawing from the movement or finding new ways
               to seize the legacy of the Maoist rhetoric of gender equality [<a href="#R25">25</a>]. We argue that taken together, these ways in which women have enacted upon the legacy
               of the Maoist movement has contributed to the deconstruction of the wartime collective
               identity and its ‘progressive’ identity, and ultimately the demise of the movement
               as populist.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e215">After providing insight into the methodology, the article proceeds by first constructing
               an analytical framework situated in the literature on populism and collective identity,
               before integrating feminist literature on populism, conflict and post-conflict transitions.
               Following our theoretical discussion, we embark on an empirical analysis of how the
               Maoist gender agenda was constructed and relied upon to claim a ‘progressive’ identity,
               during the period of conflict in Nepal. Taking a bi-directional approach, we reveal
               how this agenda was not purely constructed by the leadership, but how grassroots women
               also played a crucial role in shaping the agenda; an agenda that relied on both the
               homogenization of women as a group, and ‘sameness’ in terms of women taking on ‘masculine
               roles’ as a measure of emancipation. In the second empirical section, we shift to
               a discussion of the post conflict context. We explore the role that women play in
               the fragmentation of the wartime collective identity, by examining how ex-PLA women
               in the lower echelons of the movement started to withdraw their support and contest
               the wartime homogenizing discourses. We show how this contributes to the decline of
               the movement’s populist appeal, thus exposing the crucial role of gender in the construction
               and fragmentation of left-wing populist movements.

            <p id="d1e220">To examine shifts and tensions in Maoist populism across the temporalities of conflict
               and post-conflict this article takes a collaborative approach, synthesizing empirical
               research from the three author’s complimentary research projects carried out between
               2011-2018. This allows us to draw from a combined bank of over 100 in-depth interviews
               with women and men ex-combatants, civil society members and Maoist female politicians.
               Besides allowing us to cover specific timeframes, our collaborative approach produces
               nuanced insights into how the wartime populist discourses are experienced by the lower
               echelons [<a href="#R26">26</a>] of the movement. To examine the discourses of the Maoist leadership we also draw
               on secondary sources. Our two main sources include <i>The Worker</i>, an English-language publication disseminated by the CPN(M) and a Maoist Nepali-language
               publication <i>Janadesh</i>, more widely read across Nepal [<a href="#R27">27</a>]. These sources, combined with interviews with female Maoist politicians, allow us
               to examine the forms of femininities and masculinities that were constructed and employed
               to mobilize Nepal’s rural population, and to highlight how the official discourses
               construct the dichotomy between ‘people’ and the ‘elite’ over time.

            <p id="d1e237">Although conceptualizations of populism remain contested, more broadly there is general
               agreement that it refers to a political endeavour that is built around the dichotomy
               of ‘us—the people’ versus ‘them—the elite’ (E.g. [<a href="#R28">28</a>, <a href="#R29">29</a>]). A prominent approach in the literature conceptualizes populism through an ideational
               perspective. This approach understands populism as a ‘thin-centred ideology’ that
               can be attached to other ‘more complete’ ideologies that range across the political
               spectrum [<a href="#R28">28</a>, <a href="#R30">30</a>]. Another prominent approach frames populism as a specific form of political strategy,
               paying close attention to how strategies differ and evolve over time [<a href="#R31">31</a>]. However, the most relevant conceptualization for our analysis is the understanding
               of populism as a discursive style, drawn from Laclau’s work [<a href="#R24">24</a>]. This approach understands populism as a discursive construct that has a particular
               form: it is organized around a dichotomy between ‘us the people’ and ‘the other’ [<a href="#R24">24</a>]. Rather than being a substantive ideology populism is understood to contain an empty
               core. What therefore characterizes populist rhetoric is a chain of relational ‘empty
               signifiers’ through which the collective ‘us’ is delineated and gains its meaning
               [<a href="#R24">24</a>, <a href="#R29">29</a>, <a href="#R32">32</a>]. In the context of Nepal, the Maoist leadership used ‘empty signifiers’ such as
               defining themselves as ‘progressive’ or ‘humane’, representing a shift from the ‘backward’
               or ‘semi-feudal elite oppressors’ [<a href="#R33">33</a>]. This gave meaning to the Maoist populist agenda that constructed a vision of a
               ‘<i>Naya</i> (New) Nepal’, promising equality and dignity to its supporters.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e277">Within the burgeoning literature on populism, the main focus of analyses tends to
               be political parties or their leaders; much attention has been paid to Hugo Chavez
               and the United Socialist Party of Venezuela, or La Pen and her French National Front.
               However, top-down approaches may overlook the important role that grassroots organizations
               play in institutionalizing populist movements and constructing populist agendas [<a href="#R34">34</a>, <a href="#R35">35</a>]. Given that party-led populism may emerge as a ‘corollary of its bottom-up incarnation’,
               Aslandis argues that a more complete understanding of populist movements can be developed
               through also engaging with the interactions between a populist leadership and their
               grassroots support base [<a href="#R35">35</a>]. For example, previously ‘expressed grievances, or ‘demands’ at the grassroots level
               may be adopted and articulated through a populist leadership that ‘infuses them with
               political importance, cultivating an appetite for action’ [<a href="#R35">35</a>].
               
            </p>
            <p id="d1e291">Panizza argues that populism can be understood as a mode of political identification;
               that populist movements give meaning to ‘the people’ as a political actor, which is
               set in opposition to the antagonistic identity of the ‘elite’ or ‘other’ [<a href="#R34">34</a>]. Despite the diversity of identities encompassed within understandings of ‘the people’,
               the populist project aims at constructing a ‘single, homogenous identity’ [<a href="#R36">36</a>] that tends to revolve around the nodal point of the anti-elite. Laclau has termed
               this as the ‘politics of equivalence’ [<a href="#R24">24</a>]. It draws ‘dispersed elements (agents, ideas, practices, demands) into a discourse
               by reinforcing what they have in common (their ‘‘equivalence’’ or sameness),’ [<a href="#R34">34</a>] and thus simplifies the political space between the two antagonistic camps [<a href="#R24">24</a>]. Taking account of constructions of ‘sameness’ within populist discourse highlights
               how the reformulation of these constructions may contribute to breaking down traditional
               societal divisions between disparate identity groups, in order to place them within
               the sphere of ‘the people’. In doing so, this has the potential to elevate the demands
               or grievances of varying identity groups within the broader antagonisms pitted as
               the ‘anti–people’ or elite. As part of this agenda, gendered grievances may be included.
               However, what is problematic is that women’s grievances are often defined in terms
               of sameness, leading to a conceptualization of ‘women’ as a homogeneous group [<a href="#R6">6</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e312">In Nepal, the core of Maoist populist appeal was their claim to be supporting ‘the
               people’ who were ‘oppressed’ by the elite as a result of varying identity markers
               such as caste, ethnicity, gender, as well as the exclusion of these groups from the
               urban centre or positions of influence. Within their populist ambitions, the Maoist
               leadership was successful in bringing the grievances of multiple ‘oppressed’ identity
               groups under one ‘class’ banner, through which to justify violent action against the
               so-called ‘elite’. Those defined as ‘oppressed groups’ were those from marginalized
               castes or indigenous populations [<a href="#R37">37</a>, <a href="#R38">38</a>], rural populations not aligned to the elite, as well as women. Operationalized together
               ‘the oppressed’ became the ‘us’, ‘the people’ that need to be emancipated, versus
               the ‘oppressive state’.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e320">The salience of the ‘us’ and ‘them’ rhetoric was also key to the development of a
               salient sense of collective identity amongst supporters and particularly amongst members
               of the People’s Liberation Army. In social movement literature, collective identity
               is understood as the critical link between ‘social identity (at the individual and
               group level) and collective action’ [<a href="#R39">39</a>]. Collective identity stems from the development of a common identity associated
               with a particular social group, in such a way that identity of ‘I myself’ is merged
               into the group ‘we’ [<a href="#R40">40</a>]. In social movements, the group identity is constructed on collective action, which
               also incorporates group goals, ideology, norms and values. Group members engage with
               this identity and seek to uphold it via an ‘active process of shaping and forging
               an image of what the group stands for’, what it wishes to achieve, and ‘how it wishes
               to be viewed by others’ [<a href="#R39">39</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e331">Constructing collective identity is a crucial function of ‘social movement entrepreneurship
               and populism constitutes an exemplary case of identity mobilization under the inclusive
               banner of ‘the people’ [<a href="#R35">35</a>]. Key to this is the ability of leaders to identify with ‘the people’ and their realities—or
               ‘flaunt the low’ as termed by Ostiguy [<a href="#R41">41</a>]. In the CPN(M), the leadership was particularly effective in its ability to appear
               attuned to the grievances of specific groups, which was key to gaining trust amongst
               a variety of groups and constructing a collective identity that was inclusive of both
               ‘the people’ and the leadership. In interviews carried out by author 1 with both male
               and female ex-PLA, interviewees frequently expressed how, during the war, they felt
               like the leadership had the people’s interests as a priority and ‘could be trusted’,
               also commenting on how all cadre were encouraged to speak out and criticize in group
               discussions. As expressed by a male ex-PLA,
            </p>
            <p id="d1e339">
               <i>If a commander made a mistake we could raise that issue and ask for clarification.
                  Everyone was allowed to point out the weaknesses of a commander. Even the commanders
                  used to encourage us to figure out the weakness so that the person could improve themselves.
                  It was a vice versa process, members could criticize commanders, and commanders too
                  could point out the mistakes of members</i> [<a href="#R42">42</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e347">Similarly, as written elsewhere, the level of commitment to the Maoist ideology amongst
               cadre from diverse backgrounds was instrumental in constructing a sense of collective
               identity that crossed caste, ethnic, gendered and hierarchical boundaries [<a href="#R10">10</a>]. In referring to the idelogy as a bonding mechanism, another ex-PLA member noted
               that,
            </p>
            <p id="d1e352">
               <i>After being a part of the organization (PLA), there was no chance of dividing each
                  other into the categories of various social groups such as Dalits or women. Women
                  and Dalits both fulfilled their responsibilities and what made the organization strong
                  was the criticism and review done at the end of each day</i> [<a href="#R43">43</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e360">This sense of equality, therefore, was aided by a belief that the leadership were
               themselves participating in the same struggle and both furthered a sense ‘equivalence’
               amongst recruits, and also facilitated the bi-directional relationship between the
               lower and upper echelons in the construction of the progressive identity.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e363">Yet in post-conflict, the question remains as to what happens to the collective identity
               of ‘the people’ in the transition of a populist movement into a position of government.
               Panizza has argued that ‘the people’ takes on a different meaning when a populist
               leader, initially situated outside the government, enters mainstream politics, previously
               constructed as the realm of ‘the elite’ [<a href="#R34">34</a>]. The leadership is no longer seen as ‘flaunting the low’, in Ostiguy’s terms, and
               thus becomes disconnected from the identity of ‘the people’; instead merges with what
               was once portrayed as ‘the elite other’ [<a href="#R41">41</a>]. This has implications for the multiple identities that were previously included
               in ‘the people’ and may lead to the re-orientation of inclusions and exclusions. It
               also has implications for the sense of collective identity experienced by participants
               to the movement during the conflict. This is particularly important in the case of
               Nepal where the shift from conflict to the post-conflict context led to a change in
               the positioning of Maoists from a revolutionary warring party, fighting on behalf
               of the people, to a mainstream political party, with an ambition to stay in power.
               As such, we pay close attention to how ‘the people’ are portrayed within the post-conflict
               political goals of the leadership and juxtapose this with the way the ‘collective’
               is experienced and contested by women ex-PLA as new hierarchies and needs emerge.
               This allows us to expose the role that the gender positive agenda plays in the fragmentation
               and redefining of the movement away from its populist origin in post-conflict.

            <p id="d1e374">The analysis of the relationship between gender and populism in political science
               literature tends to approach gender as a demographic factor or as a variable that
               can be measured. For example, gender has been invoked to study the ‘gender gap’ in
               electoral support for Right Wing Political Parties (E.g. [<a href="#R44">44</a>, <a href="#R45">45</a>]) or as a variable in accounts that seek to establish regional comparisons and/or
               comparisons between left and right populism [<a href="#R46">46</a>]. Whilst such deployment of gender has its merits, what goes missing is the gendered
               nature of populism <i>per se</i> (when stripped of its ‘host’ ideology and the national culture in which it operates)
               [<a href="#R4">4</a>]. In contrast, an emerging field of feminist scholarship reveals how constructions
               of masculinity and femininity and framings of gendered hierarchies are at the core
               of how populism as an ideological construct operates (E.g. [<a href="#R5">5</a>, <a href="#R47">47</a>, <a href="#R48">48</a>]). Maiguascha argues that ‘[i]n a totalising politics of ‘us’ vs ‘them’ there is
               no space or incentive to inquire into the internal conflicts or hierarchies that shape
               each camp or the way that gender might differentially impact on the lives of women
               and men in material ways as lived experience’ [<a href="#R4">4</a>]. Whilst the existing feminist contributions differ in their conceptualizations of
               populism, there is a broad agreement that the opposition between ‘us’ and ‘them’ requires
               feminist scrutiny of how gendered power relations are implicated—entrenched, mobilized
               or possibly navigated—in such a construction and in the politics it enables [<a href="#R2">2</a>, <a href="#R49">49</a>]. The strengthening of the populist right in Europe and in the US and the emergence
               of right populist parties touting explicitly anti-feminist agendas has generated urgent
               scholarly engagement [<a href="#R49">49</a>, <a href="#R50">50</a>, <a href="#R51">51</a>]. Crucially, there is also an emerging strand of feminist analysis that addresses
               right populism in the context of South Asia [<a href="#R7">7</a>, <a href="#R8">8</a>, <a href="#R52">52</a>]. In contrast, the role of gender in left populism, and the relation between left
               populism and feminism specifically, is scarcely researched. The few existing studies
               reveal a complex picture. In a comparative study of left populism in Spain (Podemos)
               and right populism in Finland (The Finns), Kantola and Lombardo argue that political
               ideology matters. They suggest that ‘left-wing parties, though populist, are still
               better allies of feminist politics than right-wing parties both in terms of empowerment
               and transformation’ [<a href="#R6">6</a>]. Yet, their multi-dimensional analysis also shows that the ‘ethos of hegemonic masculinity’
               endures in left populism, apparent in ‘informal gendered institutions’ (such as gender
               norms) and in the bellicose and confrontational style of politics that both of the
               populist parties under scrutiny articulate. Moving beyond the context of political
               parties, Emejulu reveals a problematic relation between left populism and feminism
               also in grass root organizing [<a href="#R3">3</a>]. Examining left and right populism in the US, she shows how in the progressive populist
               discourse feminist claims are reconstructed from ‘social justice’ to ‘special interest’
               claims, a move which labels feminism as an ‘unrepresentative expression of elite partisan
               interests’ [<a href="#R3">3</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e439">What appears clear from the feminist analysis is that left populism, when appealing
               to a generalized ‘people’, is not exempt from the charge of erasing differences and
               inequalities, with potentially divisive issues such as gender and race being silenced
               for the sake of unity or numerical majority [<a href="#R6">6</a>]. To examine how this gendered character of left populism, specifically it’s tendency
               to homogenize, evolves through war to post-war transitions, we build on feminist scholarship
               on peace and conflict.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e444">Feminist peace and conflict scholarship offers crucial insights into conceptualizing
               both the contested question of women’s agency within violent populist movements and
               the temporality of the post-war context. At the core of feminist scholarship on war
               is the acknowledgement that gendered discourses are invoked to legitimize war—to make
               war intelligible [<a href="#R53">53</a>]. For example, in Nepal mobilization for violence was underpinned by the production
               of specific femininities and masculinities—for instance representations of women as
               an oppressed group ready to stand up and fight against their oppressor, or defining
               men as ‘brave warriors’ dedicated to fight for a new and more progressive nation [<a href="#R54">54</a>, <a href="#R55">55</a>]. Building on this, rich feminist scholarship explores how women who participate
               in non-state armed groups engage with such gendered discourses, whether in context
               of ethno-nationalism or class struggle (E.g. [<a href="#R56">56</a>, <a href="#R57">57</a>, <a href="#R58">58</a>]). The question of instrumentalization emerges as central, as the feminist analyses
               have exposed the ways in which agendas of gender equality and indeed women’s participation
               are often strategically promoted by the leadership of such movements to broaden their
               recruitment pool and to garner popular appeal [<a href="#R59">59</a>, <a href="#R60">60</a>]. We build specifically on feminist work that has examined how women interpret these
               militant agendas and conceive of their own contribution, including how the agenda
               of ‘sameness’ constructed during conflict period may provide a platform for women
               to contest the populist agenda in the post-conflict context [<a href="#R14">14</a>, <a href="#R61">61</a>, <a href="#R62">62</a>, <a href="#R63">63</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e484">A prominent strand of feminist literature conceptualizes the ‘postwar moment’ [<a href="#R64">64</a>] as one of fragile opportunity. In this interpretation the myriad roles in which
               women engage in war, including as fighters and political organizers, may instantiate
               reconfigurations of gender norms, and therefore create possibilities for transforming
               gendered relations of power, leading to various ‘ambivalent gains’ [<a href="#R65">65</a>]. A crucial theme in the literature is the prevalent threat of a post-conflict ‘backlash’,
               a dynamic that involves a violent reinstating of regulatory gender norms (E.g. [<a href="#R66">66</a>, <a href="#R67">67</a>]). What remains less explored, are the complex legacies that women’s participation
               in a militant movement generates, and how these legacies may be enacted upon when
               the armed struggle is over [<a href="#R57">57</a>, <a href="#R68">68</a>]. We explore how women who are in various ways positioned within the Maoist movement
               navigate and contest exclusions and hierarchies that start to emerge in the post-war
               context. Such negotiations result in both, a withdrawing a way from the movement,
               as well as finding new ways to seize the legacy of the Maoist populist rhetoric of
               gender equality in the realm of parliamentary politics. We argue that taken together,
               these ways in which women have enacted upon the legacy of the Maoist movement in the
               post-war context significantly contribute to the deconstruction of the movement’s
               populist appeal.

            <p id="d1e508">This section examines gender as central to the ways in which ‘the people’ was constructed
               and delineated in the Maoist populist rhetoric during war. We argue that the way gender
               equality was framed as a key demand of the ‘people’ within the rhetoric of the high-level
               leadership, and the way women were portrayed as a specific oppressed group amongst
               others, was significant in defining the movement as progressive and representing the
               aspirations of a <i>Naya</i> Nepal. What is crucially highlighted in this section is that the portrayal of women
               in the populist agenda was built around ‘sameness’; both amongst women, and in terms
               of the way women were celebrated as taking on masculine roles ‘within PLA’. However,
               while problematic in terms of recognizing intersectionality and the diverse needs
               of women [<a href="#R14">14</a>] in the extraordinary circumstances of conflict, this position of sameness actually
               facilitated the construction of a collective identity that transcended gendered boundaries
               and contributed to the success of the movements’ populist appeal during the war. Importantly,
               however, we highlight that the way women’s emancipation was incorporated into the
               Maoist agenda was not purely driven by leadership ambition or instrumentalization
               but was the product of a bi-directional relationship between the leadership and grassroots
               women.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e516">The Maoist position on women’s emancipation was framed within the overarching focus
               on ‘class-struggle’, which facilitated the use of ‘the oppressed’ as the nodal point
               on which ‘the people’ were conceptualized [<a href="#R38">38</a>, <a href="#R69">69</a>]. The rhetoric from the leadership constructed a narrative of ‘women as an oppressed
               group’ in which women’s emancipation became part of the defining identity of the movement
               as ‘progressive’. This was contrasted with backward and ‘semi-feudal’ framing of the
               state who were portrayed as responsible for women’s oppression. In an article written
               in 2003 by the head of the women’s department, Comrade Parvati, she defines women
               as ‘doubly oppressed’ [<a href="#R70">70</a>], by both the semi-feudal political system and patriarchy, the latter of which was
               understood as a product of the former (Also see [<a href="#R54">54</a>]). Maoist rhetoric would make reference to how women’s oppression is rooted in patrilineal
               ‘relations of land-ownership’, and social norms around marriage and the family that
               renders women subject to widespread economic, social and political marginalization
               [<a href="#R71">71</a>]. In an earlier article from 1999 Comrade Parvati explains how certain women have
               contributed to multiple nationalist struggles in the history of the Nepali state,
               but notes that ‘[I]t was only after CPN (Maoist) started the People’s War that women
               from grassroots, mainly rural women, started getting mobilized [<a href="#R71">71</a>]’. In this statement it portrays the CPN(M) as the ‘progressive’ platform for women’s
               emancipation via the vision of a <i>Naya</i> Nepal in which all women would be freed from their oppressed status. In <i>Reports from the Battlefield</i> from the 1998 Worker magazine, it stated that, ‘The heroic exploits of hundreds of
               women who have joined the guerrilla squads and defence groups have been a source of
               inspiration and favourable anecdotes throughout the country [<a href="#R72">72</a>]’. In emphasizing how the party was attuned to the needs of women, they claimed that
               ‘The fact that women are the most inspired group emerging in the last 2 years of People’s
               War itself indicates a definite victory for the Nepalese revolution’ (cited in [<a href="#R73">73</a>]). This position did not address the differences in women’s needs or status as it
               intersects with caste of ethnicity, which has rightfully been a key critique of the
               ostensibly gender positive agenda of the CPN(M) [<a href="#R10">10</a>, <a href="#R14">14</a>, <a href="#R38">38</a>, <a href="#R74">74</a>]. Nevertheless, the ‘sameness’ position as invoked in the ‘women as an oppressed
               group’ narrative, was crucial in defining the movement’s ‘progressive’ populist appeal.
               It served to invoke a discourse through which the party was portrayed as speaking
               on behalf of the ‘downtrodden’ and was a key link in ‘the chain of equivalence’ that
               pitted the ‘people’ as represented by the CPN(M) versus the so-called ‘exclusionary
               state.’
            </p>
            <p id="d1e562">Yet although it was the leadership through which the gender agenda and its homogenizing
               position was articulated, it is important to also recognize the role of grassroots
               women in constructing and reifying the agenda. The All Nepal Women’s Association (Revolutionary)
               (ANWA(R)), who were aligned to the party and whose membership included grassroots
               women, were key in ensuring that the multiple harms and discriminations against women
               were recognized, exposed, and challenged by the party. In the early years (ANWA(R))
               were involved in campaigning in the villages against alcohol abuse, which they identified
               as one of the key drivers of domestic violence in the rural areas [<a href="#R69">69</a>, <a href="#R75">75</a>, <a href="#R76">76</a>]. As a result, an alcohol ban was implemented in the Maoists heartlands, and later
               became policy in other areas under Maoist control, as well as being imposed as policy
               amongst Maoist personnel [<a href="#R54">54</a>, <a href="#R77">77</a>]. ANWA(R) were also involved in pushing for policies banning polygamy, child marriage
               and dowry. They rejected the norms of son preference and encouraged village women
               not to participate in festivals such as <i>Teej</i>, where women are expected to fast in honour of their husbands. In the Maoist publication
               <i>Janadesh</i>, an article from 1997 written by member of ANWA(R) exemplifies their advocacy on
               this issue,
            </p>
            <p id="d1e586">
               <i>The concept of the Teej festival is that women are to be kept as a slave for men and
                  for his house. Women are kept as childbearing machines, toys for men that they can
                  play with her physically or emotionally. This festival is about keeping women as objects.
                  Because of our efforts, Teej now becomes the day of exposing how married women are
                  treated in her own house</i> [<a href="#R78">78</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e594">Beyond ANWA(R), other grassroots women and student groups were also involved in defining
               Maoist approaches to challenging gender discriminations. In an interview with a former
               leader of one of the Women’s Fronts, author 1 was told how grassroots women contributed
               to the reformulation of Maoist policy to combat the harmful practice of <i>Chhaupadi</i> in the Far West region [<a href="#R79">79</a>]. This practice banishes women and girls from the home during menstruation and they
               are forced to sleep in a small hut, leaving them exposed to multiple harms [<a href="#R80">80</a>]. She described how the Maoists first used to destroy the huts, but were informed
               by local women that this had a detrimental impact as girls were then made to sleep
               outside. Instead, the Women’s Front, together with local women, participated in a
               15-day protest against the practice, marching through numerous villages, under the
               slogan of ‘we have to open your minds and break down the hut’.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e605">Women also contributed to shaping the agenda purely by joining the movement and legitimizing
               the way the ideology was perceived as addressing their needs. As explained by one
               former PLA women, ‘I joined the Maoist movement when I was a student. I had seen women’s
               sufferings due to violence, poverty, dowry, polygamy and so on. I wanted to do something
               about it so I joined the Maoist party’ [<a href="#R81">81</a>]. This was a position found in multiple interviews with ex-PLA women carried out
               by all three authors, where women expressed that gender-based violence and gender
               discriminatory norms had been important reasons for them to join the Maoist moment.
               Thus, although the leadership may have been the mouthpiece for articulating the oppression
               of women, women at the grassroots level also contributed to shaping both the rhetorical
               agenda and, in some cases, the manner in which actions for women’s emancipation were
               implemented.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e610">Recruitment campaigns became more targeted towards women after the second year of
               the war, and although there is no exact data available, it is estimated that by the
               end of the conflict between 33%- 40% of the ranks were populated by women. Key to
               understanding the success of the movement is recognizing the ability of the leadership
               to create a sense of collective identity within the ranks that crossed both gender,
               caste, ethnic or hierarchical boundaries. Recruits were instructed to refer to each
               other as ‘comrade’ or address each using respectful language regardless of gender,
               caste or status in the institution [<a href="#R82">82</a>]. In memories of quotidian life described in interviews with author 1, former combatants
               reminisced how cooking and cleaning were done on ‘rotation’. As noted by one ex-PLA
               woman, ‘work division was equal among both men and women. There was no discrimination’
               [<a href="#R83">83</a>]. In narratives of training and ‘battle’ both men and women ex-PLA spoke of how this
               was done ‘with both men and women together’ [<a href="#R84">84</a>]. For men this meant they experienced women carrying out activities what would normally
               only be associated with men and masculinity, which, at times was met with surprise
               at the physical capabilities of women [<a href="#R82">82</a>]. For male members of the PLA, it has been written that participation in the PLA
               produced a sense of being the ‘progressive’ man [<a href="#R10">10</a>], and is exemplified in how PLA compared themselves with the state forces. In interviews
               with ex-PLA men, it was found that, the collective identity of ‘us’—the forward-thinking
               protectors of ‘the people’—was frequently compared dichotomously with the ‘feudal’
               and ‘backward’ state forces, made up of the police and army. The state forces’ treatment
               of women was often cited as evidence of their backwardness and contrasted with PLA
               men’s own stories of respect for their female comrades and narratives of punishing
               villagers for the maltreatment of women [<a href="#R82">82</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e631">Thus the role that gender played in defining the sense of ‘us’ (the collective) as
               ‘progressive’ was experienced by both men and women recruits. In turn, the group identity
               associated with what was perceived as a reformist agenda in which recruits felt they
               had agency within, was instrumental in the maintaining cohesion and restricting defection
               in the PLA.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e633">There have been multiple critiques of the way in which women were defined by the Maoists
               in terms of a homogenous group [<a href="#R38">38</a>, <a href="#R74">74</a>], however, ‘sameness’ in the PLA also meant justifying women’s emancipation through
               demonstrating sameness (as men) in capabilities. Maoist propaganda tended to begin
               with addressing cadre as ‘the brave men and women of the People’s Liberation Army’
               [<a href="#R85">85</a>] emphasizing how a women’s capabilities were of no less than men and celebrating
               those who became ‘martyrs’ for the movement. Although this is problematic in terms
               of women’s realities, the ‘sameness’ position played a crucial role during the war
               in creating a sense of collective identity that was constructed around empowerment
               of the ‘oppressed’ and that fed into the populist ambition. This was a collective
               identity that may have been facilitated by the leadership, but women of the PLA also
               played a key role in its survival through their participation and through their visibility,
               willingly, taking on such roles. Here again it shows the contribution of women in
               the construction of a gender positive agenda espoused by the leadership, and which
               was instrumental in defining the Maoist identity as ‘progressive’ in how it represented
               ‘the people’.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e644">In examining the Maoist movement in Nepal in populist terms, this case is by no means
               exempt from feminist critiques of left-wing populism that expose the ‘ethos of hegemonic
               masculinity’ within them [<a href="#R6">6</a>]. Despite claiming a progressive agenda the Maoist leadership was predominantly populated
               by men who led in a style associated with stereotypical masculine norms, celebrating
               traits such as warriorhood, power and bravery [<a href="#R10">10</a>]. Moreover, it is well documented that some women both inside and outside of the
               movement were faced with harms or discriminations at the hands of the Maoists [<a href="#R86">86</a>]. However, this does not overshadow the platform it provided for women to contribute
               to the progressive agenda and the movement towards change, despite this agenda being
               constructed around ‘sameness’. The narrative of women as a ‘single oppressed group’
               that is guilty of erasing differences and inequalities between women, and places maleness
               as a measure of emancipation, may have worked during the period of conflict when there
               was a clear goal of overthrowing the state in order to institute a more progressive
               agenda. However, this narrative that is constructed around ‘sameness’ becomes no longer
               tenable in the post-conflict context. It is this shift that we now turn to.

            <p id="d1e658">In this section we examine how the movement’s gender agenda is constructed differently
               in the post-conflict context as the CPN-M enters parliamentary politics and the movement’s
               emphasis shifts from military to political goals. Our focus is explicitly on the bi-directional
               relationship between the leadership and the grassroots supporters through which the
               agenda is constructed, and how this relationship transforms in the post-conflict context.
               Through focusing on the contribution of the women ex-PLA combatants, engaged in the
               lower echelons of the movement, we show how the wartime collective identity starts
               to fragment as new hierarchies emerge along the lines of rank, including between women
               ex-PLA combatants. We argue that the way in which the women lower level cadres start
               to contest the wartime homogenizing discourses and to withdraw their support from
               the movement in crucial ways, contributes to the movement’s loss of its populist appeal.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e660">After the signing of the peace agreement in 2006 the Maoists joined mainstream politics
               and went on to win a landslide victory in the 2008 Constituent Assembly election.
               This resulted in Prachanda, the chairman of the CPN(M), shifting position from clandestine
               populist revolutionary to Prime Minister of the world’s youngest Republic. The rallying
               call of ‘us’ the new ‘progressive’ elite of the ‘people’, against ‘them’, the old
               elite, was instrumental in the election success. Election success can also be attributed
               to a wartime rhetoric of inclusion, taking account of a legacy of political exclusion
               along gender and caste/ethnic lines. The significant shift towards greater inclusion
               of women and marginalized caste/ethnic groups in formal politics in crucial ways resonated
               with the Maoist leadership’s wartime populist rhetoric of fighting ‘for the people’,
               including with the agenda of women’s liberation. As such, in entering the mainstream
               political process the party leadership was able to retain -at least on the surface-
               its populist discourse of inclusion, and the ways in which ‘the people’ was constructed
               in the populist rhetoric (See [<a href="#R87">87</a>]).
            </p>
            <p id="d1e665">The gains made regarding women’s entry into formal politics and broader women’s rights
               contrast with the prominent emphasis on backlash in feminist analysis of post-conflict
               contexts, in particular when women have contributed to militant movements [<a href="#R66">66</a>]. However, although the Maoist agenda brought more women into the political fora,
               inconsistencies in the agenda also began to emerge. For example, the CPN(M) included
               no women in the peace negotiations and in the development of a six-member committee
               founded to draft the Interim Constitution, there was initially no women nominated
               for inclusion. The women in the party, in particular ex-PLA high-level commanders
               who had entered parliamentary politics after the peace agreement, sought to hold the
               party leadership accountable regarding their wartime promises. This pressure was combined
               with protests by women’s rights organizations and broader coalitions of women politicians,
               that led to the inclusion of a 33% quote in the Constituent Assembly.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e670">Whilst crucial ‘gains’ [<a href="#R65">65</a>] were made with regard to including women’s increased participation in formal politics,
               what is striking, is the emerging disconnect between the political leadership and
               the agendas of the lower echelons of the movement, of which we take the women lower
               level cadres as an example. This disconnect led to the fragmentation of the collective
               identity that had upheld the party’s populist appeal and contributed to many women
               in the lower echelons stepping away from the movement and disengaging from party activities.
               This tendency to ‘withdraw’ [<a href="#R25">25</a>] from the movement emerged strongly in interviews that author 2 conducted in 2013,
               with women who had fought in the PLA as low-level commanders and foot soldiers. All
               the interview narratives were peppered with passionate critiques of the leadership
               of the party, with an emphasis on the non-recognition of the contribution of the lower
               level cadres (See [<a href="#R88">88</a>]).
            </p>
            <p id="d1e681">What was particularly striking, was how these critiques were directed also at the
               ‘women leaders’, women who had fought in the PLA as high-level commanders and had
               since the peace agreement entered parliamentary politics, becoming members of the
               CA. Ambika who had been a low level commander during the war expressed her thoughts
               about the ‘women leaders’ in this way,
            </p>
            <p id="d1e683">
               <i>What else changed for women? We have women leaders in the parliament [gives a list
                  of names of female politicians who had been high-level commanders in the PLA] and
                  all, what did they do? … They used to shout saying ‘women are not only made for household
                  chores, they can fight and handle bombs, bullets as well’, and ‘women are not slaves’
                  and many other things. At the end, everything remained same … What did they do? They
                  became rich, got luxury life, nobody bothered to care about us. Any republic or whatever
                  has come for the rich, nothing around for the poor</i> [<a href="#R89">89</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e691">What we argue is that these reflections demonstrate how the collective ‘we’ has started
               to fragment in the post-conflict context. First, new identifications start to emerge
               along the lines of rank, distinctions being made between the ‘lower level’ and ‘commanders’
               or the ‘lower level’ and the ‘leaders’. Second, whilst the wartime collective identity
               was organized around the notion of equality, in the post-conflict context the leadership’s
               commitment to this core principle becomes increasingly questioned. To us, Ambika’s
               reflections resonate with Panizza’s argument that ‘the people’ takes on a different
               meaning when a populist leader, initially situated outside the government, enters
               mainstream politics, previously constructed as the realm of ‘the elite’ [<a href="#R34">34</a>]. The leadership is no longer seen as ‘flaunting the low’ and thus becomes disconnected
               from their own constructed identity of ‘the people’ and instead merges with what was
               once portrayed as ‘the elite other’ [<a href="#R41">41</a>]. In intriguing ways Ambika’s reflections also highlight how the war time discourse
               that positioned ‘women’ as a homogenous group, based on their shared oppression, becomes
               contested when new hierarchies between women ex-PLA combatants start to emerge.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e699">The shifts in the relationship between the leadership and the lower echelons of the
               movement we seek to capture, are certainly entangled with broader changes in gendered
               power relations and norms that the post-conflict context generates [<a href="#R68">68</a>]. For example, in the context of Nepal, norms around motherhood became central to
               how the position of women ex-combatants was constructed in both discourses of the
               Maoist leadership and in the international discourses around peacebuilding [<a href="#R90">90</a>, <a href="#R91">91</a>]. As many of the PLA fighters who had married during the war or soon after the peace
               agreement, had children in the immediate aftermath of the war, the norms around childcare
               were debated and contested at different levels of the movement [<a href="#R92">92</a>]. It would be tempting then to connect women’s tendency to withdraw from the movement
               and party activities primarily with the restrengthening of gender norms in the post-conflict
               context, and specifically, how women ex-PLAs were positioned as primarily responsible
               for childcare. However, we argue that there is value in taking a step back and examining
               how the women ex-combatants understood their relation to the party in the post-conflict
               context, and how they conceived of their own contribution and the withdrawal of it.
               To do so it is illustrative to examine some of the concrete practices through which
               the women ex-PLA combatants were withdrawing their support.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e713">The fragmentation we examine had begun to translate into concrete practices through
               which lower level cadres were withdrawing their support to the party, including for
               election activities. A crucial election was held in 2013 for a second CA, after the
               first CA was dissolved in 2012, having failed to deliver a new constitution despite
               four extensions. The Maoists had held the majority of seats in the first CA and also
               held the premiership position for half of the term [<a href="#R93">93</a>], however, the election of the 2nd CA saw a major drop in seats to third place [<a href="#R93">93</a>]. An important factor [<a href="#R94">94</a>] impacting the election result was a greater number of voter abstentions from within
               the former Maoist cadre and reduced efforts within this cohort to mobilize grassroots
               voters to rally around the former populist leadership. The crucial role of women cadres
               in the reduction of Maoist votes emerged in author 2’s interviews.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e724">Renuka, who described herself as a ‘seasoned cadre’ explained that she had not voted
               and had refused to contribute to election activities in her home village, where she
               could have mobilized ‘100-150 people’ to vote. In reflecting upon her decision, she
               noted how the party no longer respected the contribution of the seasoned cadre—pointing
               out the party’s failure to offer economic support for her to travel to conduct election
               activities: ‘we cannot sit like beggars’. Yet, what was striking about Renuka’s narrative
               was how this refusal to contribute was combined with a continuing commitment to the
               ‘fight for the country’ and ‘fight for the people’,
            </p>
            <p id="d1e727">
               <i>We are still hopeful towards the party, the only thing is that we are still watching
                  and observing which politicians will do what… Who will raise the issues that were
                  of concern yesterday? Who is going to organize everyone together, we are going to
                  follow that leader. We are not going to leave it. … We have already brought changes
                  according to our capacity. Now we need to see what they will do</i> [<a href="#R94">94</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e735">Extending from Panizza, we argue that the kind of commitments and energies that the
               Maoist movement mobilized are not simply shaken off when the collective identity fragments
               and the movement starts to lose its populist appeal. Instead, they may take on new
               forms that do not necessarily resonate with the shifts in the discourses of the leadership.
               As Parashar amongst others highlight, what needs to be centred is how women active
               in militant movements interpret and contest agendas, including discourses of gender
               equality, and how these interpretations may shift in post-war contexts [<a href="#R57">57</a>]. In critiquing the leaders and in withdrawing their support, both Ambika and Renuka
               draw on their capacities as ex-fighters -and position themselves as those who had
               contributed to the struggle as part of the collective ‘we’. It is in her capacity
               as a seasoned cadre and as someone who has ‘brought changes’ that Renuka evaluates
               ‘who are the right leaders’ deserving of her support. Similarly, Ambika articulates
               her critique of the leadership in a language that directly draws on the specific discourses
               of women’s liberation propagated through the Maoist publications, simultaneously demonstrating
               fluency in this language and using it against the ‘women leaders’. With such a positioning
               she is able to question the sincerity of the leaders’ commitment to the struggle and
               to the women lower level cadres whom they had encouraged to fight.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e740">It is by centring the bi-directional relationship through which the populist discourse
               is constructed and deconstructed [<a href="#R35">35</a>], that we are able to highlight how the femininities produced in the war-time discourses
               are negotiated and contested by women in the lower echelons of the movement, and to
               point to the fractures in the collective identity as the leadership pursues parliamentary
               politics [<a href="#R34">34</a>]. In a context in which these fractures emerge along the lines of rank also between
               women ex-combatants, the homogenizing war time discourses that portray women as a
               group with shared interests and experiences of oppression becomes increasingly untenable.
               We argue that examining these contestations that target the leadership’s adherence
               to its own principle of equality—and the micro-level practices through which the lower
               level cadres withdraw support—is crucial in understanding how the movement starts
               to lose its populist appeal.

            <p id="d1e751">In this article we have illustrated the key role that gender agendas play in defining
               left-wing populist movements in their progressive orientation, examining the case
               of the Maoist movement in Nepal. We have framed the Maoist movement as a populist
               movement that produced and relied on a dichotomous construct of the people as the
               ‘oppressed’ versus ‘the elite’, and that propagated armed violence as a means of transformation.
               Our aim was to capture the central role that gender ideology played in defining the
               trajectory of the movement—in how the movement’s populist agenda was constructed,
               retained and fragmented—and to examine this trajectory across conflict and into a
               post-conflict context. As our main theoretical move, we have centred the bi-directional
               relationship between the leadership of populist movements and their grassroots supporters,
               by operationalizing the concept of collective identity. This has allowed us to offer
               the following key insights.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e753">First, we show how the populist agenda of the Maoist movement produced a homogenizing
               discourse of ‘sameness’ in two specific ways, first, in terms of how ‘women’ were
               integrated into the broader category of the ‘oppressed’ as a homogenous group, and
               second, how women were celebrated as taking on masculine roles within the PLA—as having
               the same capacities as men. We argue that unpacking this gendered, homogenizing discourse
               is central to understanding the trajectory of the movement across conflict to post-conflict
               stages. We illustrate how during the extraordinary circumstances of armed struggle,
               such homogenizing discourse had certain uptake and resonance amongst the grassroot
               supporters, and how it enabled the construction of a cohesive collective identity,
               especially within the PLA. We argue then that the movement’s populist appeal and its
               ability to retain support during the conflict was intricately linked to its gender
               agenda, and specifically, enabled by the way this agenda overwrote multiple forms
               of difference—both between women as well as within the PLA.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e755">Second, we demonstrate the importance of examining the construction of gender agendas
               of populist movements over time, by revealing the way in which the collective, progressive
               identity of the Maoist movement fragments in the post-conflict context. Centring the
               experiences of the women ex-PLA cadres, we are able to illustrate how new identifications
               start to emerge along the lines of rank as well as the concrete practices through
               which the women start to withdraw their support for the movement. These new identifications
               directly contest the homogenizing discourses that position ‘women’ as an oppressed
               group, with new hierarchies being are articulated between the ‘women leaders’, entering
               the realm of formal politics, and the lower level cadres.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e757">Our argument contributes to the feminist and critical approaches to populism by offering
               a more nuanced understanding of how gender agendas of left-wing populist movements
               are constructed and deconstructed through the participation of grassroot supporters
               over time. First, feminist approaches to populism have argued that left-wing populism—both
               at the level of political parties and grassroot movements—tend to silence feminist
               agendas and women’s lived experience to construct and retain the unity of the ‘people’.
               Whilst such analysis has crucial merit, it tells us less about how and why women may
               actively participate in the construction of such homogenizing agendas <i>and</i> as circumstances shift, contribute to their deconstruction. Second, whilst strands
               of the broader populism literature argue for centring the interactions between leadership
               and grassroot supporters to examine evolvement of populist movements, these accounts
               rarely focus on constructions of femininities and masculinities as central to the
               movement’s trajectory. By centring the gender ideology of the Maoist movement in our
               analysis, we are able to show how the construction of homogenizing discourse of ‘sameness’,
               was central to the movements success during war as well as its failure to retain populist
               appeal in the post-conflict context.
