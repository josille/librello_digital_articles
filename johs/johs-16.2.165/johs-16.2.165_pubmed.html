                  <p class="first" id="d1e99">In this article we discuss the comparative impact and significance of Community-Oriented
                     Policing (COP) in Central America (Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua). We emphasize
                     in particular the formal role of COP as a means to re-establish trust between the
                     state and community, demonstrate professionalism and to evidence the democratic accountability
                     of the police to the population. Although these formal goals remain the goal of community
                     oriented policing, we demonstrate in this article that there has been an increased
                     emphasis on more kinetic or militarized forms of policing in recent years. Hard handed,
                     heavily armed and interventionist police policies have spread from El Salvador to
                     Guatemala, and more recently Nicaragua. Moves towards more aggressive policing are
                     explained by governments and police forces as a necessary response to the rising threat
                     of gangs and drug cartels and horrifying levels of homicide statistics. However, as
                     we highlight there is also evidence of these changes reflecting undemocratic shifts
                     within national administrations and the repositioning of people within government
                     and national institutions with links to these countries' earlier military governments.The
                     net effect of these changes we argue is to erode the intentions of COP initiatives,
                     and severely reduce levels of trust and accountability between people and the democratic
                     state.

            <p id="d1e118">With the end of civil war and armed conflicts in Central America a new period of civilian
               and democratically elected government started in the 1990s. Elected governments were
               quick to announce that a new era of peace, security and economic growth had arrived.
               To ensure this new era, multiple reforms were made to secure the dissolution of the
               pre-existing security and law enforcement forces and their replacement by new civilian
               police institutions.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e120">In the years that followed, academics, international development organizations and
               some social leaders promoted community policing as synonymous with democracy given
               its emphasis on the construction of cooperative relations with the community, the
               prevention of crime and respect to human rights [<a href="#R1">1</a>]. The continuing efforts to introduce this kind of policing can also be interpreted
               as an effort to gain the trust of the public in the police, with basis in the idea
               that community policing constituted an effective manner to provide service to the
               public. The projects for community policing would develop with different characteristics
               and longevity, something that inspired critique from authors who questioned its long-term
               impact [<a href="#R2">2</a>]. As with other efforts to create institutional trust in the police, projects for
               community policing were developed through complex institutional systems, in which
               other actors and factors intervened other than just the police and public [<a href="#R3">3</a>]. Of these factors the most salient was the institutional persistence in the police
               forces of actors associated with previous authoritarian military regimes. This contributed
               to continued violence and would create an obstacle for the transformation of the police
               [<a href="#R4">4</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e134">Community policing (COP) constitutes a model for policing derived from a particular
               economic, social, and political context i.e., liberal democratic political systems.
               The literature written on the practice of the model takes for granted that there is
               a stable political context, and high levels of social cohesion [<a href="#R5">5</a>, <a href="#R6">6</a>]. It has been assumed that any resistance to the model will be produced internally
               within policing institutions themselves [<a href="#R7">7</a>, <a href="#R8">8</a>, <a href="#R9">9</a>, <a href="#R10">10</a>]. Acknowledging this, the comparative study of community policing in the country
               cases of Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Guatemala we will carry out in this article provides
               an important addition. In contrast to earlier writing, the context of a post-conflict
               era is seen to mould the results of attempts to reform policing. The structure of
               political power in each case explains the characteristics that the police acquire
               in Nicaragua, their marginalization from power in Guatemala and the co-existence of
               contradictory forces of community policing and the militarization of law enforcement
               in the context of El Salvador.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e155">In this article we discuss the comparative characteristics of police trust building
               efforts in three countries. All the countries have significant histories of armed
               conflict, and they all revamped their systems of security following the formal return
               of peace. In each context there has also been important support to the design and
               training for community policing. This has been given to the police and national police
               forces by international organizations and law enforcement specialists. Until recently,
               the international community praised the police command in these three countries for
               leading the way in developing systems for COP.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e157">In this article we argue and evidence through our focus on COP that although the period
               following armed conflict was one of democratic experimentation the results of this
               have ultimately been weak transitions. Indeed, in Guatemala and El Salvador the concept
               of ‘‘violent democracies’’ has been applied [<a href="#R11">11</a>] recognizing evidence of elevated levels of state violence and continuance in positions
               of power by members of the military and civilians that had been key actors in earlier
               dictatorial governments. Nicaragua has also lost its democratic direction in recent
               years with clear signs of presidential authoritarianism. These features explain why
               much of the international praise and support for COP strategies has now come to an
               end. Although COP models remain in action there has been an increased emphasis on
               militarized forms of policing in all three countries in recent years.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e162">Hard handed, heavily armed and interventionist police policies have spread from El
               Salvador to Guatemala, and more recently Nicaragua. These moves towards more aggressive
               policing are explained by governments and police forces as a necessary response to
               the rising threat of gangs and drug cartels and horrifying levels of homicide statistics.
               Central America continues to be one of the most violent regions of the world not at
               war [<a href="#R12">12</a>, <a href="#R13">13</a>, <a href="#R14">14</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e173">Our discussion of the experience of COP and other related policies in these contexts
               is based on substantial research carried out for the European Union Horizon 2020 financed
               project ‘‘Community Based Policing and Post-conflict Police Reform’’. In connection
               to this project a series of researchers, local and international research institutions
               have collaborated to carry out qualitative field research over a five-year period
               in different locations within each country. This research has involved the application
               of a series of methodologies including semi- structured interviews, questionnaires,
               focus groups, and participant-observation.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e175">In the pages below we will discuss the comparative experience of Community Policing
               as part of other trust building strategies focusing on three different stages in each
               country: the initial steps made to establish new civilian police forces and the first
               projects to engage the police with citizenry; detail and evidence of the functioning
               of COP in the field; and finally recent development in the rule of law and policing
               in each country. Our analysis assists improved understanding of the limitations confronted
               in the process of democratic police reform in post-conflict contexts and highlights
               the challenges faced by COP implementation in such situation.

               <!-- named anchor --></a><h2 class="main-title">2.- Community Policing and Trust in the Police in Post-Conflict Contexts</h2>
            <p id="d1e180">Community policing (COP) is a strategy developed and adopted with the specific goal
               of improving conditions of trust between the police and public. Its modern roots lie
               in the United States in the 1970s [<a href="#R10">10</a>, <a href="#R15">15</a>, <a href="#R16">16</a>], from where it spread into Canada and Europe, and on into Latin America, Africa,
               and Asia. Although Bayley [<a href="#R17">17</a>] argues that there is no agreed definition of COP there appear to be similar conditions
               [<a href="#R18">18</a>] for its testing and implementation i.e., it is a clear effort to respond to a lack
               of public confidence in the police. COP places an emphasis on the preventative role
               of the police in a closely defined geographic area i.e., the neighborhood. A second
               condition of the model is the promotion of close relations with the community with
               the goal of creating the basis for a continuous dynamic of consultation with local
               citizens, and responsiveness to local perceptions and priorities [<a href="#R19">19</a>]. This forms the basis of a focused strategy in which the police study the conditions
               of delinquency and crime at the local level, revises its priorities in response to
               the fears of the local community, and implements the resolution of both crime and
               broader social challenges with the neighborhood [<a href="#R20">20</a>] reducing levels of crime and related fears [<a href="#R21">21</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e207">Key sources on COP have focused on its impact, concluding that there is significant
               evidence that this strategy for policing improves local citizens perceptions of the
               police, their approval of their activities, their legitimacy as a state institution,
               but it has some limited impact on the levels of crime and related fears [<a href="#R22">22</a>]. In Latin America there are studies which focus on conditions for COP success [<a href="#R23">23</a>], as well as on problems of implementation [<a href="#R10">10</a>, <a href="#R24">24</a>, <a href="#R25">25</a>, <a href="#R26">26</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e228">Our approach is different, given that we have chosen to study COP acknowledging the
               significance of the political and social context in which it has been implemented.
               In this sense, we do not look to explain the strengths and weaknesses of the model
               of policing, but rather the processes that explain its eventual character in the three
               countries under study. In this respect, we argue that it is only with careful contextual
               analysis of the political and social context that we can fully understand COP’s implementation
               in each case, the reasons for their survival in parallel to increased militarization
               and their possible impact on the public confidence in the police. The histories of
               conflict and post-conflict in each of the countries under study are important points
               of entry to understand the background of community-oriented policing in each case,
               as part of trust building strategies.

            <p id="d1e230">Efforts to reform the police forces in Latin America multiplied throughout the region
               in the 1990s to separate police from the military, improve professional standards,
               curb police abuses, and improve police-community relations. The signing of the peace
               accords between the governments and armed opposition groups in El Salvador in 1992
               and Guatemala in 1996 was particularly significant to police reform in the region.
               In both cases, the peace accords stipulated the creation of new civilian police forces
               to replace the former police bodies that were subordinated to the armed forces. Police
               reformers comprised human rights activists, bilateral and multilateral international
               organizations, academics, and some government officials [<a href="#R27">27</a>, <a href="#R28">28</a>, <a href="#R29">29</a>]. Twenty years later, academic analysis that takes stock of the process considers
               its results disappointing [<a href="#R30">30</a>].

               <p id="d1e247">Trust as a concept plays an important role in police reform because a deficit of trust
                  in both government and the police are all too common in post-conflict societies [<a href="#R31">31</a>]. Goldsmith argues that the reform of the police in post-conflict contexts requires
                  substantive attention to the improvement of trust in the police and forces of law
                  and order. In contexts in which trust in the police is absent, he observes that it
                  has been impossible for the police to gain the legitimacy and consent from the public
                  needed to effectively carry out their duties. The perception of the public with respect
                  to the police has consequence in terms of a contribution to the nature of the relationship
                  between society and the state. Police presence is a representation of the existence
                  of the state in a location, and for that reason the public impression of their actions
                  has impact on the citizens trust and understanding of the state. In a democratic society
                  the legitimacy of the police and other public institutions act to reinforce the conformity
                  of citizens to the laws and norms that are represented by the police [<a href="#R32">32</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e255">Belief that COP will improve relations between the citizenry and the police, and the
                  effectiveness of policing has significance for understanding the consolidation of
                  democratic states in Central America. Several studies carried out in developed liberal
                  democracies conclude that trust depends on the perception of how justice is practiced
                  in citizens’ encounters with the police [<a href="#R33">33</a>, <a href="#R34">34</a>]. In the context of Latin America, Malone &amp; Dammert [<a href="#R35">35</a>] suggest that confidence in the police depends equally on the perception of the police
                  community relations, as it does on effectiveness and measurable results.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e266">The increase in violent crime can be interpreted to be a result of ineffective policing
                  and generate pressure for military personnel being assigned tasks in public security.
                  This is highly probable in countries that have an historical tradition for the participation
                  of the armed forces in the control of the citizenry and where they are recognized
                  as a force that can be actively used where the police are unable [<a href="#R12">12</a>]. Another effect of deficient policing is an increase in mistrust in the rule of
                  law and tendency towards increasing acts of vigilantism [<a href="#R36">36</a>, <a href="#R37">37</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e277">The efforts to implement community policing we describe here can only be discerned
                  within a theoretical frame of understanding in which the state is interpreted to be
                  a fundamental actor in the definition of politics but composed of diverse organizations
                  that may not have a singular or coherent interests and loyalties. It is only within
                  this frame that sense can be made of the co-existence of COP programmes and authoritarian
                  policing resulting in serious violations of human rights. At the same time, it is
                  of note that within police forces there has been the reproduction of debates and perspectives
                  that are antagonistic to the democratic rule of law.

                  <p id="d1e290">The 1992 Peace Accords and Security Reform promised a new democratic beginning following
                     12 years of civil war that had prioritized counter-insurgency strategies [<a href="#R38">38</a>]. The security reform mandated the creation of a new National Civil Police (PNC),
                     composed mainly of civilian personnel. For this purpose, the Peace Accords established
                     quotas to include, but limit, ex-combatants from both the dismantled public security
                     forces and the demobilized guerilla [<a href="#R39">39</a>]. A National Academy of Public Security (ANSP) was also created as an autonomous
                     civilian academic body mandated with the training of the new professional police force.
                     
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e298">These reforms did not completely transform the structures of power in the country.
                     The transition to democracy in El Salvador, like other countries in Central America,
                     visibly retained the shadow of groups that were intimately connected to the old political
                     order. The governing party ARENA (Alianza Republicana Nacional- Nationalist Republican
                     Alliance) was initially opposed to the removal of previous security institutions,
                     only to later include elements of these institutions in the new police force and new
                     national security arrangements [<a href="#R6">6</a>, <a href="#R40">40</a>, <a href="#R41">41</a>].
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e309">In the period following the armed conflict ex guerilla leaders were assassinated.
                     This led to the creation of an independent investigatory committee named the Joint
                     Group for the Investigation of Illegal Armed Groups with Political Motivations in
                     El Salvador. The evidence produced by the committee demonstrate that there were several
                     death squads still in operation in the country. These groups would also evolve to
                     carry out actions of social cleansing exterminating members of youth gangs (maras)
                     during the 1990s and initial years of the new millennium [<a href="#R42">42</a>].
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e314">While political violence declined, the aftermath of the peace agreements continued
                     to be very violent. Homicidal violence reached very high levels because of competition
                     among organized crime organizations trying to assert territorial control over cocaine
                     trade routes [<a href="#R43">43</a>]. Given the lack of police capacity in the 17 years following the peace accords,
                     the governments of ARENA reintroduced the armed forces into joint rural and urban
                     patrols with the national police and placed an emphasis on reactive policing in response
                     to increasing levels of crime. These actions can only be interpreted as a reversal
                     of the democratic reform of internal security intended by the peace accords. It is
                     important to note that this change to the police force also clearly reflects a lack
                     of prioritization of the police by the government.
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e319">Between 2003 and 2006 a highly militarized strategy i.e., <i>Mano Dura</i> (Iron Fist), and subsequently the <i>Super Mano Dura</i> strategy, were introduced. A War on Gangs was also initiated reversing the focus
                     of security from the citizens back to the state and identifying youth gangs as the
                     key source of insecurity in the country [<a href="#R44">44</a>, <a href="#R45">45</a>, <a href="#R46">46</a>]. Military intervention in the Salvadorian public security was justified by the reintroduction
                     of a newly formulated idea of the ‘public enemy’ and recycled war paradigms of security.
                     During these years violent practices became entrenched in policing. Young, poor, and
                     marginalized men continued to be targeted by the police through abusive practices
                     and the excessive use of force and violence. This led to a backlash that strengthened
                     the gangs and their mutation into more organized forms of crime. According to Jeannette
                     Aguilar [<a href="#R47">47</a>], after the Super Mano Dura plan the abusive practices of the police continued and
                     remained in police subculture. The police continued to target young poor and marginalized
                     men, resulting in a backlash that led to the strengthening of the gangs and their
                     mutation into more organized forms of delinquency.

                  <p id="d1e343">The election of Mauricio Funes supported by The Farabundo Martí National Liberation
                     Front (FMLN) the former guerrilla umbrella-organization brought a change of political
                     discourse and initiated a new period of development from 2009 until 2014. Commissioner
                     Carlos Ascencio, a former guerrilla leader was appointed police director at the beginning
                     of the FMLN presidential period. In his opening speech in 2009, he called for a re-evaluation
                     of the police’s development. He argued that strengthening the police required an institutional
                     self-critique of the initial conception of the police in close relation to the community
                     and proposed the introduction of an integral approach to security that prioritized
                     preventive measures and community-oriented practices [<a href="#R14">14</a>].
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e348">At the end of 2011 President Funes made changes in the Ministry of Justice and Security
                     replacing individuals previously identified with the guerrilla. Sonja Wolff has indicated
                     these changes were partly the result of US pressures, and partly the consequence of
                     the president fearing the FMLN was withholding information from him [<a href="#R48">48</a>]. For instance, Brigadier General Francisco Salinas was appointed as the Director
                     of the Police in 2012, replacing Commissioner Carlos Ascencio who had a COP approach.
                     The weak capacity of the police to control crime led to an increased role of the military
                     in public security. According to US estimates, around 8,000 soldiers were working
                     with the police in 2016 [<a href="#R43">43</a>, <a href="#R49">49</a>].
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e359">These changes constituted a contradiction in the country’s overall treatment of the
                     issue of security. Efforts were made to strengthen the orientation of the police towards
                     service to the public, but at the same time military participation in the provision
                     of public security was made permanent. Repressive actions by joint police and armed
                     force operations increased during the superseding period of President Sanchez Cerén
                     who also came from the FMLN (2014-2019).
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e361">A significant attempt to introduce police strategies directed to the service of the
                     citizenry was the Institutional Strategic Plan 2011-2021. The plan incorporated gender
                     diversity and vulnerable groups, including women, into the work of the police. In
                     2012, the LEIV or <i>Special Law for a Life Free from Violence</i> was introduced. Article 25 of the LEIV stipulates the creation of institutional units
                     for assisting female victims of violence. Following this mandate, the National Civilian
                     Police established a unit specializing in violence against women, as part of their
                     Office for Reporting and Attention to Civilians (UNIMUJER-ODAC for its Spanish acronym)

                  <p id="d1e369">COP was officially implemented following the appointment of Brigadier General Salinas
                     as the PNC’s general director. In this move the Salvadorean Police adapted the Brazilian
                     Police Pacification Units (UPP, in Portuguese), which placed communitarian-police
                     bases in territories controlled by organized criminal groups. In Rio de Janeiro and
                     other places where UPPs were implemented, organized crime networks were eradicated
                     by forceful police tactics and then community policing occupied the favelas introducing
                     a communitarian approach. In El Salvador the UPP became a source of inspiration for
                     the implementation of repressive tactics, especially in areas of disputed territory
                     controlled by gangs. According to Commissioner Hugo Ramírez, former sub-director of
                     Public Security, the Salvadorian model also exceeded the UPP’s model in the sense
                     that both prevention and law enforcement are implemented in parallel with one another
                     [<a href="#R14">14</a>].

                  <p id="d1e374">Since 2014 the contradictions between the discourse and the practice of security have
                     been increasingly evident with the incremental use of repression against the maras.
                     In 2014 103 presumed gang members were killed in confrontations with the police. This
                     figured climbed to 591 killed and 119 injured in confrontations in 2016 [<a href="#R51">51</a>]. In 2017, the government of the former guerrilla member Sanchéz Cerén promoted the
                     need for the militarization of the streets- with armored cars patrolling the capital
                     San Salvador.
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e379">A report published in 2017 based on a national survey indicates the lack of territorial
                     coverage of the police in the country at that time [<a href="#R52">52</a>]. A fifth of the people in the survey reported that there was nobody in clear charge
                     of security and that they did not know who was responsible for security in their neighborhood.
                     Close to 60% of respondents to the survey reported that it was the citizens themselves
                     that provided security in the neighborhood, with only 4.6% signaling other actors-
                     amongst them the military and gang members- were responsible for the security of the
                     area. These findings imply that a significant percentage of the population lacks police
                     protection or considers it absent. With regards to the operation of the police in
                     the community, only 24.3% of Salvadoreans polled responded that there was a plan for
                     community policing in their locality. Approximately the same percentage (25.5%) answered
                     that they know the officers assigned to look after and attend their neighborhood.
                     Knowledge regarding community policing is worse in the zone of Greater San Salvador.
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e384">These reported experiences suggest that community policing is practiced in the country,
                     but that this is done side by side with repressive measures such as the war on the
                     gangs. The coverage of the COP programme, and its capacity to provide protection to
                     individuals is limited.

                  <p id="d1e389">With the election of Nayib Bukele to the presidency in 2019 there was renewed hope
                     for a change in the administration of the country and the direction of security policy.
                     Bukele is young enough not to remember the civil war and is not currently affiliated
                     with the traditional governing political parties e.g., ARENA and FMLN. Despite the
                     widespread optimism, local human rights organizations were quick to highlight the
                     lack of clarity and transparency of Bukele’s new security agenda. The Territorial
                     Control Plan, a security plan that Bukele has defended since the beginning of his
                     administration, keeps the military presence in public security operations. Within
                     seven months of his taking power, Bukele ordered the police and military to surround
                     and close the National Assembly (Congress). This action was taken because the Constitutional
                     Chamber had opposed the approval for $109 million credit from the Central American
                     Economic Integration Bank (BCIE) and destined to fund the implementation of his security
                     plan. The government also entered a new process of negotiation and agreement with

                  </h4>
                  <p id="d1e414">Guatemala was the location of one of the longest and bloodiest civil wars in Latin
                     American history. More than 200,000 people were killed between 1960 and 1996, most
                     of them civilians, and 93 percent at the hands of the military. Another 50,000, an
                     estimated 5% of the population at the time, were displaced from their homes [<a href="#R54">54</a>]. During the conflict the National Police was an instrument of military intelligence
                     to suppress opposition, capturing, secluding, torturing and frequently eliminating
                     actual or alleged members of the resistance [<a href="#R55">55</a>]. The police’s collaboration with the military granted the governments with impunity
                     and prompted many more acts of abuse, including contract-killings and widespread corruption.
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e422">The Peace Accords of 1996 provided a blueprint to overcome the legacy of authoritarianism
                     and sought to reconfigure relations between state security institutions and the civilian
                     population in substitution of the militarized approach that had reigned during the
                     conflict. The <i>Agreement on the Strengthening of Civilian Power and the Role of the Army in a Democratic
                        Society</i> set the stage for the creation of a new national civilian police force in 1997. The
                     Agreement also required the reduction in the numbers of the army from 47,000 members
                     in 1996 to 15,000 in 2004 and dismantled the so-called ‘‘Civilian Self-Defense Patrols’’
                     i.e., community members who were forced to become vigilante collaborators with the
                     military command in rural areas.
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e427">During the internal war the army had contracted its services to protect populations
                     affected by the war and promoted self defence mechanisms whose structure and activities
                     were different in each region of the country. With the transition to formal democracy
                     these structures were reconverted into private security companies, self-defense groups
                     and vigilante organizations which participated in several instances of extra judicial
                     executions [<a href="#R56">56</a>, <a href="#R57">57</a>]. The army successfully maintained control of the Ministry of the Interior and blocked
                     several attempts at police reform.
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e435">The effort to reform the police in Guatemala was partial and frustrating. The army
                     as a corporation continued to hold positions of power in successive governments. The
                     political system was much less conducive to reforms than in El Salvador, given the
                     absence of strong political parties that could have held political authorities accountable
                     for their actions [<a href="#R58">58</a>]. The political strength of the FMLN in El Salvador allowed it to negotiate as an
                     equal with ARENA during peace negotiations. As opposition in Congress, FMLN monitored
                     the police reform measures taken by the government.
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e440">In Guatemala, the final phase of peace negotiations was carried out by the conservative
                     National Advancement Party (PAN), which had won presidential elections by a very small
                     margin and confronted a weak fiscal situation. President Álvaro Arzú personalized
                     the achievement of signing the peace accords and did not follow up with political
                     negotiations with other forces to make it a state-wide accomplishment. The <i>Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity</i> (URNG) had already been defeated militarily and did not achieve important support
                     in Congress after it was legalized as a political party. It thus became extremely
                     difficult for the new civilian police to emerge as a credible law enforcement institution
                     which respected and promoted the rule of law.
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e445">Soon after its establishment, President Alvaro Arzú’s government (1996 – 2000) increased
                     the size of the police force to 20,000 to achieve the widest deployment possible throughout
                     national territory. The Police Academy of the time was only able to train 500 recruits
                     at a time. The government opted to bring in the Spanish Civilian Guard (Guardia Civil),
                     to train the new force. The Civilian Guard opted to recruit elements from the disbanded
                     National Police, the Military Police, and the Finance Police into a new force to fulfill
                     the government’s formal quantitative goals, and with the hope they could be substituted
                     in the years to come. The lack of preparation for enrolment, the low wage levels,
                     and the consequent limitations in academic preparation and other capacities of the
                     new recruits resulted, however, in a failure to deliver a clear severance with the
                     repressive police culture of the past [<a href="#R59">59</a>].
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e450">During the administration of Alfonso Portillo (2000-2004) and the Guatemalan Republican
                     Front [<a href="#R60">60</a>], the police academy was cut by 20% and police chiefs and interior ministers were
                     frequently substituted. In line with security policy in El Salvador punitive ‘‘hard
                     fist’’ (mano dura) measures were taken against street gang members, including arbitrary
                     mass incarceration. This further alienated street gang (<i>Mara</i>) members, encouraged their connections in prison and strengthened their capacities
                     for criminal activities. Allegations of ‘‘social cleansing’’ plagued Oscar Berger’s
                     administration (2004 – 2008) ending with accusations against the Minister of the Interior,
                     the Police Chief and other high-level security sector authorities for extra-judicial
                     executions.
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e458">Pressure from human-rights defenders and international actors led the government to
                     agree to the creation of the UN International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala
                     (CICIG) which conducted several investigations into political corruption, including
                     the ‘‘La Línea’’ case that caused the resignation and indictment of the President
                     and Vice-president of the Republic [<a href="#R61">61</a>]. CICIG found that election campaigns were funded by up to 25 per cent by economic
                     elites, 50 per cent by ‘internal corruption’ and 25 per cent by funds originating
                     from organized crime [<a href="#R62">62</a>].

                  <p id="d1e469">During the years following the peace accords, the National Civilian Police developed
                     several projects for community policing in response to initiatives from international
                     donors. USAID provided support in 2005 for a community policing project focused on
                     improving the relationship between community members and the police. Another example
                     was the implementation in 2007 of the <i>Plan Cuadrante de Seguridad Preventiva</i> (Block Plan for Preventative Security) led by the Chilean Carabineros. The pilot
                     project was initiated in Zones 1 and 2 of Guatemala City and later in the towns of
                     La Antigua and Quetzaltenango. These foreign funded and contrasting efforts are illustrative
                     of the institutional weakness of the police. They did not constitute a clear model
                     for police reform in the country.
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e474">The sky-rocketing levels of homicides in the 2000’s led the administration of Álvaro
                     Colom (2008 – 2012) to establish a Police Reform Commission and appoint a human rights
                     defender, Helen Mack as president. The Commission established a dialogue with all
                     police officers, regardless of their hierarchy, aiming at transforming the militarized
                     culture within the institution. Yet, she found that senior officers were more reluctant
                     to support her views on democratic policing [<a href="#R63">63</a>]. The new body lacked the political authority to fully enact its technical proposals
                     and depended on the will of the Minister of Governance- a position that was frequently
                     changed. The Commission was also perceived by senior police officers as an intrusion.
                     The Commission lasted until 2018 without achieving its intended objective.
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e479">Even under these difficult circumstances, the PNC attempted to strengthen itself as
                     an institution. A new strategy document was released, and the police academy was reopened
                     in 2011. Two other regional academies were also created i.e., in Huehuetenango in
                     the west of the country and Santa Rosa in the central-eastern area. A police career
                     system was established requiring members to fulfill training to advance to higher
                     positions. The PNC’s budget also grew in real terms [<a href="#R64">64</a>]. The rate of police people per 10,000 inhabitants increased dramatically to 22.36
                     in 2018. By 2020 the PNC had grown to 40,693 operational elements (15.6% of which
                     were women) supported by an administrative staff of 569 (59% women) [<a href="#R65">65</a>].
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e487">Efforts to strengthen capacities in matters of violence and crime prevention have
                     also taken place. A Sub-directorate General for Crime Prevention was formed in the
                     2000s with departments specialized in working with children, women, multicultural
                     issues and fostering community relations. Programs have included door-to-door visits
                     to neighbors, presentations in schools, work with traditional authorities, support
                     to local citizens’ committees, and a ‘‘safe schools’’ program that kept educational
                     premises open after-hours and during weekends providing educational and recreational
                     activities for young people [<a href="#R66">66</a>].
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e492">An institutional policy for community policing was not, however, adopted until the
                     launch of the Integral Community Security Police Model (MOPSIC) in 2014 [<a href="#R59">59</a>]. MOPSIC is a model founded on the assignment of clear responsibilities to police
                     officers in charge of stations or sub-stations for crime indicators in their demarcations.
                     Under MOPSIC a special unit was set up to train sub-station personnel using a guiding
                     manual. Locally deployed policemen are expected to make use not only of techniques
                     for criminal investigation, analysis, and direct control of crime, but to implement
                     a sustained effort to approach their communities to prevent criminal activities, nurture
                     trust and collaboration with the population- and in this way prevent violence.
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e497">The MOPSIC model is part of the PNC’s Strategic Plan 2014-2020 and its principles
                     have been adopted as the guiding standard for police work in Guatemala. Decree 48-2014
                     reorganized stations and substations to respond to the model deploying specialized
                     agents and officers to each as part of ‘‘facilitator teams’’. Officially all units
                     throughout the country have received MOPSIC training since 2014.
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e499">The MOPSIC manual provides guidance for police stations to carry out work in specific
                     sectors of their assigned district [<a href="#R59">59</a>]. An Integral Format of Police Activities (FIAPOL) sheet is used to plan activities
                     and set up times of turns and work periods. A Statistical Analysis Format (FAES) is
                     used to summarize and determine the security situation in a particular territory.
                     Each of the 130 stations have at least a pair of analysts that compile and verify
                     information. With this information they formulate a diagnostic of the security situation
                     and plan responses according to the crime level and resources at hand. The strategy
                     chosen may then be preventive, reactive, or investigative in character. The PNC’s
                     Directorate of Community Relations (DIRC), part of the Sub-Directorate General for
                     Crime Prevention (SDGPD), played a key role in the outset of MOPSIC’s implementation.
                     In each station DIRC personnel have provided support in training and deployed personnel
                     to fulfill MOPSIC processes. Since 2017 the much larger Sub-Directorate General for
                     Operations of the PNC has also become more actively engaged in the implementation
                     of MOPSIC and the take-up of responsibility for it in different districts.
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e504">The development of MOPSIC has received support from the Bureau of International Narcotics
                     and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL), part of the U.S. Department of State and the main
                     donor to Guatemala in matters of security. Other international donors include the
                     United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the German Federal Enterprise
                     for International Cooperation (GIZ), and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP).
                     The Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA) has provided continuous technical
                     support to the development of COP in Guatemala.
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e506">Our research conducted in Villa Canales and Totonicapán show that community engagement
                     by the police has met with positive reactions from residents [<a href="#R59">59</a>]. However, not all police agents have been trained to implement the model. In areas
                     of high criminality there are not enough police officers to patrol the territory.
                     Our research was not able to find examples of the use of problem-solving methods,
                     which probably requires more police training and better analytical capabilities.
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e511">Despite the difficulties faced by COP, there is a gradual movement towards reform
                     as a new generation of police officers is taking over. Even if trust from the community
                     towards the police in rural areas remains low, the development of the MOPSIC model
                     has started to create more empathy and social cooperation. Clear challenges to this
                     reform process remain. This is particularly evident when the police are compelled
                     by the government and business elites to clamp down on free expression and social
                     protest. Powerful economic actors and politicians have demanded repressive action
                     by the police in response to the protests organized by communities affected by resource
                     extraction and energy and infrastructure projects. When badly managed land, water
                     and energy projects escalate, the police have been required to evict peasant farmers
                     and indigenous communities from privately titled holdings of agroindustry, or to remove
                     blockades formed by protests opposing the diversion of rivers for hydro-electric schemes
                     [<a href="#R67">67</a>].

                  <p id="d1e517">In recent years, the police have failed in its responsibility mainly because of its

                     and the national media due to the violent eviction of 40 families of former employees
                     of the Dieseldorff company from their homes. The landowners allege that the land had
                     been illegally occupied and denied responsibility for the burning of the houses. The
                     police were accused by the local peasant organizations for not having attended their

                     campaign of President Jimmy Morales. Following a review of its mandate, the Guatemalan
                     government announced that it was withdrawing from the UN-backed anti-corruption commission,

                  <p id="d1e557">The case of Nicaraguan policing is different to the others previously described. First,
                     the national police force was not created because of the terms and conclusions of
                     a peace accord and return of democracy. Previous studies of Nicaraguan policing also
                     commonly connect the <i>communitarian</i> origins of the police force with the Sandinista Revolution (1978-1990)[<a href="#R30">30</a>]. Existing studies also recognize that the shape and practice of the Nicaraguan COP
                     model is the result of several generations of change and reform [<a href="#R71">71</a>].
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e568">The defeat of the Anastasio Somoza dictatorship marked the end of the Nicaraguan National
                     Guard, and their substitution by the Sandinista Popular Army and the Sandinista Police.
                     The Sandinista Police were founded on the 5th of September 1979. With its establishment,
                     the new government aimed to end the history of open repression carried out by the
                     earlier National Guard. From 1979 onwards, the Sandinista government decided to separate
                     the functions of defense and security from that of law enforcement. This resulted
                     in the creation of the Ministry of Defense and the Sandinista Popular Army, and the
                     Ministry of the Interior and the Sandinista Police. The New Sandinista Police force
                     initially counted on the advice and training of Panama, but its equipment and professional
                     training drew mostly on socialist policy (and particularly East Germany and the example
                     of Cuba). From 1979 to 1989, the police force was formally tasked ‘‘to guarantee the
                     status quo and property with revolutionary sentiment, confront crime and assist the
                     task of securing the state’’ [<a href="#R72">72</a>].
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e573">Throughout the 1980s the police formed part of the broad defense of the revolution
                     in which they were assigned the task of preventing crime and counter-revolutionary
                     activities [<a href="#R73">73</a>]. However, the government also created the General Direction of State Security which
                     was independent from the police and carried out intelligence and counterintelligence
                     activities on a more permanent basis [<a href="#R74">74</a>].
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e581">The new police implemented their tasks with a strong emphasis on participation from
                     the public. In response to the drastic economic measures adopted by the Nicaraguan
                     government at the end of the 1980s and with the aim of counteracting the legacy of
                     war, the Sandinista Police started a process of experimentation in which a significant
                     reduction was made of its technical, human, and material capacities. Significant cuts
                     were made to the budgets of all parts of the state apparatus. At the same time there
                     was an increase in the level of crime. This in turn influenced the capacity and attitude
                     of the police force to exercise the functions with which it had been entrusted.
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e583">With limited resources and personnel, the Nicaraguan National Police (PNN) was forced
                     to decentralize its responses to crime and manifestations of insecurity [<a href="#R73">73</a>]. It did this by establishing broad and permanent channels of communication with
                     community organizations, both through the formation of community-assemblies and maintaining
                     direct links with residents, who supported the Sandinistas. In the 1980s, the Nicaraguan
                     police introduced two important elements of their current COP model i.e., committees
                     for the defense of the revolution (<i>Comites por la defensa de la revolución</i>—later to become Committees for Citizen Power-CPCs) and <i>jefes de sector</i> (heads of sector). Whereas the committees would become a key point of articulation
                     between the police and the families, the heads of sector would become members of the
                     police in charge of maintaining links and responding to security needs from the neighborhoods
                     [<a href="#R73">73</a>].
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e597">In 1989, the police force’s position in relation to the Ministry of the Interior was
                     ratified by Law No.65 ‘‘Law of the Functions of the Sandinista Police’’ in which it
                     was defined as an ‘‘organ of the Ministry of the Interior’’ [<a href="#R73">73</a>]. In contrast to its earlier formal remit to defend the state and popular revolution,
                     the police were now tasked with the protection of the life and physical integrity
                     of the country’s civilian inhabitants. They therefore assumed responsibility for the
                     prevention of crime and preservation of public order.
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e602">During the 1980s a coalition of several rebel groups combined to become the Nicaraguan
                     resistance (<i>Contras</i>). They carried out attacks against government officials and blew up strategic bridges
                     with substantial funding and support from the US. To gain national and international
                     legitimacy the Sandinista government called for presidential elections in 1990, which
                     were won by the liberal Violeta Chamorro (1990-1997).
                     
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e607">The new government was faced on the one hand with economic pressures from the US to
                     reduce Sandinista influence in the security apparatus, but on the other it was forced
                     to recognize the considerable popular strength of the Sandinistas and their control
                     over the armed forces and the police. This led to negotiations between the government
                     and the Sandinistas that the police structure would remain in place, but new rules
                     would be established ensuring the independence of the police from the Sandinista party
                     [<a href="#R5">5</a>]. The police leadership decided that it had to institutionalize itself and remain
                     professional and non-partisan.
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e612">The Chamorro government rejected the socialist premise of the earlier government and
                     of its efforts to organize the masses. The National Police now implemented the concept
                     of public security as its principal doctrine and adopted the conception and philosophy
                     of public service and prevention. As such the new model was as one informant put it
                     ‘‘aimed at 1. De-politicizing the national police and 2. removing party-based alliances’’.
                     The Organic Law of the National Police (1992) established the national police public
                     civilian organization founded on professional criteria including political impartiality.
                     In addition, the Police based their legal foundation on a newly reformed political
                     constitution: ‘‘The National Police is an armed body of civil nature. It has as its
                     mission the guarantee of internal order, the security of the citizenry, the prevention
                     and prosecution of crime and other activities specified by law’’ [<a href="#R75">75</a>].

                  <p id="d1e620">In the process of modernization and de-politicization the police improved its recruitment
                     and training systems. At the same time, it refocused its communitarian strategy with
                     support from European donors in a completely new political and social context. The
                     police established contacts with civil society organizations, NGOs and on occasion
                     with remnant elements of the Sandinista guilds. The aim of these kinds of contacts
                     also changed, becoming focused on the prevention of gender violence, youth crime and
                     a coordinated response to problems confronted by the community.
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e622">The National Police proposed the institutionalization of the issue of gender in the
                     institutions policies and practices [<a href="#R73">73</a>]. Particular attention was given to the intra- family and sexual violence. This process
                     culminated in the creation of the <i>Mother and Child Stations</i>. These stations were born out of a joint initiative between the civil society and
                     the National Police, as spaces that provide integrated attention to the victims and
                     survivors of intra-family and sexual violence.
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e630">The process of professionalization of the national police in the 1990s also included
                     the introduction of a programme aimed at the prevention of adolescent crime. In 1995
                     the national police introduced a strategy targeting adolescent crime and related gang
                     violence. In contrast to other Central American countries, adolescent crime was recognized
                     not only an issue of public order, but as a social problem. The programme aimed to
                     address the issue of adolescent crime not by force, but through a system of youth
                     education and promotion. The police established several Centres of Youth Formation
                     and Development (<i>Centros de Formación y Desarrollo Juvenil</i>) where adolescents identified by their families and the police were encouraged to
                     enter vocational training programmes and a system of follow up and supervision by
                     designated police officers.
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e635">These developments lead up to the formal introduction of the Preventative Community
                     Policing model. On the 20th of November 2001, following Decree No 0426-2001, the Director
                     General of the National Police the then Director General of the National Police, First
                     Commander Edwin Cordero Ardila established the Integrated Police- Community Policy.
                     This policy was conceived of as an instrument permitting the promotion of a change
                     of attitude amongst members of the Police, and the facilitation of direct relations
                     between the police and the community to achieve its institutional mission with increased
                     efficiency and efficacy [<a href="#R73">73</a>]. The central goal of the model was the operationalization, mainstreaming and integration
                     of COP as a joint action in all areas of specialization within the national police.
                     It has its formal expression in the operative plans implemented at the level of sector,
                     municipality, delegation and police district, and national level. The stated aim of
                     this policy is to contribute to the improvements of the quality of life of the population,
                     and particularly with regards to citizens’ security, guaranteeing the relationship
                     between the institution of the police with the communities, putting in place preventative
                     work and activities aimed at optimizing the quality of police services [<a href="#R73">73</a>].
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e643">The main features of the policy were based on the reinforcement of social relations
                     between the national police and different social groups in the community: the prevention
                     of crime at the level of the community; a focus on gender and prevention amongst children
                     and youths; respecting human rights and constitutional guarantees for individuals
                     under police custody and their families [<a href="#R76">76</a>].
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e648">Three central aspects differentiate the community policing model in Nicaragua from
                     others. First, the authorized protagonist role of collective actors such as the Committees
                     for the Social Prevention of Crime (<i>Comités de Prevención Social del Delito</i>) created by a resolution of the Director General of the National Police as ‘‘spaces
                     for proactive citizen participation’’ [<a href="#R77">77</a>]. Their mandate is specified in the Plan for the Implementation of Integral Police-Community
                     Human Rights as organizing community assemblies, identifying local problems, and obtaining
                     resources to solve them [<a href="#R78">78</a>]. A second aspect is undoubtedly the role carried out by the jefe de sector (sector
                     leader), whose role it is to respond to the community and to consider the linkages
                     between policing and social challenges. This leads us to a third aspect- undoubtedly
                     an inheritance of a revolutionary past-, the police are to understand that crime prevention
                     is also reliant on actions of social development. An example of this is the activities
                     of the Directorate for Youth Issues of the National Police (<i>Dirección de Asuntos Juveniles de la Policía Nacional</i>). The Directorate carries out interventions in psycho-social issues with youths at
                     risk of being integrated into organized crime.
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e662">Until recently there was broad agreement that the Nicaraguan police were considerably
                     less repressive that other police forces in the region. It is however also recognizes
                     that in recent years violence against youths has been routine [<a href="#R79">79</a>]. Despite this, the Nicaraguan police have historically been recognized for their
                     greater willingness to change and reform leadership structures and crime prevention
                     strategies [<a href="#R13">13</a>].
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e670">The real value of the <i>jefes de sector</i> is less clear. Their work and presence are different from sector to sector, place
                     to place. This in part reflects that they have not received specific higher-level
                     education and training. There are also no sets standards. This has problematic results.
                     According to a survey carried out by the Institute for Strategic Study and Public
                     Politics (IEEEPP), only 21.8% of citizens know who the <i>jefe de sector</i> is in their neighborhood or community.

                     elected President. He gradually took control of the other branches of government,
                     and through a decision of the Supreme Court was allowed to run for office again in
                     2011. In January 2014 the National Assembly, dominated by the FSLN, approved constitutional
                     amendments that abolished term limits for the presidency and allowed a president to
                     run for an unlimited number of five-year terms.
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e683">Under Ortega the police became increasingly politicized and repressive. In 2015 the
                     Nicaraguan government approved the establishment of the Sovereign Security Act. The
                     Act’s stated objective was to ‘‘preserve, promote, and maintain sovereign security’’
                     against threats that include transnational organized crime, international terrorism,
                     foreign interference, criminality, rebellion, illicit acts against aviation and maritime
                     navigation, attacks against cyber security and infrastructure, or ‘‘any illegal act
                     that threatens the existence of the Nicaraguan state and its institutions.’’ In the
                     years that followed the reform, the police’s use of force to stop and break up protests
                     the government were characterized by government communications as necessary in the
                     interest of public security and national strategic interest.
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e685">In 2017 the security analyst Roberto Cajines suggested in a blog post that the hard-handed
                     actions of the police against protesters represented ‘‘the profound systematic crisis
                     in which the Police finds itself, in which the police are now denaturalized and converted
                     into a body at the service of a dynastic project and the continuance of Daniel Ortega’’
                     [<a href="#R80">80</a>]. Further signs that democratic conditions were worsening included the way in which
                     the government has used to the judicial system to ban most of the political opposition
                     in the run up to elections in November 2016 [<a href="#R81">81</a>]. Days later Ortega also positioned his wife, Rosario Murillo, as the candidate for
                     the vice-presidency. The revival of the strongman role is interpreted by some analysts
                     as reflecting an authoritarian turn, and the complete return of the political tradition
                     for <i>caudillismo</i> in Nicaragua after an interlude of democracy lasting from the Revolution to the return
                     of Ortega in 2008.
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e696">Following success in the 2016 elections, the new government carried out a series of
                     changes to the set-up of the police and the security forces. Changes were made to
                     the operation of COP, including the transference of responsibility for programs aimed
                     at youth, community sports, mothers, and children and at combatting domestic violence
                     to other government institutions. This has changed the quality of police-community
                     relations. Whilst from the outside these programs appeared to be beyond the bounds
                     of the public security mandate of the police, they are acknowledged by national analysts
                     as having enabled both a close and effective relationship between the community and
                     the police. The recent removal of responsibility for these programs (the <i>Centros de Juventud</i> remain under police jurisdiction) whilst given explanation in terms of increasing
                     institutional efficiency, is interpreted at least by some commentators as a politically
                     motivated strategy by the Presidency to co-opt the popular support surrounding these
                     programs.
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e701">The national administration also notably made a shift at this time towards more heavy-handed
                     tactics to make up for low police numbers and poor coverage. In rural areas the military
                     have always had a role in the provision of security and taken a particular role in
                     combatting the transportation of narcotics along the Nicaraguan Atlantic coast. There
                     has now been a hightened presence of specially trained police units in Managua and
                     Bluefields. In the case of Managua this was officially characterized as a response
                     to the rise in violent crimes in the city. The police put into place the ‘‘Plan for
                     the Strengthening of Security in the City of Managua’’ which according to official
                     information is led by the <i>Directorate of Special Police Operations</i> (DOEP). Law 872 of the National Police Law establishes that the DOEP is a specialized
                     department of the Police that ‘‘corresponds with the intervention to restore public
                     order in serious altercations, to participate in special operations against drug trafficking,
                     terrorism, organized crime and other serious crimes’’. This is first time that the
                     DOEP had been tasked with the response to everyday crimes. It also involves the expanded
                     use of the black uniformed and heavily armed <i>Dantos Brigade</i> in patrols and responses to reported violent crime in public spaces. According to
                     Roberto Cajina this is a sign that ‘‘the Police have lost their capacity to prevent
                     and to be proactive, that they have lost their capacity to anticipate actions and
                     guarantee the security of the population’’ …it is ‘‘the unfolding of the police special
                     forces in the application of a ‘‘heavy hand’’ policy in response to common crime’’
                     [<a href="#R80">80</a>]. Events in 2018 sadly unfolded to corroborate these claims.
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e712">A series of protest were sparked in April 2018 following the decision by the Nicaraguan
                     government to introduce cuts to pensions that would increase workers contributions
                     and reduce overall benefits. Although the government would cancel the welfare reform
                     in response to the initial unrest, protest nonetheless spread largely because of the
                     heavy-handed police response and government administrations claims that protest was
                     the result of political manipulation by opposition groups [<a href="#R82">82</a>]. On the Atlantic Coast anger also boiled over into violent protest due to the perceived
                     failure of police and governmental response to wildfires in the Indio Maíz biosphere
                     [<a href="#R83">83</a>]. Media coverage highlighted the presence of the black uniforms of the Dantos Brigade
                     at the center of the violence both in the initial protests and multiple confrontations
                     that would take place in Managua, Masaya and Bluefields in following weeks and months
                     [<a href="#R84">84</a>]. International and national media coverage has also emphasized the apparent alliance
                     between the unit and balaclava clad para-police groups otherwise in civilian clothing.
                     Media articles suggest that these para- police groups are civilian volunteers from
                     the Sandinista FSLN party [<a href="#R85">85</a>].
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e726">It is these groups that are together attributed with the killing of hundreds of civilians
                     and continuing threats made to community and opposition activists [<a href="#R86">86</a>]. From 2018 to present multiple international news articles and reports detail the
                     involvement of these joint forces in the arbitrary detention and physical abuse of
                     student protesters [<a href="#R87">87</a>, <a href="#R88">88</a>]. Key think-tanks critical to the Ortega government, including the Institute for
                     Strategic Study and Public Policy (IEEP)- our academic partner institution in Nicaragua-
                     have had their legal status revoked by the government.

            <p id="d1e740">Our review of the implementation of community policing programmes in three Central
               American countries reveals the significance of their foundations. We highlight the
               lasting problem of the integration of individuals allied with earlier authoritarian
               government institutions. This is particularly evident in the case of Guatemala, where
               the influence of civilians and military personnel with this history in the Ministry
               of Government (Ministerio de Gobernación) resulted in the formation of a police force
               weakened by connections to corruption and organized crime [<a href="#R5">5</a>]. In El Salvador where the effort to construct a new police force has largely been
               considered more successful, the ARENA governments worked to integrate members of the
               previous military regime in clear opposition of the philosophy and stated intentions
               of the Peace Accords. Under these conditions the democratic character of the police
               has been permanently affected and their participation in waves of repressive actions
               against the gangs has eroded public trust and confidence. As a result, two decades
               after the transition to democracy, c. 20% of the citizenry indicate that they do not
               depend on the police for their security. This implies that in key areas of the country
               there are hybrid systems of security in which citizens themselves intervene or where
               private security companies and criminal organisations are in control. All of which
               do not respond to democratic norms of the rule of law [<a href="#R5">5</a>, <a href="#R89">89</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e751">This reality places in doubt one of the substantial claims of the literature with
               regards to the importance of the police for the consolidation of trust in the Salvadorean
               and Guatemalan states. Goldsmith argues that trust in policing cannot be examined
               separately from trust in government [<a href="#R31">31</a>]. Other authors argue that the actions of the police symbolize the State and therefore
               the legitimacy of the police is vital in terms of convincing citizens to obey the
               law [<a href="#R90">90</a>]. The invisibility of the police to significant parts of the population in El Salvador
               and probably Guatemala limits this argument. This is especially the case given that
               this invisibility is not a matter of a lack of resources, but rather the outcome of
               decisions by powerful actors in government and policing institutions.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e759">Whilst sweeping changes were made to Latin American public institutions, democratic
               practice, and law during the 1990s and 2000s, throughout this period it has also been
               evident that the region’s earlier history of military dictatorship, class division
               and armed conflict has cast long shadows into the present. Peace in the region of
               Central America was to be secured through the combination of democratic institutions,
               the strengthening of civil society, and a set of neoliberal reforms aimed at unleashing
               the potential of the local private sectors and foreign investment required for growth
               [<a href="#R91">91</a>]. This combination of political liberal democracy and economic neoliberalism was
               supported by donors through a variety of assistance programs that led to specific
               adjustments. However, the co-existence of electoral democracy with violent practices
               sponsored by the State and a weak state of rule of law has generated a political context
               that struggles to remain democratic, and clearly affects the efforts to reform the
               police [<a href="#R10">10</a>]. Global diffusion and local ‘‘editing’’ [<a href="#R10">10</a>] or ‘‘translation and adaptation’’ of COP programs intermesh to generate policy outcomes
               that may adhere to the original model in some ways, but diverge from, or even oppose
               its precepts, in others [<a href="#R24">24</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e773">The implementation of community policing in Guatemala and El Salvador was further
               compromised by the weak capacity of their police forces to control rising homicidal
               rates. Based on the argument that crime was at a level beyond the police capacity,
               several governments reintroduced the military in public security operations.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e775">Our research in two distinct communities in Guatemala clearly evidences the need to
               pay attention to the context into which COP programmes are introduced. In Totonicapán
               formal policing is secondary to the policing that the community carries out itself,
               and trust in the police is based on an understanding that they do not interfere in
               the norms and customs of the local population. In contrast, in Villa Canales the population
               are overwhelmed by risks and insecurities that the community itself cannot control
               on its own. The population there appreciate the increasing level of police effectiveness
               but understand the scarcity of resources that affects police operations in their community.
               
            </p>
            <p id="d1e777">The situation in Nicaragua represents a partial contrast to that which has occurred
               in Guatemala and El Salvador. Elections in the 1990s obliged the Sandinistas to accept
               reform leading to a delinking of the police from politics. This contributed to the
               rule of law in the country. Two factors facilitated this transition. The first was
               that the levels of violence and crime in the country was a lot lower than in neighboring
               countries, to a significant degree assisted by the removal of groups allied with the
               Somoza dictatorship. The second, was the formation of a model in which the police
               operated in alliance with civil society organizations with origins in Sandinismo.
               These unique factors explain the consolidation of a foundation of trust and confidence
               not found elsewhere in the region.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e779">In the cases of El Salvador and Guatemala the efforts to support COP programmes initially
               corresponded with the initiatives of international donor institutions. This was strongly
               exemplified by the support granted to these efforts by multilateral and bilateral
               institutions such as the Inter-American Development Bank, GIZ, JICA, Norad and the
               European Union. These institutions viewed COP as an appropriate path towards a more
               democratic form of policing. In an era of democracy accompanied by ever-rising rates
               of crime and violence COP was seen as a method to reform policing, but also to sell
               policing to the public [<a href="#R10">10</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e784">Before 2014 there was no solid institutional support to the police in either Guatemala
               or El Salvador. However, there were some pilot projects for community policing, and
               support for a focus on the issue of gender [<a href="#R14">14</a>]. An aspect that has received little attention is that community policing programmes
               emerged without significant reform of institutional contexts. The creation of the
               Vice Ministry of Communal Affairs in Guatemala was aimed at creating crime prevention
               by funding security committees at the municipal level. The <i>Juntas Locales de Seguridad</i> (Local Security Committees) created in 1999 took place, however, on the foundations
               of self-defence committees (autodefensas) that had been founded during the armed conflict.
               These committees had been accused of episodes of extra-legal violence and hangings.
               Argueta [<a href="#R57">57</a>] characterizes this process as one of layering, in which the institutional norms
               that encourage community participation end up reinforcing mechanisms that are anti-democratic.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e795">In the case of Nicaragua, the characteristics of a communitarian police were formed
               on the foundations of social organization introduced during the Sandinista Revolution.
               Two important characteristics we have highlighted earlier is the emphasis given to
               collective organizations in the relationship between police and community, rather
               than to individuals or neighbors. The police’s participation in social prevention
               programmes is also notable given that it surpasses similar characteristics of policing
               studied in other countries. Through these structures the national police were able
               to not only generate a strong contact with the local community but ensure the rapid
               exchange of information regarding crime and local development concerns. They also
               enabled the police to proactively identify threats at an earlier stage and efficiently
               intervene to prevent and remove these risks. Changing circumstances, however, make
               claims that the Nicaraguan COP model represents an example of good practice in public
               security increasingly untenable.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e797">As a result of the institutional changes made by the Nicaraguan government, the police
               now have a permanent first commissioner and many of its social programmes with women
               and youths removed from their control. Whilst the government argues for this in terms
               of bureaucratic efficiency, the removal of these responsibilities from the police
               has also removed vital points of communication with the community. The key institutional
               mechanisms mentioned above continue to function, but increasing critique is made of
               the way in which the Ortega government’s particular brand of ideology i.e., Sandinismo
               mixed with conservative Catholicism, has intervened in their operation. Party alliance
               appears to be proactively replacing democratic communitarianism as the defining characteristic
               of who receives attention from these instances. Indeed, it appears that issue of political
               alliances is at least a feature of the growing inability of the national police to
               respond to the growing levels of violence and insecurity developing in the Atlantic
               Autonomous Regions. In this context the police not only appear partisan but are also
               failing to actively prevent rising tensions and further conflict. The extraordinary
               violence and public unrest of recent years demonstrate that trust between the police
               and community, and the government and community are no longer what they once were.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e800">In our research we have emphasized that COP is a trust building strategy. However,
               in studying these three contexts we think it worthwhile to explore the possibility
               of a more anthropological orientation in understanding trust and policing. We note
               in line with Broch-Due &amp; Ystanes [<a href="#R92">92</a>] that there is a common tendency to assume that trust is essentially the same everywhere.
               Borrowing from the work of Broch-Due &amp; Ystanes we echo their argument that trust is
               a composite social phenomenon formed in complex social landscapes, each with their
               own histories [<a href="#R92">92</a>]. The shared social spaces that trust builds are of different scales, complexity
               and duration depending on the specific geographical, cultural, and historical location.
               Trusting is built over time and always vulnerable to the countervailing forces of
               mistrust, which can overwhelm some social spaces and biographies [<a href="#R92">92</a>]. In other words, local settings that reflect concentrations of ethnic population
               or social disadvantage often provide distinct experiences and socialization processes
               for residents that impact negatively upon public perceptions of public services including
               the police [<a href="#R93">93</a>, <a href="#R94">94</a>, <a href="#R95">95</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e821">COP was exported to many countries in the context of a return to civilian rule. COP
               plus a better police service were supposed to facilitate a transition to democratic
               policing. However, in an authoritarian context COP has served the interests of authoritarian
               government. As a result of persisting authoritarian politics and social dynamics,
               a breakdown in state-community relations is occurring in all three countries- albeit
               with somewhat distinct features and gravity. Significant features of this breakdown
               are not only new articulations of civil and political violence, but a major reversal
               of the broad agreement on human security- concerned not only with public order, but
               well-being- that had started to take root with the establishment of community-oriented
               policing in the region.
