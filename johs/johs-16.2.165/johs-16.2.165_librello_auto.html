                                 Policing (COP) in Central America (Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua). We emphasize
                                 in particular the formal role of COP as a means to re-establish trust between the
                                 state and community, demonstrate professionalism and to evidence the democratic accountability
                                 of the police to the population. Although these formal goals remain the goal of community
                                 oriented policing, we demonstrate in this article that there has been an increased
                                 emphasis on more kinetic or militarized forms of policing in recent years. Hard handed,
                                 heavily armed and interventionist police policies have spread from El Salvador to
                                 Guatemala, and more recently Nicaragua. Moves towards more aggressive policing are
                                 explained by governments and police forces as a necessary response to the rising threat
                                 of gangs and drug cartels and horrifying levels of homicide statistics. However, as
                                 we highlight there is also evidence of these changes reflecting undemocratic shifts
                                 within national administrations and the repositioning of people within government
                                 and national institutions with links to these countries' earlier military governments.The
                                 net effect of these changes we argue is to erode the intentions of COP initiatives,
                                 and severely reduce levels of trust and accountability between people and the democratic
                                 state.</span></div>

                              <p id="d1e118">With the end of civil war and armed conflicts in Central America a new period of civilian
                                 and democratically elected government started in the 1990s. Elected governments were
                                 quick to announce that a new era of peace, security and economic growth had arrived.
                                 To ensure this new era, multiple reforms were made to secure the dissolution of the
                                 pre-existing security and law enforcement forces and their replacement by new civilian
                                 police institutions.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e120">In the years that followed, academics, international development organizations and
                                 some social leaders promoted community policing as synonymous with democracy given
                                 its emphasis on the construction of cooperative relations with the community, the
                                 prevention of crime and respect to human rights [<a href="#R1">1</a>]. The continuing efforts to introduce this kind of policing can also be interpreted
                                 as an effort to gain the trust of the public in the police, with basis in the idea
                                 that community policing constituted an effective manner to provide service to the
                                 public. The projects for community policing would develop with different characteristics
                                 and longevity, something that inspired critique from authors who questioned its long-term
                                 impact [<a href="#R2">2</a>]. As with other efforts to create institutional trust in the police, projects for
                                 community policing were developed through complex institutional systems, in which
                                 other actors and factors intervened other than just the police and public [<a href="#R3">3</a>]. Of these factors the most salient was the institutional persistence in the police
                                 forces of actors associated with previous authoritarian military regimes. This contributed
                                 to continued violence and would create an obstacle for the transformation of the police
                                 [<a href="#R4">4</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e134">Community policing (COP) constitutes a model for policing derived from a particular
                                 economic, social, and political context i.e., liberal democratic political systems.
                                 The literature written on the practice of the model takes for granted that there is
                                 a stable political context, and high levels of social cohesion [<a href="#R5">5</a>, <a href="#R6">6</a>]. It has been assumed that any resistance to the model will be produced internally
                                 within policing institutions themselves [<a href="#R7">7</a>, <a href="#R8">8</a>, <a href="#R9">9</a>, <a href="#R10">10</a>]. Acknowledging this, the comparative study of community policing in the country
                                 cases of Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Guatemala we will carry out in this article provides
                                 an important addition. In contrast to earlier writing, the context of a post-conflict
                                 era is seen to mould the results of attempts to reform policing. The structure of
                                 political power in each case explains the characteristics that the police acquire
                                 in Nicaragua, their marginalization from power in Guatemala and the co-existence of
                                 contradictory forces of community policing and the militarization of law enforcement
                                 in the context of El Salvador.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e155">In this article we discuss the comparative characteristics of police trust building
                                 efforts in three countries. All the countries have significant histories of armed
                                 conflict, and they all revamped their systems of security following the formal return
                                 of peace. In each context there has also been important support to the design and
                                 training for community policing. This has been given to the police and national police
                                 forces by international organizations and law enforcement specialists. Until recently,
                                 the international community praised the police command in these three countries for
                                 leading the way in developing systems for COP.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e157">In this article we argue and evidence through our focus on COP that although the period
                                 following armed conflict was one of democratic experimentation the results of this
                                 have ultimately been weak transitions. Indeed, in Guatemala and El Salvador the concept
                                 of ‘‘violent democracies’’ has been applied [<a href="#R11">11</a>] recognizing evidence of elevated levels of state violence and continuance in positions
                                 of power by members of the military and civilians that had been key actors in earlier
                                 dictatorial governments. Nicaragua has also lost its democratic direction in recent
                                 years with clear signs of presidential authoritarianism. These features explain why
                                 much of the international praise and support for COP strategies has now come to an
                                 end. Although COP models remain in action there has been an increased emphasis on
                                 militarized forms of policing in all three countries in recent years.

                              <p id="d1e180">Community policing (COP) is a strategy developed and adopted with the specific goal
                                 of improving conditions of trust between the police and public. Its modern roots lie
                                 in the United States in the 1970s [<a href="#R10">10</a>, <a href="#R15">15</a>, <a href="#R16">16</a>], from where it spread into Canada and Europe, and on into Latin America, Africa,
                                 and Asia. Although Bayley [<a href="#R17">17</a>] argues that there is no agreed definition of COP there appear to be similar conditions
                                 [<a href="#R18">18</a>] for its testing and implementation i.e., it is a clear effort to respond to a lack
                                 of public confidence in the police. COP places an emphasis on the preventative role
                                 of the police in a closely defined geographic area i.e., the neighborhood. A second
                                 condition of the model is the promotion of close relations with the community with
                                 the goal of creating the basis for a continuous dynamic of consultation with local
                                 citizens, and responsiveness to local perceptions and priorities [<a href="#R19">19</a>]. This forms the basis of a focused strategy in which the police study the conditions
                                 of delinquency and crime at the local level, revises its priorities in response to
                                 the fears of the local community, and implements the resolution of both crime and
                                 broader social challenges with the neighborhood [<a href="#R20">20</a>] reducing levels of crime and related fears [<a href="#R21">21</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e207">Key sources on COP have focused on its impact, concluding that there is significant
                                 evidence that this strategy for policing improves local citizens perceptions of the
                                 police, their approval of their activities, their legitimacy as a state institution,
                                 but it has some limited impact on the levels of crime and related fears [<a href="#R22">22</a>]. In Latin America there are studies which focus on conditions for COP success [<a href="#R23">23</a>], as well as on problems of implementation [<a href="#R10">10</a>, <a href="#R24">24</a>, <a href="#R25">25</a>, <a href="#R26">26</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e228">Our approach is different, given that we have chosen to study COP acknowledging the
                                 significance of the political and social context in which it has been implemented.
                                 In this sense, we do not look to explain the strengths and weaknesses of the model
                                 of policing, but rather the processes that explain its eventual character in the three
                                 countries under study. In this respect, we argue that it is only with careful contextual
                                 analysis of the political and social context that we can fully understand COP’s implementation
                                 in each case, the reasons for their survival in parallel to increased militarization
                                 and their possible impact on the public confidence in the police. The histories of
                                 conflict and post-conflict in each of the countries under study are important points
                                 of entry to understand the background of community-oriented policing in each case,
                                 as part of trust building strategies.

                              <p id="d1e230">Efforts to reform the police forces in Latin America multiplied throughout the region
                                 in the 1990s to separate police from the military, improve professional standards,
                                 curb police abuses, and improve police-community relations. The signing of the peace
                                 accords between the governments and armed opposition groups in El Salvador in 1992
                                 and Guatemala in 1996 was particularly significant to police reform in the region.
                                 In both cases, the peace accords stipulated the creation of new civilian police forces
                                 to replace the former police bodies that were subordinated to the armed forces. Police
                                 reformers comprised human rights activists, bilateral and multilateral international
                                 organizations, academics, and some government officials [<a href="#R27">27</a>, <a href="#R28">28</a>, <a href="#R29">29</a>]. Twenty years later, academic analysis that takes stock of the process considers
                                 its results disappointing [<a href="#R30">30</a>].

                                    <p id="d1e247">Trust as a concept plays an important role in police reform because a deficit of trust
                                       in both government and the police are all too common in post-conflict societies [<a href="#R31">31</a>]. Goldsmith argues that the reform of the police in post-conflict contexts requires
                                       substantive attention to the improvement of trust in the police and forces of law
                                       and order. In contexts in which trust in the police is absent, he observes that it
                                       has been impossible for the police to gain the legitimacy and consent from the public
                                       needed to effectively carry out their duties. The perception of the public with respect
                                       to the police has consequence in terms of a contribution to the nature of the relationship
                                       between society and the state. Police presence is a representation of the existence
                                       of the state in a location, and for that reason the public impression of their actions
                                       has impact on the citizens trust and understanding of the state. In a democratic society
                                       the legitimacy of the police and other public institutions act to reinforce the conformity
                                       of citizens to the laws and norms that are represented by the police [<a href="#R32">32</a>].
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e255">Belief that COP will improve relations between the citizenry and the police, and the
                                       effectiveness of policing has significance for understanding the consolidation of
                                       democratic states in Central America. Several studies carried out in developed liberal
                                       democracies conclude that trust depends on the perception of how justice is practiced
                                       in citizens’ encounters with the police [<a href="#R33">33</a>, <a href="#R34">34</a>]. In the context of Latin America, Malone &amp; Dammert [<a href="#R35">35</a>] suggest that confidence in the police depends equally on the perception of the police
                                       community relations, as it does on effectiveness and measurable results.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e266">The increase in violent crime can be interpreted to be a result of ineffective policing
                                       and generate pressure for military personnel being assigned tasks in public security.
                                       This is highly probable in countries that have an historical tradition for the participation
                                       of the armed forces in the control of the citizenry and where they are recognized
                                       as a force that can be actively used where the police are unable [<a href="#R12">12</a>]. Another effect of deficient policing is an increase in mistrust in the rule of
                                       law and tendency towards increasing acts of vigilantism [<a href="#R36">36</a>, <a href="#R37">37</a>].
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e277">The efforts to implement community policing we describe here can only be discerned
                                       within a theoretical frame of understanding in which the state is interpreted to be
                                       a fundamental actor in the definition of politics but composed of diverse organizations
                                       that may not have a singular or coherent interests and loyalties. It is only within
                                       this frame that sense can be made of the co-existence of COP programmes and authoritarian
                                       policing resulting in serious violations of human rights. At the same time, it is
                                       of note that within police forces there has been the reproduction of debates and perspectives
                                       that are antagonistic to the democratic rule of law.

                                             Alliance) was initially opposed to the removal of previous security institutions,
                                             only to later include elements of these institutions in the new police force and new

                                             This led to the creation of an independent investigatory committee named the Joint
                                             Group for the Investigation of Illegal Armed Groups with Political Motivations in

                                             death squads still in operation in the country. These groups would also evolve to
                                             carry out actions of social cleansing exterminating members of youth gangs (maras)
                                             during the 1990s and initial years of the new millennium [<a href="#R42">42</a>].

                                          <p id="d1e314">While political violence declined, the aftermath of the peace agreements continued
                                             to be very violent. Homicidal violence reached very high levels because of competition
                                             among organized crime organizations trying to assert territorial control over cocaine
                                             trade routes [<a href="#R43">43</a>]. Given the lack of police capacity in the 17 years following the peace accords,
                                             the governments of ARENA reintroduced the armed forces into joint rural and urban
                                             patrols with the national police and placed an emphasis on reactive policing in response
                                             to increasing levels of crime. These actions can only be interpreted as a reversal
                                             of the democratic reform of internal security intended by the peace accords. It is
                                             important to note that this change to the police force also clearly reflects a lack
                                             of prioritization of the police by the government.

                                             of security from the citizens back to the state and identifying youth gangs as the
                                             key source of insecurity in the country [<a href="#R44">44</a>, <a href="#R45">45</a>, <a href="#R46">46</a>]. Military intervention in the Salvadorian public security was justified by the reintroduction
                                             of a newly formulated idea of the ‘public enemy’ and recycled war paradigms of security.
                                             During these years violent practices became entrenched in policing. Young, poor, and

                                             remained in police subculture. The police continued to target young poor and marginalized

                                             discourse and initiated a new period of development from 2009 until 2014. Commissioner
                                             Carlos Ascencio, a former guerrilla leader was appointed police director at the beginning
                                             of the FMLN presidential period. In his opening speech in 2009, he called for a re-evaluation
                                             of the police’s development. He argued that strengthening the police required an institutional
                                             self-critique of the initial conception of the police in close relation to the community
                                             and proposed the introduction of an integral approach to security that prioritized
                                             preventive measures and community-oriented practices [<a href="#R14">14</a>].

                                             replacing individuals previously identified with the guerrilla. Sonja Wolff has indicated
                                             these changes were partly the result of US pressures, and partly the consequence of
                                             the president fearing the FMLN was withholding information from him [<a href="#R48">48</a>]. For instance, Brigadier General Francisco Salinas was appointed as the Director
                                             of the Police in 2012, replacing Commissioner Carlos Ascencio who had a COP approach.
                                             The weak capacity of the police to control crime led to an increased role of the military
                                             in public security. According to US estimates, around 8,000 soldiers were working
                                             with the police in 2016 [<a href="#R43">43</a>, <a href="#R49">49</a>].

                                             of public security was made permanent. Repressive actions by joint police and armed

                                             Police Pacification Units (UPP, in Portuguese), which placed communitarian-police
                                             bases in territories controlled by organized criminal groups. In Rio de Janeiro and

                                             been increasingly evident with the incremental use of repression against the maras.

                                             community policing in their locality. Approximately the same percentage (25.5%) answered
                                             that they know the officers assigned to look after and attend their neighborhood.

                                          <p id="d1e389">With the election of Nayib Bukele to the presidency in 2019 there was renewed hope
                                             for a change in the administration of the country and the direction of security policy.
                                             Bukele is young enough not to remember the civil war and is not currently affiliated
                                             with the traditional governing political parties e.g., ARENA and FMLN. Despite the
                                             widespread optimism, local human rights organizations were quick to highlight the
                                             lack of clarity and transparency of Bukele’s new security agenda. The Territorial
                                             Control Plan, a security plan that Bukele has defended since the beginning of his

                                             of them civilians, and 93 percent at the hands of the military. Another 50,000, an

                                             to suppress opposition, capturing, secluding, torturing and frequently eliminating

                                             and prompted many more acts of abuse, including contract-killings and widespread corruption.

                                             margin and confronted a weak fiscal situation. President Álvaro Arzú personalized
                                             the achievement of signing the peace accords and did not follow up with political

                                             the size of the police force to 20,000 to achieve the widest deployment possible throughout
                                             national territory. The Police Academy of the time was only able to train 500 recruits
                                             at a time. The government opted to bring in the Spanish Civilian Guard (Guardia Civil),
                                             to train the new force. The Civilian Guard opted to recruit elements from the disbanded

                                             several projects for community policing in response to initiatives from international
                                             donors. USAID provided support in 2005 for a community policing project focused on
                                             improving the relationship between community members and the police. Another example
                                             was the implementation in 2007 of the <i>Plan Cuadrante de Seguridad Preventiva</i> (Block Plan for Preventative Security) led by the Chilean Carabineros. The pilot
                                             project was initiated in Zones 1 and 2 of Guatemala City and later in the towns of
                                             La Antigua and Quetzaltenango. These foreign funded and contrasting efforts are illustrative

                                             in 2011. Two other regional academies were also created i.e., in Huehuetenango in

                                             in 2018. By 2020 the PNC had grown to 40,693 operational elements (15.6% of which
                                             were women) supported by an administrative staff of 569 (59% women) [<a href="#R65">65</a>].

                                             Under MOPSIC a special unit was set up to train sub-station personnel using a guiding
                                             manual. Locally deployed policemen are expected to make use not only of techniques
                                             for criminal investigation, analysis, and direct control of crime, but to implement
                                             a sustained effort to approach their communities to prevent criminal activities, nurture
                                             trust and collaboration with the population- and in this way prevent violence.

                                             Each of the 130 stations have at least a pair of analysts that compile and verify
                                             information. With this information they formulate a diagnostic of the security situation
                                             and plan responses according to the crime level and resources at hand. The strategy

                                             In each station DIRC personnel have provided support in training and deployed personnel
                                             to fulfill MOPSIC processes. Since 2017 the much larger Sub-Directorate General for

                                          <p id="d1e557">The case of Nicaraguan policing is different to the others previously described. First,
                                             the national police force was not created because of the terms and conclusions of
                                             a peace accord and return of democracy. Previous studies of Nicaraguan policing also
                                             commonly connect the <i>communitarian</i> origins of the police force with the Sandinista Revolution (1978-1990)[<a href="#R30">30</a>]. Existing studies also recognize that the shape and practice of the Nicaraguan COP
                                             model is the result of several generations of change and reform [<a href="#R71">71</a>].

                                          <p id="d1e568">The defeat of the Anastasio Somoza dictatorship marked the end of the Nicaraguan National
                                             Guard, and their substitution by the Sandinista Popular Army and the Sandinista Police.
                                             The Sandinista Police were founded on the 5th of September 1979. With its establishment,
                                             the new government aimed to end the history of open repression carried out by the
                                             earlier National Guard. From 1979 onwards, the Sandinista government decided to separate
                                             the functions of defense and security from that of law enforcement. This resulted
                                             in the creation of the Ministry of Defense and the Sandinista Popular Army, and the
                                             Ministry of the Interior and the Sandinista Police. The New Sandinista Police force
                                             initially counted on the advice and training of Panama, but its equipment and professional
                                             training drew mostly on socialist policy (and particularly East Germany and the example
                                             of Cuba). From 1979 to 1989, the police force was formally tasked ‘‘to guarantee the
                                             status quo and property with revolutionary sentiment, confront crime and assist the
                                             task of securing the state’’ [<a href="#R72">72</a>].

                                             activities [<a href="#R73">73</a>]. However, the government also created the General Direction of State Security which
                                             was independent from the police and carried out intelligence and counterintelligence

                                             government at the end of the 1980s and with the aim of counteracting the legacy of
                                             war, the Sandinista Police started a process of experimentation in which a significant
                                             reduction was made of its technical, human, and material capacities. Significant cuts
                                             were made to the budgets of all parts of the state apparatus. At the same time there
                                             was an increase in the level of crime. This in turn influenced the capacity and attitude
                                             of the police force to exercise the functions with which it had been entrusted.

                                             to decentralize its responses to crime and manifestations of insecurity [<a href="#R73">73</a>]. It did this by establishing broad and permanent channels of communication with
                                             community organizations, both through the formation of community-assemblies and maintaining

                                             police introduced two important elements of their current COP model i.e., committees

                                             between the police and the families, the heads of sector would become members of the

                                             between the national police and different social groups in the community: the prevention
                                             of crime at the level of the community; a focus on gender and prevention amongst children

                                             others. First, the authorized protagonist role of collective actors such as the Committees
                                             for the Social Prevention of Crime (<i>Comités de Prevención Social del Delito</i>) created by a resolution of the Director General of the National Police as ‘‘spaces
                                             for proactive citizen participation’’ [<a href="#R77">77</a>]. Their mandate is specified in the Plan for the Implementation of Integral Police-Community
                                             Human Rights as organizing community assemblies, identifying local problems, and obtaining
                                             resources to solve them [<a href="#R78">78</a>]. A second aspect is undoubtedly the role carried out by the jefe de sector (sector
                                             leader), whose role it is to respond to the community and to consider the linkages
                                             between policing and social challenges. This leads us to a third aspect- undoubtedly
                                             an inheritance of a revolutionary past-, the police are to understand that crime prevention
                                             is also reliant on actions of social development. An example of this is the activities
                                             of the Directorate for Youth Issues of the National Police (<i>Dirección de Asuntos Juveniles de la Policía Nacional</i>). The Directorate carries out interventions in psycho-social issues with youths at
                                             risk of being integrated into organized crime.

                                             elected President. He gradually took control of the other branches of government,
                                             and through a decision of the Supreme Court was allowed to run for office again in
                                             2011. In January 2014 the National Assembly, dominated by the FSLN, approved constitutional
                                             amendments that abolished term limits for the presidency and allowed a president to
                                             run for an unlimited number of five-year terms.

                                          <p id="d1e683">Under Ortega the police became increasingly politicized and repressive. In 2015 the
                                             Nicaraguan government approved the establishment of the Sovereign Security Act. The
                                             Act’s stated objective was to ‘‘preserve, promote, and maintain sovereign security’’
                                             against threats that include transnational organized crime, international terrorism,
                                             foreign interference, criminality, rebellion, illicit acts against aviation and maritime
                                             navigation, attacks against cyber security and infrastructure, or ‘‘any illegal act
                                             that threatens the existence of the Nicaraguan state and its institutions.’’ In the
                                             years that followed the reform, the police’s use of force to stop and break up protests
                                             the government were characterized by government communications as necessary in the
                                             interest of public security and national strategic interest.

                                          <p id="d1e685">In 2017 the security analyst Roberto Cajines suggested in a blog post that the hard-handed
                                             actions of the police against protesters represented ‘‘the profound systematic crisis
                                             in which the Police finds itself, in which the police are now denaturalized and converted
                                             into a body at the service of a dynastic project and the continuance of Daniel Ortega’’
                                             [<a href="#R80">80</a>]. Further signs that democratic conditions were worsening included the way in which
                                             the government has used to the judicial system to ban most of the political opposition
                                             in the run up to elections in November 2016 [<a href="#R81">81</a>]. Days later Ortega also positioned his wife, Rosario Murillo, as the candidate for
                                             the vice-presidency. The revival of the strongman role is interpreted by some analysts
                                             as reflecting an authoritarian turn, and the complete return of the political tradition
                                             for <i>caudillismo</i> in Nicaragua after an interlude of democracy lasting from the Revolution to the return
                                             of Ortega in 2008.

                                          <p id="d1e696">Following success in the 2016 elections, the new government carried out a series of
                                             changes to the set-up of the police and the security forces. Changes were made to
                                             the operation of COP, including the transference of responsibility for programs aimed
                                             at youth, community sports, mothers, and children and at combatting domestic violence
                                             to other government institutions. This has changed the quality of police-community
                                             relations. Whilst from the outside these programs appeared to be beyond the bounds
                                             of the public security mandate of the police, they are acknowledged by national analysts
                                             as having enabled both a close and effective relationship between the community and
                                             the police. The recent removal of responsibility for these programs (the <i>Centros de Juventud</i> remain under police jurisdiction) whilst given explanation in terms of increasing
                                             institutional efficiency, is interpreted at least by some commentators as a politically
                                             motivated strategy by the Presidency to co-opt the popular support surrounding these
                                             programs.

                                          <p id="d1e701">The national administration also notably made a shift at this time towards more heavy-handed
                                             tactics to make up for low police numbers and poor coverage. In rural areas the military
                                             have always had a role in the provision of security and taken a particular role in
                                             combatting the transportation of narcotics along the Nicaraguan Atlantic coast. There
                                             has now been a hightened presence of specially trained police units in Managua and
                                             Bluefields. In the case of Managua this was officially characterized as a response
                                             to the rise in violent crimes in the city. The police put into place the ‘‘Plan for
                                             the Strengthening of Security in the City of Managua’’ which according to official
                                             information is led by the <i>Directorate of Special Police Operations</i> (DOEP). Law 872 of the National Police Law establishes that the DOEP is a specialized
                                             department of the Police that ‘‘corresponds with the intervention to restore public
                                             order in serious altercations, to participate in special operations against drug trafficking,
                                             terrorism, organized crime and other serious crimes’’. This is first time that the
                                             DOEP had been tasked with the response to everyday crimes. It also involves the expanded
                                             use of the black uniformed and heavily armed <i>Dantos Brigade</i> in patrols and responses to reported violent crime in public spaces. According to
                                             Roberto Cajina this is a sign that ‘‘the Police have lost their capacity to prevent
                                             and to be proactive, that they have lost their capacity to anticipate actions and
                                             guarantee the security of the population’’ …it is ‘‘the unfolding of the police special

                                             government to introduce cuts to pensions that would increase workers contributions
                                             and reduce overall benefits. Although the government would cancel the welfare reform
                                             in response to the initial unrest, protest nonetheless spread largely because of the

                                 government institutions. This is particularly evident in the case of Guatemala, where
                                 the influence of civilians and military personnel with this history in the Ministry
                                 of Government (Ministerio de Gobernación) resulted in the formation of a police force
                                 weakened by connections to corruption and organized crime [<a href="#R5">5</a>]. In El Salvador where the effort to construct a new police force has largely been
                                 considered more successful, the ARENA governments worked to integrate members of the
                                 previous military regime in clear opposition of the philosophy and stated intentions
                                 of the Peace Accords. Under these conditions the democratic character of the police
                                 has been permanently affected and their participation in waves of repressive actions
                                 against the gangs has eroded public trust and confidence. As a result, two decades
                                 after the transition to democracy, c. 20% of the citizenry indicate that they do not
                                 depend on the police for their security. This implies that in key areas of the country
                                 there are hybrid systems of security in which citizens themselves intervene or where
                                 private security companies and criminal organisations are in control. All of which
                                 do not respond to democratic norms of the rule of law [<a href="#R5">5</a>, <a href="#R89">89</a>].

                              <p id="d1e751">This reality places in doubt one of the substantial claims of the literature with
                                 regards to the importance of the police for the consolidation of trust in the Salvadorean
                                 and Guatemalan states. Goldsmith argues that trust in policing cannot be examined
                                 separately from trust in government [<a href="#R31">31</a>]. Other authors argue that the actions of the police symbolize the State and therefore
                                 the legitimacy of the police is vital in terms of convincing citizens to obey the
                                 law [<a href="#R90">90</a>]. The invisibility of the police to significant parts of the population in El Salvador
                                 and probably Guatemala limits this argument. This is especially the case given that
                                 this invisibility is not a matter of a lack of resources, but rather the outcome of
                                 decisions by powerful actors in government and policing institutions.

                                 evident that the region’s earlier history of military dictatorship, class division
                                 and armed conflict has cast long shadows into the present. Peace in the region of
                                 Central America was to be secured through the combination of democratic institutions,
                                 the strengthening of civil society, and a set of neoliberal reforms aimed at unleashing
                                 the potential of the local private sectors and foreign investment required for growth
                                 [<a href="#R91">91</a>]. This combination of political liberal democracy and economic neoliberalism was
                                 supported by donors through a variety of assistance programs that led to specific
                                 adjustments. However, the co-existence of electoral democracy with violent practices
                                 sponsored by the State and a weak state of rule of law has generated a political context
                                 that struggles to remain democratic, and clearly affects the efforts to reform the
                                 police [<a href="#R10">10</a>]. Global diffusion and local ‘‘editing’’ [<a href="#R10">10</a>] or ‘‘translation and adaptation’’ of COP programs intermesh to generate policy outcomes
                                 that may adhere to the original model in some ways, but diverge from, or even oppose
                                 its precepts, in others [<a href="#R24">24</a>].

                              <p id="d1e773">The implementation of community policing in Guatemala and El Salvador was further
                                 compromised by the weak capacity of their police forces to control rising homicidal
                                 rates. Based on the argument that crime was at a level beyond the police capacity,
                                 several governments reintroduced the military in public security operations.

                              <p id="d1e775">Our research in two distinct communities in Guatemala clearly evidences the need to
                                 pay attention to the context into which COP programmes are introduced. In Totonicapán
                                 formal policing is secondary to the policing that the community carries out itself,
                                 and trust in the police is based on an understanding that they do not interfere in
                                 the norms and customs of the local population. In contrast, in Villa Canales the population
                                 are overwhelmed by risks and insecurities that the community itself cannot control
                                 on its own. The population there appreciate the increasing level of police effectiveness
                                 but understand the scarcity of resources that affects police operations in their community.

                              <p id="d1e777">The situation in Nicaragua represents a partial contrast to that which has occurred
                                 in Guatemala and El Salvador. Elections in the 1990s obliged the Sandinistas to accept
                                 reform leading to a delinking of the police from politics. This contributed to the
                                 rule of law in the country. Two factors facilitated this transition. The first was
                                 that the levels of violence and crime in the country was a lot lower than in neighboring
                                 countries, to a significant degree assisted by the removal of groups allied with the
                                 Somoza dictatorship. The second, was the formation of a model in which the police
                                 operated in alliance with civil society organizations with origins in Sandinismo.
                                 These unique factors explain the consolidation of a foundation of trust and confidence
                                 not found elsewhere in the region.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e779">In the cases of El Salvador and Guatemala the efforts to support COP programmes initially
                                 corresponded with the initiatives of international donor institutions. This was strongly
                                 exemplified by the support granted to these efforts by multilateral and bilateral
                                 institutions such as the Inter-American Development Bank, GIZ, JICA, Norad and the
                                 European Union. These institutions viewed COP as an appropriate path towards a more
                                 democratic form of policing. In an era of democracy accompanied by ever-rising rates
                                 of crime and violence COP was seen as a method to reform policing, but also to sell
                                 policing to the public [<a href="#R10">10</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e784">Before 2014 there was no solid institutional support to the police in either Guatemala
                                 or El Salvador. However, there were some pilot projects for community policing, and
                                 support for a focus on the issue of gender [<a href="#R14">14</a>]. An aspect that has received little attention is that community policing programmes
                                 emerged without significant reform of institutional contexts. The creation of the
                                 Vice Ministry of Communal Affairs in Guatemala was aimed at creating crime prevention
                                 by funding security committees at the municipal level. The <i>Juntas Locales de Seguridad</i> (Local Security Committees) created in 1999 took place, however, on the foundations
                                 of self-defence committees (autodefensas) that had been founded during the armed conflict.
                                 These committees had been accused of episodes of extra-legal violence and hangings.
                                 Argueta [<a href="#R57">57</a>] characterizes this process as one of layering, in which the institutional norms
                                 that encourage community participation end up reinforcing mechanisms that are anti-democratic.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e795">In the case of Nicaragua, the characteristics of a communitarian police were formed
                                 on the foundations of social organization introduced during the Sandinista Revolution.
                                 Two important characteristics we have highlighted earlier is the emphasis given to
                                 collective organizations in the relationship between police and community, rather
                                 than to individuals or neighbors. The police’s participation in social prevention
                                 programmes is also notable given that it surpasses similar characteristics of policing
                                 studied in other countries. Through these structures the national police were able
                                 to not only generate a strong contact with the local community but ensure the rapid
                                 exchange of information regarding crime and local development concerns. They also
                                 enabled the police to proactively identify threats at an earlier stage and efficiently
                                 intervene to prevent and remove these risks. Changing circumstances, however, make
                                 claims that the Nicaraguan COP model represents an example of good practice in public
                                 security increasingly untenable.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e797">As a result of the institutional changes made by the Nicaraguan government, the police
                                 now have a permanent first commissioner and many of its social programmes with women
                                 and youths removed from their control. Whilst the government argues for this in terms
                                 of bureaucratic efficiency, the removal of these responsibilities from the police
                                 has also removed vital points of communication with the community. The key institutional
                                 mechanisms mentioned above continue to function, but increasing critique is made of
                                 the way in which the Ortega government’s particular brand of ideology i.e., Sandinismo
                                 mixed with conservative Catholicism, has intervened in their operation. Party alliance
                                 appears to be proactively replacing democratic communitarianism as the defining characteristic
                                 of who receives attention from these instances. Indeed, it appears that issue of political
                                 alliances is at least a feature of the growing inability of the national police to
                                 respond to the growing levels of violence and insecurity developing in the Atlantic
                                 Autonomous Regions. In this context the police not only appear partisan but are also
                                 failing to actively prevent rising tensions and further conflict. The extraordinary
                                 violence and public unrest of recent years demonstrate that trust between the police
                                 and community, and the government and community are no longer what they once were.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e800">In our research we have emphasized that COP is a trust building strategy. However,
                                 in studying these three contexts we think it worthwhile to explore the possibility
                                 of a more anthropological orientation in understanding trust and policing. We note
                                 in line with Broch-Due &amp; Ystanes [<a href="#R92">92</a>] that there is a common tendency to assume that trust is essentially the same everywhere.
                                 Borrowing from the work of Broch-Due &amp; Ystanes we echo their argument that trust is
                                 a composite social phenomenon formed in complex social landscapes, each with their
                                 own histories [<a href="#R92">92</a>]. The shared social spaces that trust builds are of different scales, complexity
                                 and duration depending on the specific geographical, cultural, and historical location.
                                 Trusting is built over time and always vulnerable to the countervailing forces of
                                 mistrust, which can overwhelm some social spaces and biographies [<a href="#R92">92</a>]. In other words, local settings that reflect concentrations of ethnic population
                                 or social disadvantage often provide distinct experiences and socialization processes
                                 for residents that impact negatively upon public perceptions of public services including
                                 the police [<a href="#R93">93</a>, <a href="#R94">94</a>, <a href="#R95">95</a>].

                              <p id="d1e821">COP was exported to many countries in the context of a return to civilian rule. COP
                                 plus a better police service were supposed to facilitate a transition to democratic
                                 policing. However, in an authoritarian context COP has served the interests of authoritarian
                                 government. As a result of persisting authoritarian politics and social dynamics,
                                 a breakdown in state-community relations is occurring in all three countries- albeit
                                 with somewhat distinct features and gravity. Significant features of this breakdown
                                 are not only new articulations of civil and political violence, but a major reversal
                                 of the broad agreement on human security- concerned not only with public order, but
                                 well-being- that had started to take root with the establishment of community-oriented
                                 policing in the region.
