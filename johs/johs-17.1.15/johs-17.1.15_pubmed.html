                  <p class="first" id="d1e58">COVID-19 has elevated anew the import of holistically conceiving human-environmental
                     well-being and tackling the overarching precarities of our ecologies, societies and
                     public health in strategies of securitization. This paper considers the key challenge
                     of reimagining securitization in the aftermath of COVID-19 and makes two core arguments.
                     The first is that in addressing precarity a key starting point lies in being mindful
                     of how it is differentially experienced across multiple social hierarchies in the
                     human world. The paper draws upon Judith Butler’s work on ‘frames of seeing’ to consider
                     how our current moment can elicit a contrapuntal concern for those who have always
                     been precarious but not in view. The second core argument is that it is vital to move
                     beyond a concern for human precarity to a concern for a broader sense of planetary
                     precarity, which in turn prompts the need to strategize for a ‘more-than-human’ sense
                     of security. Developing the concept of ‘human security’, the paper reflects on how
                     we can usefully envision a ‘more-than-human security’ for a more biologically stable
                     and sustainable planet. &nbsp;

            <p id="d1e73">Towards the end of Samuel Beckett’s Waiting for Godot, Vladimir declares that ‘‘we
               are no longer alone, waiting for the night’’. He muses that we are all, in fact, metaphorically
               ‘‘waiting for Godot’’, and that life is mostly ‘‘waiting for … waiting’’ [<a href="#R1">1</a>]. The years 2020 and 2021 have felt like that, and throughout the world people have
               felt the urge to fast-forward time to a normality once taken for granted and now craved.
               In adjusting to the new normal, there is undoubtedly a wider appreciation of precarity—no
               longer seen as just happening ‘over there’, to ‘them’ and not to ‘us’—and this is
               important for the global-scale socio-environmental challenges faced. But social and
               environmental precarity continues to be experienced in hugely disparate ways, with
               COVID-19 serving in fact to widen indices of health, poverty and economic inequalities.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e78">Responding to the COVID-19 pandemic has elevated the import of holistically conceiving
               the well-being of our ecologies and societies. In addressing precarity on multiple
               scales, a key starting point lies in seeing precarity and being mindful of how it
               is differentially experienced across class, race, gender, sexuality, disability and
               other social hierarchies in the human world. With this in mind, this paper draws upon
               the work of feminist philosopher and social theorist, Judith Butler, on ‘frames of
               seeing’ to consider how our current moment can elicit a contrapuntal concern for those
               who have always been precarious, by rendering their worlds visible and a constitutive
               part of a globally understood precarity. It then critiques the spatial dynamics and
               excesses of late modern capitalism in contemplating a broader sense of ‘planetary
               precarity’, before considering how the concept of ‘human security’ might usefully
               be extended to envision a ‘more-than-human’ sense of security in responding to COVID-19
               and the likelihood of future pandemics [<a href="#R2">2</a>]. To begin with, however, the paper opens with a reflection on securitization as
               an assemblage of actionable knowledge, asking critically how we come to define and
               frame ‘security’.

            <p id="d1e86">In the late 1970s, the philosopher and social theorist, Michel Foucault, predicted
               that we would increasingly live in a ‘‘society of security’’ ([<a href="#R3">3</a>], p.&nbsp;11). For Foucault, modern society was moving in a direction increasingly typified
               by prevailing discourses of securitization, which underpinned a governmentalized world
               of regulated political, economic and social subjectivity. Across the social sciences
               and humanities in recent years, key contributions have divulged the extent to which
               neoliberal discourses of ‘security’ function centrally in the governing techniques
               of our contemporary world [<a href="#R4">4</a>, <a href="#R5">5</a>, <a href="#R6">6</a>, <a href="#R7">7</a>, <a href="#R8">8</a>]. In the seemingly endless global war on terror, for instance, we have witnessed
               how specific registers of interventionism play pivotal roles in the justification
               of military securitization strategies—where ‘identified’ ‘risk’ becomes discursively
               binded to ‘necessary’ ‘securitization’ [<a href="#R9">9</a>, <a href="#R10">10</a>]. This not only mirrors broader dimensions of contemporary geopolitical grand strategy
               but also echoes a long history of imperialism in which interventionism was legitimized
               and actioned via hegemonic forms of colonial discourse involving registers of threat,
               risk, defense and opportunity [<a href="#R11">11</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e116">[-5]To return to Foucault’s critique of modern society, he incisively laid bare how
               overlapping structures of governing power and governing epistemes reinforce and legitimate
               each other: ‘‘knowledge linked to power not only assumes the authority of ‘the truth’
               but has the power to make itself true’’ ([<a href="#R12">12</a>], p.&nbsp;27). This ‘power-knowledge’ couplet works to enable the discursive hegemony
               of prioritised forms of knowledge that underpin prevailing forms of governance and
               governmentality. In deconstructing global health governance, Foucault’s power-knowledge
               couplet has been usefully drawn upon via the idea of ‘framing’ or ‘issue framing’,
               whereby ‘‘an issue is presented in such a way as to tie into a broader set of ideas
               about the world, or ‘socially constructed reality’, and through this gain influence
               and policy purchase’’ ([<a href="#R13">13</a>], p.&nbsp;3). Framing in global health governance involves what Colin McInnes and Kelley
               Ley call the ‘‘ideational element’’ of the global health security nexus, wherein prioritised
               interventionary policies emerge from an ‘‘arena of competition’’ in which ‘‘ideas
               matter’’ and buttress ‘‘acceptable pathways of government response’’ ([<a href="#R13">13</a>], pp.&nbsp;i, 4). Global health securitization, in other words, like all discourses of
               security, is selective, and framed in highly consequential ways for the enactment
               of global health policy [<a href="#R14">14</a>, <a href="#R15">15</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e133">Recognising the role of framing enables a critique of global health governance that
               sees its policy formation and operationalisation as relying on prioritized ideas of
               threat, risk and security. As Adam Ferhani and Simon Rushton have shown, despite the
               ‘‘internationalist rhetoric governments engage in’’, in the ‘‘face of a crisis’’ this
               commonly evaporates and governments instead ‘‘prioritize the safety of their own citizens,
               their economic interests, and their own political popularity’’ ([<a href="#R16">16</a>], p.&nbsp;466) [<a href="#R17">17</a>]. We have witnessed this in the Global North with the vaccine rollout for COVID-19
               in particular. As Ferhani and Rushton reason, Global North governments find themselves
               (unusually) at ‘‘the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic’’, and have on the whole adopted
               ‘‘nationalistic ‘domestic first’ responses, undermining the possibilities for international
               cooperation’’ ([<a href="#R16">16</a>], p.&nbsp;473). They point to the key ‘global health’ securitization challenge consequently
               faced: generating a shift away from ‘‘disease as a narrow national security concern’’,
               rethinking ‘‘what borders are’’ and reframing ‘global health security’ to ‘‘detect
               and respond to infectious disease outbreaks’’ ([<a href="#R16">16</a>], p.&nbsp;473).

            <p id="d1e150">COVID-19’s securitization is, like all discourses of security, an assemblage of knowledge
               prioritized, framed and communicated in determinative ways. As Judith Butler has noted,
               critiquing how knowledge is constructed begins with a consideration of how it is dominantly
               formed within a ‘‘contemporary social frame’’ ([<a href="#R18">18</a>], p.&nbsp;1). Butler has spent much of her academic career reflecting on ‘‘what it means
               to become ethically responsive, to consider and attend to the suffering of others’’
               ([<a href="#R19">19</a>], p.&nbsp;951) [<a href="#R20">20</a>, <a href="#R21">21</a>, <a href="#R22">22</a>]. In this endeavour, she has illuminated how certain frames of seeing ‘‘permit the
               representability of the human’’, direct ‘‘the way in which suffering is presented
               to us’’, and thus ‘‘affect our responsiveness’’: ‘‘whether and how we respond to the
               suffering of others, how we formulate moral criticisms, how we articulate political
               analyses, depend upon a certain field of perceptible reality’’ ([<a href="#R19">19</a>], p.&nbsp;951). Butler’s broader appreciation of the power of subjection and the consequences
               for our conditioned subjectivity cautions her in considering if we can ‘‘learn to
               see the frame that blinds us to what we see’’([<a href="#R19">19</a>], p.&nbsp;966) [<a href="#R23">23</a>]. Mirroring philosopher Susan Sontag’s concerns in <i>Regarding the Pain of Others</i> [<a href="#R24">24</a>], Butler poses the question of whether or not it is possible to transcend the ‘‘final
               narcissism of our desire to see’’ when we have long been conditioned toward an ‘‘inability
               to see what we see’’ ([<a href="#R19">19</a>], p.&nbsp;966). For Butler, overcoming our conditioned subjectivity requires us to deconstruct
               and theorize the ‘‘forcible frame’’ that imposes ‘‘constraints on what ‘can’ be heard,
               read, seen, felt, and known’’—and this starts with recognizing ‘‘‘not seeing’ in the
               midst of seein’’ ([<a href="#R19">19</a>], p.&nbsp;966).
            </p>
            <p id="d1e190">[-5]‘Not seeing’ the world for Butler is the result of a ‘‘visual norm’’ that conducts
               a ‘‘fateful disavowal’’ of the human suffering of ‘Others’ ([<a href="#R19">19</a>], p.&nbsp;966). This remains a fundamental epistemological challenge, in recognizing,
               for instance, how the COVID-19 pandemic involves a variegated precarity and vulnerability
               across our communities. We have heard much about how responding to the crisis relies
               upon staying at home and retreating to the safety of family units. But as Butler more
               recently notes, ‘‘not everyone has a household or a ‘family’’’, and ‘‘increasing numbers
               of the population’’ are, in fact, ‘‘homeless or transient’’ [<a href="#R25">25</a>]. Therefore configuring the household as a ‘space of protection’ involves a profound
               power-knowledge privileging of some worlds over others. Lynsey Hanley highlights why
               this matters in the context of COVID-19: ‘‘[s]pace—how it’s apportioned, how it’s
               governed, how it’s made available to some and denied to others—is always political
               […] we are being encouraged to imagine that every home and immediate neighbourhood
               is as comfortable and well-resourced as the next: that everyone has a garden, a computer,
               a quiet room to study or work in, and a supermarket and an open space nearby’’ [<a href="#R26">26</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e201">Insisting on the enduring politics of space is vital in bringing into view worlds
               of human suffering that are outside the dominant frame. In this task, we also need
               to acknowledge the implicit racism at the heart of why developed countries have consistently
               ignored precarity that happens ‘over there’. As World Health Organization (WHO) Executive
               Director Mike Ryan recently observed, this is why the Global North was so ‘‘entirely
               complacent of infectious diseases’’ prior to the outbreak of COVID-19 [<a href="#R27">27</a>]. And there is an onus upon us too to highlight the human picture hidden in the many
               soundbite knowledges of the pandemic (particularly on social media and in our dominantly
               market-driven news forums) that circulate reductively and in a manner that dissuades
               empathy and solidarity. The term ‘underlying conditions’ is one such example. As urban
               studies social theorist Ananya Roy notes, this signifier works to reduce social conditions
               to medical symptoms, and in the process hides the backstory: the ‘‘systematic denial
               of robust and affordable health care’’ [<a href="#R28">28</a>]. It also works of course to abhorrently imply that some lives are ultimately disposable.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e209">One could conclude that some lives are indeed disposable, in reflecting on the hierarchical
               privileging of access to the emerging vaccines for COVID-19—which Oxfam has termed
               the ‘inequality virus’ [<a href="#R29">29</a>, <a href="#R30">30</a>]. As Judith Butler once more observes, we are again seeing many in the privileged
               Global North assert their rights to ‘‘live at the expense of others’’ by setting out
               ‘‘those who should be protected against death at all costs and those whose lives are
               considered not worth safeguarding against illness and death’’ [<a href="#R25">25</a>]. Sadly, it seems that social and economic inequality will ensure that COVID-19 discriminates
               in its societal penetration and effects—mirroring how we value lives differently,
               how we support those lives differently, and ultimately how we differentially recognize
               lives in our regimes of representation.

            <p id="d1e223">[-15]In addition to appreciating a differentiated and wider sense of human precarity,
               a core challenge in imagining a more just and sustainable post-COVID-19 world lies
               in articulating a broader sense of <i>planetary precarity</i> that recognizes what Janet Wilson and colleagues call the ‘‘biocentric interconnectedness

               made between human and non-human worlds, and instead frames an understanding of conjoined
               human-environmental precarity on a global scale [<a href="#R32">32</a>]. Planetary precarity may have become more visible as a result of the pandemic, but
               it predates it to the beginning of an era of ecological stress on the planet that
               Paul Crutzen and Eugene Stoermer termed the ‘Anthropocene’ at the turn of the century
               [<a href="#R33">33</a>]. The ‘Anthropocene’, which has also been instructively theorized as the ‘Capitalocene’,
               has been typified by far-reaching ecological impacts on the planet sustained in the
               wake of an ascendant capitalism since the industrial revolution [<a href="#R34">34</a>, <a href="#R35">35</a>, <a href="#R36">36</a>, <a href="#R37">37</a>, <a href="#R38">38</a>]. In distinguishing the Anthropocene twenty years ago, Crutzen and Stoermer concluded
               that a ‘‘strategy leading to sustainability of ecosystems against human induced stresses
               will be one of the great future tasks’’ ([<a href="#R33">33</a>], p.&nbsp;18)—and that task remains. As Antje Bruns reasons, ‘‘socio-ecological burdens’’
               continue to be the ‘‘defining characteristic of the Anthropocene’’, and the COVID-19
               crisis simply brings more into view the already existing stresses on the planet brought
               about by human behaviour ([<a href="#R39">39</a>], p.&nbsp;5).

            <p id="d1e259">[-5]Alerts to the dangers of overstepping environmental boundaries in the process
               of excessive capitalist production are not new, of course—the idea of global warming
               has been present in the scientific community since the 1930s and the WHO has consistently
               warned for over two decades that climate change and habitat degradation pose significant
               overlapping risks in the proliferation of infectious pathogens: ‘‘the spread and increased
               lability of various infectious diseases, new and old, reflects the impacts of demographic,
               environmental, technological and other rapid changes in human ecology’’ ([<a href="#R40">40</a>], p.&nbsp;104). There is no doubt that scientific and social scientific expertise on planetary
               ecological stress needs to impact more in terms critical public scholarship, and a
               crucial challenge lies in insisting on the scalar connections and relational geographies
               of environmental stress and consequent precarity, as David Quammen and others have
               shown [<a href="#R41">41</a>, <a href="#R42">42</a>, <a href="#R43">43</a>]. This is key to what Bruns has highlighted as the necessity of ‘‘zooming out a little’’
               in order to see the interconnected ‘‘struggles and contractions in this era called
               the Anthropocene’’, which is marked by a range of issues, from population growth,
               pollution and climate change, to biodiversity loss and resource grabs that mirror
               the unrelenting goal of capitalist economic growth ([<a href="#R39">39</a>], p.&nbsp;6).
            </p>
            <p id="d1e276">Political economic critiques of late modern capitalism are vital in contextualising
               the challenges of planetary precarity we face. Deregulated extractivism, excessive
               consumerism, overlapping environmental stresses, growing economic inequalities and
               the ecologically unsustainable idea of continuous economic growth collectively demand
               a fundamental reappraisal of what an economy is actually designed for. There is an
               acute need for repeatedly making the argument that market concerns and profit—to the
               detriment of environmental and human health—is no longer acceptable as the rationale
               for ‘development’ and ‘growth’.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e278">Market-driven, econcentric rationales prevail in so many aspects of contemporary life.
               Manifesting in everything from increasingly technocratic forms of government to deepening
               regimes of performance management, such rationales have been seen at the heart of
               global health governance too. As Matt Sparke observes, the governance of global health
               has unobtrusively adapted ‘‘calculations from global finance to manage global health
               interventions’’ ([<a href="#R44">44</a>], p.&nbsp;48). . Sparke’s concerns are echoed by Susan Sell and Owain Williams, who have
               outlined the multiple ‘‘underlying structural effects of capitalism on health’’ that
               are evident at every human-environmental scale—effects that mirror a ‘‘market fundamentalism’’
               that ‘‘profoundly’’ shapes global health governance in areas such as ‘‘trade and investment
               policy’’, ‘‘austerity programs’’, and ‘‘pharmaceutical and food governance’’ ([<a href="#R45">45</a>], p.&nbsp;1). Sell and Williams convincingly show how neoliberal capitalism ‘‘generates
               health outcomes like no other system’’, resulting in what they term ‘‘structurally
               pathogenic’’ negative impacts ([<a href="#R45">45</a>], p.&nbsp;1).

            <p id="d1e289">[-10]Joining the dots on the structural violence wrought by neoliberal capitalism
               on human and environmental health is an urgent and vital task that requires a holistic
               conceptualization of conjoined human and environmental security in the Anthropocene.
               One of the most important connections to illuminate between capitalist productions
               and ecological after-effects on a global scale relates to ‘Big Farm’ agribusiness
               and regulating how we ethically and environmentally produce food [<a href="#R46">46</a>, <a href="#R47">47</a>]. A primary economic driver of ecological stress is the demand for cheap meat that
               has seen a rise in industrial-sized cattle, pig and chicken farming. Apart from the
               well-documented methane emissions and the various core animal welfare issues, intensive
               farming has been linked to ‘‘local biodiversity damage from ammonia emissions’’, deforestation
               due to the ‘‘reliance on protein-rich crops such as soya as animal feed’’, and multiple
               ‘‘detrimental impacts’’ on communities, including the dissemination of ‘‘harmful bacteria,
               viruses and air pollutants’’ [<a href="#R48">48</a>]. In the wildlife food sector, agribusiness has evidently played a central role in
               the emergence of COVID-19, and indeed in many of the other deadly pathogens we have
               seen in recent decades. Karin Brulliard usefully historicizes the consequences of
               a largely unregulated global wildlife trade: ‘‘[COVID-19] began like so many pandemics
               and outbreaks before: inside an animal. The virus’s original host was almost certainly
               a bat […] as was the case with Ebola, SARS, MERS and lesser-known viruses such as
               Nipah and Marburg […] Wild animals have always had viruses coursing through their
               bodies. But a global wildlife trade worth billions of dollars, agricultural intensification,
               deforestation and urbanization are bringing people closer to animals, giving their
               viruses more of what they need to infect us: opportunity’’ [<a href="#R49">49</a>, <a href="#R50">50</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e306">In the hugely profitable exotic food industry, opportunities for infection are being
               facilitated in particular by increased encroachment on wild forests. As Catrin Einhorn
               documents, the ‘‘destruction of forests into fragmented patches is increasing the
               likelihood that viruses and other pathogens will jump from wild animals to humans’’,
               and, as coronaviruses are zoonotic, further outbreaks are not only probable but inevitable
               [<a href="#R51">51</a>]. The United Nations Environment Programme have underscored the worrying global picture:
               ‘‘diseases passed from animals to humans are on the rise, as the world continues to
               see unprecedented destruction of wild habitats by human activity’’ [<a href="#R52">52</a>]. They set out the core challenge of containing transmissions: addressing the ‘‘multiple
               and often interacting threats to ecosystems and wildlife to prevent zoonoses from
               emerging, including habitat loss and fragmentation’’ [<a href="#R52">52</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e317">Agribusiness is the principal force driving habitat loss and ecological fragmentation
               globally today, and we need to be especially attentive to how the industry (and particularly
               major corporations such as Monsanto) has worked to deflect regulation. Rob Wallace
               and colleagues have underlined instructively the ecological and pathological corollaries
               of unregulated agribusiness cutting further and further into the last wild forests
               for exotic food: ‘‘[f]ocusing on outbreak zones ignores the relations shared by global
               economic actors that shape epidemiologies [and] the capital interests backing development-
               and production-induced changes in land use and disease emergence’’ [<a href="#R53">53</a>]. They detail how agribusiness has reconfigured its ‘‘extractivist operations into
               spatially discontinuous networks across territories’’, in which the new geography
               is ‘‘embodied by changes in company management structure, capitalization, subcontracting,
               supply chain substitutions, leasing, and transnational land pooling’’—all of which
               enables economic production that flexibly traverses ‘‘ecologies and political borders’’
               but also generates ‘‘new epidemiologies along the way’’ [<a href="#R53">53</a>]. And they incisively divulge how agribusiness’ major corporations have consistently
               worked ‘‘toward fewer government inspections of farms and processing plants, legislation
               <i>against</i> government surveillance and activist exposé, and legislation against even reporting
               on the specifics of deadly outbreaks in media outlets’’ [<a href="#R53">53</a>]. This is critically important to expose in responding effectively to COVID-19, because
               the cause of the current global pandemic is not found ‘‘just in the object of any
               one infectious agent or its clinical course’’, but rather in ‘‘the field of ecosystemic
               relations that capital and other structural causes have pinned back to their own advantage’’

                  and hatred, our avarice, our data banks and dead ideas, our dead rivers and smoky

            </p>
            <p id="d1e345">Writer and political activist Arundhati Roy’s thoughtful reflection above centres
               on a core challenge of human transition throughout history. Imagining a new and better
               world involves, on the one hand, carefully documenting and understanding the dysfunctions
               of the old, and, on the other, creatively envisioning a greater sense of planetary
               security for the present and future. For the latter task, there are key questions
               to ponder in thinking through how we transition towards a more responsible living
               and governing of the planet. George Monbiot is one of many public commentators who
               have urged governments to respond bravely and ambitiously to the COVID-19 emergency
               by planning to build a different, greener economy [<a href="#R55">55</a>]. And the evidence supports the payoff for investment. The health and well-being
               corollaries of less frenetic economic production are becoming clearer, for example,
               as the fog of excessive travel and consumption clears [<a href="#R56">56</a>]. The improvement in air quality during the various lockdowns is one indicative index
               that can be drawn upon to prompt recognition of the positives for human and environmental
               health in shifting to cleaner modes of transport and energy production [<a href="#R57">57</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e356">Rod Wallace and colleagues have argued that what we need in the world now is nothing
               short of a reintroduction into ‘‘Earth’s cycles of regeneration’, a ‘‘rediscovering
               of our sense of individuation in multitudes beyond capital and the state’’ [<a href="#R53">53</a>]. This equates to a ‘‘disalienation’’ from capitalism’s excesses, which is necessary
               for what they term ‘‘the next great human transition’’ in which we must ‘‘navigate
               out’’ of capitalism’s global circuits of ecological destruction [<a href="#R53">53</a>]. They point to immediate solutions: ‘‘[w]e protect the forest complexity that keeps
               deadly pathogens from lining up hosts for a straight shot onto the world’s travel
               network. We reintroduce livestock and crop diversities, and reintegrate animal and
               crop farming at scales that keep pathogens from ramping up in virulence and geographic
               extent. We allow our food animals to reproduce onsite, restarting the natural selection
               that allows immune evolution to track pathogens in real time’’ [<a href="#R53">53</a>]. These are some of the ways in which we can regulate how we interact with the planet
               in a manner that does not see it as simply another commodity in an unconstrained economy.

            <p id="d1e367">[-20]Author of <i>Against Extinction</i>, geographer Bill Adams, recently pondered how the global lockdown offers a ‘‘window
               into an ecological past’’ and ‘‘a vision of a possible ecological future’’ [<a href="#R58">58</a>]. He wonders whether our rediscovered ‘‘closeness to nature’’ and ‘‘new appreciation
               of each other’’ might lead us to ‘‘imagine a different future’’ [<a href="#R58">58</a>]. Such hopes have been echoed at key nodes of global governance as the pandemic unfolds.
               UN Secretary General, António Guterres, for instance, has asserted that COVID-19 has
               reminded us of ‘‘the price we pay for weaknesses in health systems, social protections
               and public services’’, and that now is the time to ‘‘redouble our efforts to build
               more inclusive and sustainable economies and societies’’ [<a href="#R59">59</a>]. For Guterres, the recovery must result in a different economy, and he points to
               the UN’s 2030 agenda and sustainable development goals as the roadmap. He stresses
               the import of protecting future generations through committed climate action and the
               need for human rights to feature centrally in responding to the crisis [<a href="#R60">60</a>].

            <p id="d1e384">Inspiring declarations become simply rhetoric, of course, unless they are activated
               in tangible and legally binding ways. This requires strengthening and resourcing the
               global governance architecture of UN agencies such as the WHO with the necessary measures
               to effectively oversee states and corporations complying with global conventions.
               Originally dating from the WHO’s World Health Assembly in Boston in 1969, the concept
               and ambition of ‘global health security’ in the form of the International Health Regulations
               (IHR) was rejuvenated in the aftermath of the first SARS coronavirus outbreak in 2002,
               culminating in the revision of the IHR in 2005. The IHR is a legally binding instrument
               of international law that aims for international collaboration in combatting the global
               spread of disease, and empowers the WHO as the main global surveillance system. The
               IHR was designed to oversee cooperation between states, but ‘‘there has been widespread
               contravention’’, and the ‘‘WHO lacks enforcement power’’, as Adam Ferhani and Simon
               Ruston lament ([<a href="#R16">16</a>], p.&nbsp;472).
            </p>
            <p id="d1e389">The COVID-19 pandemic has elicited rigorous debates about the role, responsibility
               and powers of the WHO [<a href="#R61">61</a>, <a href="#R62">62</a>]. During the Ebola outbreak in 2014, its reputation became ‘‘irrefutably damaged’’,
               with the ‘‘general consensus in the global health community that it fell short of
               its leadership responsibilities’’, as Clare Wenham observes, due largely to its shackling
               ‘‘financial and organizational constraints’’ ([<a href="#R63">63</a>], p.&nbsp;1). In the wake of further WHO failures during COVID-19, Tine Hanrieder has
               considered how the organization could be ‘‘strengthened beyond the pandemic’’ given
               the lack of ‘‘political commitment’’ for ‘‘an organization that has been weakened
               over decades’’ by a range of issues including primarily ‘‘underfunded mission creep’’
               ([<a href="#R64">64</a>], p.&nbsp;534). As she notes, positive developments such as ‘‘priority setting’’ and ‘‘strategic
               budgeting’’ might well be consistent aspirations in the WHO but these are sought in
               the context of a now normative model of public-private partnerships championed by
               the WHO’s biggest shareholders, and so ‘‘without a new global social contract for
               public interest policy-making’’ the WHO’s ability to ‘‘further global public health
               will remain limited’’ ([<a href="#R64">64</a>], p.&nbsp;541). As we emerge from COVID-19, there seems no doubt that a key task lies
               in renewing the WHO and enabling a more effective global health governance architecture.
               In this endeavour, envisioning global health securitization is a key challenge.

            <p id="d1e409">The global health security crisis experienced in the wake of COVID-19 was guaranteed
               by a long-established hegemony of narrowly conceived statist security concerns. Dominant
               forms of statist securitization, focused on borders and territorial, military and
               police control, are typically bereft of broader ‘human security’ registers that could
               have been anticipatory of the holistic and people-centred security measures required
               to respond more effectually and cooperatively to a global pandemic [<a href="#R65">65</a>, <a href="#R66">66</a>, <a href="#R67">67</a>, <a href="#R68">68</a>]. When COVID-19 hit, the impoverished understanding and functioning of what constitutes
               ‘security’ was frightfully exposed in the calamitous inadequacies of healthcare infrastructures
               globally. Health security—a core component of the United Nations Development Programme
               (UNDP) ‘human security’ concept—had not previously featured centrally on the security
               agenda [<a href="#R2">2</a>]. It had not been prioritized, and crucially had not been invested in and resourced.
               Historicizing this fact is important. The failure to prepare for COVID-19 did not
               just start in December 2019, but was in fact ‘‘programmed decades ago as the shared
               commons of public health were simultaneously neglected and monetized’’ [<a href="#R53">53</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e430">Mike Davis has argued that the now obvious absence of ‘‘a truly international public
               health infrastructure’’ has shown ‘‘capitalist globalization’’ to be ‘‘biologically
               unsustainable’’ [<a href="#R69">69</a>]. And if capitalism cannot secure public health, then it is surely not fit for future-proofing
               the planet. In confronting COVID-19, furthermore, we have seen how healthcare systems
               exclude people’s access ‘‘on the basis of resources, employment and/or immigration
               status’’, which exposes ‘‘the pressing need for articulating systems that respect,
               protect and guarantee the universal human right of everyone’’, as Dorothy Estrada-Tanck
               observes [<a href="#R70">70</a>]. And registering further the need to envisage security more broadly, Karin Brulliard
               remarks how COVID-19 ‘‘underscores the need for a more holistic ‘one health’ approach,
               which views human, animal and environmental health as interconnected’’ [<a href="#R49">49</a>].

               understood and accepted as it is for the coronavirus?’’ [<a href="#R71">71</a>]. This, once again, is a challenge of envisioning securitization differently and
               more broadly. If we are to progressively tackle climate change, we need to frame an
               interlinked sense of human-environmental security, and mobilize more holistic critical
               knowledges, expertise and governing rationales on overlapping human-environmental
               precarities.

               In this sense, it may be useful to envisage a ‘more-than-human’ sense of security
               in setting out a planetary precarity that mirrors our overlapping human and more-than-human
               world. Envisioning a ‘more-than-human security’ enables an imagining of a post-COVID-19
               world that refutes distinctions between human and non-human worlds, and instead frames
               a picture of interconnected human-environmental precarity on a global scale.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e454">In the aftermath of COVID-19, there is a palpable need for framing and planning for
               a sense of ‘more-than-human security’, in which human security’s component elements
               of ‘health security’ and ‘environmental security’, in particular, are increasingly
               activated in a manner than holistically addresses the overlapping human-environmental
               precarities of our globally interconnected system. This challenge is broader than
               the need to reform and re-resource the WHO [<a href="#R72">72</a>, <a href="#R73">73</a>]. We have reached a point, as Kelley Lee and Julianne Piper have argued, where we
               need a ‘‘fundamental reimagining of global health governance’’, in which governance
               needs to be about “building societies’ resilience across a full range of threats,
               including climate change, pandemic diseases, and economic crises’’, and ‘global health
               security’ must be ‘‘conceptualized as part of a complex adaptive system’’ that poses
               ‘‘novel governance challenges because of higher connectivity, nonlinear dynamics,
               multidirectional patterns of change, and emergent properties’’ ([<a href="#R74">74</a>], pp.&nbsp;530-531). As we emerge from COVID-19, we face an urgent task of framing securitization
               for a more holistically understood and sustainable planet. This challenge centres
               on effecting a vision for a more-than-human sense of security that signals overlapping
               human and environmental concerns, stresses global interconnectedness and the need
               for global solidarity, and ultimately offers a framework for securitization that supersedes
               unilateralism and exceptionalism by seeing human and environmental precarity as conjoined
               and existing beyond borders.

            <p id="d1e468">In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, have we reached a tipping point in thinking
               productively and responsibly about planetary precarity? Up until now, we have been
               living a capitalist fable in many ways. It is clear now that the excessive consumerist
               conceit of late modern capitalism was always biologically unsustainable, and this
               has been shown to have been economically unstable too. Now is the time for brave and
               principled leadership, and not for environmental and political-economic denial, misinformation
               strategies, and tacit support for powerful corporate interests [<a href="#R75">75</a>, <a href="#R76">76</a>, <a href="#R77">77</a>]. As Mike Davis imploringly reasons, we need ‘‘effective responses to present and
               future plagues, ones that mobilize popular courage, give leadership to science, and
               use the resources of a comprehensive system of universal health coverage and public
               medicine’’ [<a href="#R78">78</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e482">In different ways, like Vladimir and Estragon in Samuel Beckett’s <i>Waiting for Godot</i>, we are all waiting now, waiting and hoping for a safer world, and it is not just
               the destitute, the poor, the hungry, the marginalized, the out of view. While we wait,
               we must agitate for a deeper appreciation of planetary precarity and global interconnectedness
               to emerge from COVID-19. Global solidarity and collective responsibility for safeguarding
               the future is more important now than ever before. In strategizing for this critical
               task, convincingly framing a more-than-human sense of security is vital to establishing
               a path towards a healthier and more sustainable planet.

                           the West, as opposed to the reverse trajectory in the Global South.]Apr 7

                           117(47):29246–29248. David A. Relman, author. Opinion: To stop the next pandemic,
                           we need to unravel the origins of COVID-19. Proceedings of the National Academy of
                           Sciences.  [Professor of Medicine, Microbiology and Immunology at Stanford University,
                           David Relman, has considered the various possible origins of SARS-CoV-2 in the Proceedings
                           of the National Academy of Sciences. Although acknowledging the likely source as bat-to-human
                           transition, he reasons convincingly for the possibility too of unintentional release
                           of the virus from a laboratory setting. In either case, his conclusion is that ``COVID-19's
                           origin story will help elucidate the nature of our very precarious coexistence within
                           the biosphere'' (p. 29248)]
