                                 well-being and tackling the overarching precarities of our ecologies, societies and
                                 public health in strategies of securitization. This paper considers the key challenge
                                 of reimagining securitization in the aftermath of COVID-19 and makes two core arguments.
                                 The first is that in addressing precarity a key starting point lies in being mindful
                                 of how it is differentially experienced across multiple social hierarchies in the
                                 human world. The paper draws upon Judith Butler’s work on ‘frames of seeing’ to consider
                                 how our current moment can elicit a contrapuntal concern for those who have always
                                 been precarious but not in view. The second core argument is that it is vital to move
                                 beyond a concern for human precarity to a concern for a broader sense of planetary
                                 precarity, which in turn prompts the need to strategize for a ‘more-than-human’ sense
                                 of security. Developing the concept of ‘human security’, the paper reflects on how
                                 we can usefully envision a ‘more-than-human security’ for a more biologically stable
                                 and sustainable planet. &nbsp;</span></div>

                              <p id="d1e73">Towards the end of Samuel Beckett’s Waiting for Godot, Vladimir declares that ‘‘we
                                 are no longer alone, waiting for the night’’. He muses that we are all, in fact, metaphorically
                                 ‘‘waiting for Godot’’, and that life is mostly ‘‘waiting for … waiting’’ [<a href="#R1">1</a>]. The years 2020 and 2021 have felt like that, and throughout the world people have
                                 felt the urge to fast-forward time to a normality once taken for granted and now craved.
                                 In adjusting to the new normal, there is undoubtedly a wider appreciation of precarity—no
                                 longer seen as just happening ‘over there’, to ‘them’ and not to ‘us’—and this is
                                 important for the global-scale socio-environmental challenges faced. But social and
                                 environmental precarity continues to be experienced in hugely disparate ways, with
                                 COVID-19 serving in fact to widen indices of health, poverty and economic inequalities.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e78">Responding to the COVID-19 pandemic has elevated the import of holistically conceiving
                                 the well-being of our ecologies and societies. In addressing precarity on multiple
                                 scales, a key starting point lies in seeing precarity and being mindful of how it
                                 is differentially experienced across class, race, gender, sexuality, disability and
                                 other social hierarchies in the human world. With this in mind, this paper draws upon
                                 the work of feminist philosopher and social theorist, Judith Butler, on ‘frames of
                                 seeing’ to consider how our current moment can elicit a contrapuntal concern for those
                                 who have always been precarious, by rendering their worlds visible and a constitutive
                                 part of a globally understood precarity. It then critiques the spatial dynamics and
                                 excesses of late modern capitalism in contemplating a broader sense of ‘planetary
                                 precarity’, before considering how the concept of ‘human security’ might usefully
                                 be extended to envision a ‘more-than-human’ sense of security in responding to COVID-19
                                 and the likelihood of future pandemics [<a href="#R2">2</a>]. To begin with, however, the paper opens with a reflection on securitization as
                                 an assemblage of actionable knowledge, asking critically how we come to define and
                                 frame ‘security’.

                              <p id="d1e86">In the late 1970s, the philosopher and social theorist, Michel Foucault, predicted
                                 that we would increasingly live in a ‘‘society of security’’ ([<a href="#R3">3</a>], p.&nbsp;11). For Foucault, modern society was moving in a direction increasingly typified
                                 by prevailing discourses of securitization, which underpinned a governmentalized world
                                 of regulated political, economic and social subjectivity. Across the social sciences
                                 and humanities in recent years, key contributions have divulged the extent to which
                                 neoliberal discourses of ‘security’ function centrally in the governing techniques
                                 of our contemporary world [<a href="#R4">4</a>, <a href="#R5">5</a>, <a href="#R6">6</a>, <a href="#R7">7</a>, <a href="#R8">8</a>]. In the seemingly endless global war on terror, for instance, we have witnessed
                                 how specific registers of interventionism play pivotal roles in the justification
                                 of military securitization strategies—where ‘identified’ ‘risk’ becomes discursively
                                 binded to ‘necessary’ ‘securitization’ [<a href="#R9">9</a>, <a href="#R10">10</a>]. This not only mirrors broader dimensions of contemporary geopolitical grand strategy
                                 but also echoes a long history of imperialism in which interventionism was legitimized
                                 and actioned via hegemonic forms of colonial discourse involving registers of threat,
                                 risk, defense and opportunity [<a href="#R11">11</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e116">To return to Foucault’s critique of modern society, he incisively laid bare how overlapping
                                 structures of governing power and governing epistemes reinforce and legitimate each
                                 other: ‘‘knowledge linked to power not only assumes the authority of ‘the truth’ but
                                 has the power to make itself true’’ ([<a href="#R12">12</a>], p.&nbsp;27). This ‘power-knowledge’ couplet works to enable the discursive hegemony
                                 of prioritised forms of knowledge that underpin prevailing forms of governance and
                                 governmentality. In deconstructing global health governance, Foucault’s power-knowledge
                                 couplet has been usefully drawn upon via the idea of ‘framing’ or ‘issue framing’,
                                 whereby ‘‘an issue is presented in such a way as to tie into a broader set of ideas
                                 about the world, or ‘socially constructed reality’, and through this gain influence
                                 and policy purchase’’ ([<a href="#R13">13</a>], p.&nbsp;3). Framing in global health governance involves what Colin McInnes and Kelley
                                 Ley call the ‘‘ideational element’’ of the global health security nexus, wherein prioritised
                                 interventionary policies emerge from an ‘‘arena of competition’’ in which ‘‘ideas
                                 matter’’ and buttress ‘‘acceptable pathways of government response’’ ([<a href="#R13">13</a>], pp.&nbsp;i, 4). Global health securitization, in other words, like all discourses of
                                 security, is selective, and framed in highly consequential ways for the enactment
                                 of global health policy [<a href="#R14">14</a>, <a href="#R15">15</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e133">Recognising the role of framing enables a critique of global health governance that
                                 sees its policy formation and operationalisation as relying on prioritized ideas of
                                 threat, risk and security. As Adam Ferhani and Simon Rushton have shown, despite the
                                 ‘‘internationalist rhetoric governments engage in’’, in the ‘‘face of a crisis’’ this
                                 commonly evaporates and governments instead ‘‘prioritize the safety of their own citizens,
                                 their economic interests, and their own political popularity’’ ([<a href="#R16">16</a>], p.&nbsp;466) [<a href="#R17">17</a>]. We have witnessed this in the Global North with the vaccine rollout for COVID-19
                                 in particular. As Ferhani and Rushton reason, Global North governments find themselves
                                 (unusually) at ‘‘the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic’’, and have on the whole adopted
                                 ‘‘nationalistic ‘domestic first’ responses, undermining the possibilities for international
                                 cooperation’’ ([<a href="#R16">16</a>], p.&nbsp;473). They point to the key ‘global health’ securitization challenge consequently
                                 faced: generating a shift away from ‘‘disease as a narrow national security concern’’,
                                 rethinking ‘‘what borders are’’ and reframing ‘global health security’ to ‘‘detect
                                 and respond to infectious disease outbreaks’’ ([<a href="#R16">16</a>], p.&nbsp;473).

                              <p id="d1e150">COVID-19’s securitization is, like all discourses of security, an assemblage of knowledge
                                 prioritized, framed and communicated in determinative ways. As Judith Butler has noted,
                                 critiquing how knowledge is constructed begins with a consideration of how it is dominantly
                                 formed within a ‘‘contemporary social frame’’ ([<a href="#R18">18</a>], p.&nbsp;1). Butler has spent much of her academic career reflecting on ‘‘what it means
                                 to become ethically responsive, to consider and attend to the suffering of others’’
                                 ([<a href="#R19">19</a>], p.&nbsp;951) [<a href="#R20">20</a>, <a href="#R21">21</a>, <a href="#R22">22</a>]. In this endeavour, she has illuminated how certain frames of seeing ‘‘permit the
                                 representability of the human’’, direct ‘‘the way in which suffering is presented
                                 to us’’, and thus ‘‘affect our responsiveness’’: ‘‘whether and how we respond to the
                                 suffering of others, how we formulate moral criticisms, how we articulate political
                                 analyses, depend upon a certain field of perceptible reality’’ ([<a href="#R19">19</a>], p.&nbsp;951). Butler’s broader appreciation of the power of subjection and the consequences
                                 for our conditioned subjectivity cautions her in considering if we can ‘‘learn to
                                 see the frame that blinds us to what we see’’([<a href="#R19">19</a>], p.&nbsp;966) [<a href="#R23">23</a>]. Mirroring philosopher Susan Sontag’s concerns in <i>Regarding the Pain of Others</i> [<a href="#R24">24</a>], Butler poses the question of whether or not it is possible to transcend the ‘‘final
                                 narcissism of our desire to see’’ when we have long been conditioned toward an ‘‘inability
                                 to see what we see’’ ([<a href="#R19">19</a>], p.&nbsp;966). For Butler, overcoming our conditioned subjectivity requires us to deconstruct
                                 and theorize the ‘‘forcible frame’’ that imposes ‘‘constraints on what ‘can’ be heard,
                                 read, seen, felt, and known’’—and this starts with recognizing ‘‘‘not seeing’ in the
                                 midst of seein’’ ([<a href="#R19">19</a>], p.&nbsp;966).
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e190">‘Not seeing’ the world for Butler is the result of a ‘‘visual norm’’ that conducts
                                 a ‘‘fateful disavowal’’ of the human suffering of ‘Others’ ([<a href="#R19">19</a>], p.&nbsp;966). This remains a fundamental epistemological challenge, in recognizing,
                                 for instance, how the COVID-19 pandemic involves a variegated precarity and vulnerability
                                 across our communities. We have heard much about how responding to the crisis relies
                                 upon staying at home and retreating to the safety of family units. But as Butler more
                                 recently notes, ‘‘not everyone has a household or a ‘family’’’, and ‘‘increasing numbers
                                 of the population’’ are, in fact, ‘‘homeless or transient’’ [<a href="#R25">25</a>]. Therefore configuring the household as a ‘space of protection’ involves a profound
                                 power-knowledge privileging of some worlds over others. Lynsey Hanley highlights why
                                 this matters in the context of COVID-19: ‘‘[s]pace—how it’s apportioned, how it’s
                                 governed, how it’s made available to some and denied to others—is always political
                                 […] we are being encouraged to imagine that every home and immediate neighbourhood
                                 is as comfortable and well-resourced as the next: that everyone has a garden, a computer,
                                 a quiet room to study or work in, and a supermarket and an open space nearby’’ [<a href="#R26">26</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e201">Insisting on the enduring politics of space is vital in bringing into view worlds
                                 of human suffering that are outside the dominant frame. In this task, we also need
                                 to acknowledge the implicit racism at the heart of why developed countries have consistently
                                 ignored precarity that happens ‘over there’. As World Health Organization (WHO) Executive
                                 Director Mike Ryan recently observed, this is why the Global North was so ‘‘entirely
                                 complacent of infectious diseases’’ prior to the outbreak of COVID-19 [<a href="#R27">27</a>]. And there is an onus upon us too to highlight the human picture hidden in the many
                                 soundbite knowledges of the pandemic (particularly on social media and in our dominantly
                                 market-driven news forums) that circulate reductively and in a manner that dissuades
                                 empathy and solidarity. The term ‘underlying conditions’ is one such example. As urban
                                 studies social theorist Ananya Roy notes, this signifier works to reduce social conditions
                                 to medical symptoms, and in the process hides the backstory: the ‘‘systematic denial
                                 of robust and affordable health care’’ [<a href="#R28">28</a>]. It also works of course to abhorrently imply that some lives are ultimately disposable.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e209">One could conclude that some lives are indeed disposable, in reflecting on the hierarchical
                                 privileging of access to the emerging vaccines for COVID-19—which Oxfam has termed
                                 the ‘inequality virus’ [<a href="#R29">29</a>, <a href="#R30">30</a>]. As Judith Butler once more observes, we are again seeing many in the privileged
                                 Global North assert their rights to ‘‘live at the expense of others’’ by setting out
                                 ‘‘those who should be protected against death at all costs and those whose lives are
                                 considered not worth safeguarding against illness and death’’ [<a href="#R25">25</a>]. Sadly, it seems that social and economic inequality will ensure that COVID-19 discriminates
                                 in its societal penetration and effects—mirroring how we value lives differently,
                                 how we support those lives differently, and ultimately how we differentially recognize
                                 lives in our regimes of representation.

                              <p id="d1e223">In addition to appreciating a differentiated and wider sense of human precarity, a
                                 core challenge in imagining a more just and sustainable post-COVID-19 world lies in
                                 articulating a broader sense of <i>planetary precarity</i> that recognizes what Janet Wilson and colleagues call the ‘‘biocentric interconnectedness
                                 of the human and more-than-human world’’ ([<a href="#R31">31</a>], p.&nbsp;444). Such a sense of precarity refuses the spurious distinctions so frequently
                                 made between human and non-human worlds, and instead frames an understanding of conjoined
                                 human-environmental precarity on a global scale [<a href="#R32">32</a>]. Planetary precarity may have become more visible as a result of the pandemic, but
                                 it predates it to the beginning of an era of ecological stress on the planet that
                                 Paul Crutzen and Eugene Stoermer termed the ‘Anthropocene’ at the turn of the century
                                 [<a href="#R33">33</a>]. The ‘Anthropocene’, which has also been instructively theorized as the ‘Capitalocene’,
                                 has been typified by far-reaching ecological impacts on the planet sustained in the
                                 wake of an ascendant capitalism since the industrial revolution [<a href="#R34">34</a>, <a href="#R35">35</a>, <a href="#R36">36</a>, <a href="#R37">37</a>, <a href="#R38">38</a>]. In distinguishing the Anthropocene twenty years ago, Crutzen and Stoermer concluded
                                 that a ‘‘strategy leading to sustainability of ecosystems against human induced stresses
                                 will be one of the great future tasks’’ ([<a href="#R33">33</a>], p.&nbsp;18)—and that task remains. As Antje Bruns reasons, ‘‘socio-ecological burdens’’
                                 continue to be the ‘‘defining characteristic of the Anthropocene’’, and the COVID-19
                                 crisis simply brings more into view the already existing stresses on the planet brought
                                 about by human behaviour ([<a href="#R39">39</a>], p.&nbsp;5).

                                 capitalist production are not new, of course—the idea of global warming has been present
                                 in the scientific community since the 1930s and the WHO has consistently warned for
                                 over two decades that climate change and habitat degradation pose significant overlapping
                                 risks in the proliferation of infectious pathogens: ‘‘the spread and increased lability
                                 of various infectious diseases, new and old, reflects the impacts of demographic,
                                 environmental, technological and other rapid changes in human ecology’’ ([<a href="#R40">40</a>], p.&nbsp;104). There is no doubt that scientific and social scientific expertise on planetary
                                 ecological stress needs to impact more in terms critical public scholarship, and a
                                 crucial challenge lies in insisting on the scalar connections and relational geographies
                                 of environmental stress and consequent precarity, as David Quammen and others have
                                 shown [<a href="#R41">41</a>, <a href="#R42">42</a>, <a href="#R43">43</a>]. This is key to what Bruns has highlighted as the necessity of ‘‘zooming out a little’’
                                 in order to see the interconnected ‘‘struggles and contractions in this era called
                                 the Anthropocene’’, which is marked by a range of issues, from population growth,
                                 pollution and climate change, to biodiversity loss and resource grabs that mirror
                                 the unrelenting goal of capitalist economic growth ([<a href="#R39">39</a>], p.&nbsp;6).

                                 a fundamental reappraisal of what an economy is actually designed for. There is an
                                 acute need for repeatedly making the argument that market concerns and profit—to the
                                 detriment of environmental and human health—is no longer acceptable as the rationale

                                 regimes of performance management, such rationales have been seen at the heart of
                                 global health governance too. As Matt Sparke observes, the governance of global health
                                 has unobtrusively adapted ‘‘calculations from global finance to manage global health
                                 interventions’’ ([<a href="#R44">44</a>], p.&nbsp;48). . Sparke’s concerns are echoed by Susan Sell and Owain Williams, who have
                                 outlined the multiple ‘‘underlying structural effects of capitalism on health’’ that
                                 are evident at every human-environmental scale—effects that mirror a ‘‘market fundamentalism’’
                                 that ‘‘profoundly’’ shapes global health governance in areas such as ‘‘trade and investment
                                 policy’’, ‘‘austerity programs’’, and ‘‘pharmaceutical and food governance’’ ([<a href="#R45">45</a>], p.&nbsp;1). Sell and Williams convincingly show how neoliberal capitalism ‘‘generates
                                 health outcomes like no other system’’, resulting in what they term ‘‘structurally
                                 pathogenic’’ negative impacts ([<a href="#R45">45</a>], p.&nbsp;1).

                                 and environmental health is an urgent and vital task that requires a holistic conceptualization
                                 of conjoined human and environmental security in the Anthropocene. One of the most
                                 important connections to illuminate between capitalist productions and ecological
                                 after-effects on a global scale relates to ‘Big Farm’ agribusiness and regulating
                                 how we ethically and environmentally produce food [<a href="#R46">46</a>, <a href="#R47">47</a>]. A primary economic driver of ecological stress is the demand for cheap meat that
                                 has seen a rise in industrial-sized cattle, pig and chicken farming. Apart from the
                                 well-documented methane emissions and the various core animal welfare issues, intensive
                                 farming has been linked to ‘‘local biodiversity damage from ammonia emissions’’, deforestation
                                 due to the ‘‘reliance on protein-rich crops such as soya as animal feed’’, and multiple
                                 ‘‘detrimental impacts’’ on communities, including the dissemination of ‘‘harmful bacteria,
                                 viruses and air pollutants’’ [<a href="#R48">48</a>]. In the wildlife food sector, agribusiness has evidently played a central role in
                                 the emergence of COVID-19, and indeed in many of the other deadly pathogens we have
                                 seen in recent decades. Karin Brulliard usefully historicizes the consequences of
                                 a largely unregulated global wildlife trade: ‘‘[COVID-19] began like so many pandemics
                                 and outbreaks before: inside an animal. The virus’s original host was almost certainly
                                 a bat […] as was the case with Ebola, SARS, MERS and lesser-known viruses such as
                                 Nipah and Marburg […] Wild animals have always had viruses coursing through their
                                 bodies. But a global wildlife trade worth billions of dollars, agricultural intensification,
                                 deforestation and urbanization are bringing people closer to animals, giving their
                                 viruses more of what they need to infect us: opportunity’’ [<a href="#R49">49</a>, <a href="#R50">50</a>].

                              <p id="d1e306">In the hugely profitable exotic food industry, opportunities for infection are being
                                 facilitated in particular by increased encroachment on wild forests. As Catrin Einhorn
                                 documents, the ‘‘destruction of forests into fragmented patches is increasing the
                                 likelihood that viruses and other pathogens will jump from wild animals to humans’’,
                                 and, as coronaviruses are zoonotic, further outbreaks are not only probable but inevitable
                                 [<a href="#R51">51</a>]. The United Nations Environment Programme have underscored the worrying global picture:
                                 ‘‘diseases passed from animals to humans are on the rise, as the world continues to
                                 see unprecedented destruction of wild habitats by human activity’’ [<a href="#R52">52</a>]. They set out the core challenge of containing transmissions: addressing the ‘‘multiple
                                 and often interacting threats to ecosystems and wildlife to prevent zoonoses from
                                 emerging, including habitat loss and fragmentation’’ [<a href="#R52">52</a>].

                                 globally today, and we need to be especially attentive to how the industry (and particularly
                                 major corporations such as Monsanto) has worked to deflect regulation. Rob Wallace
                                 and colleagues have underlined instructively the ecological and pathological corollaries
                                 of unregulated agribusiness cutting further and further into the last wild forests
                                 for exotic food: ‘‘[f]ocusing on outbreak zones ignores the relations shared by global

                                 and production-induced changes in land use and disease emergence’’ [<a href="#R53">53</a>]. They detail how agribusiness has reconfigured its ‘‘extractivist operations into
                                 spatially discontinuous networks across territories’’, in which the new geography
                                 is ‘‘embodied by changes in company management structure, capitalization, subcontracting,
                                 supply chain substitutions, leasing, and transnational land pooling’’—all of which
                                 enables economic production that flexibly traverses ‘‘ecologies and political borders’’
                                 but also generates ‘‘new epidemiologies along the way’’ [<a href="#R53">53</a>]. And they incisively divulge how agribusiness’ major corporations have consistently
                                 worked ‘‘toward fewer government inspections of farms and processing plants, legislation
                                 <i>against</i> government surveillance and activist exposé, and legislation against even reporting
                                 on the specifics of deadly outbreaks in media outlets’’ [<a href="#R53">53</a>]. This is critically important to expose in responding effectively to COVID-19, because
                                 the cause of the current global pandemic is not found ‘‘just in the object of any
                                 one infectious agent or its clinical course’’, but rather in ‘‘the field of ecosystemic
                                 relations that capital and other structural causes have pinned back to their own advantage’’

                                 on a core challenge of human transition throughout history. Imagining a new and better
                                 world involves, on the one hand, carefully documenting and understanding the dysfunctions
                                 of the old, and, on the other, creatively envisioning a greater sense of planetary
                                 security for the present and future. For the latter task, there are key questions
                                 to ponder in thinking through how we transition towards a more responsible living
                                 and governing of the planet. George Monbiot is one of many public commentators who
                                 have urged governments to respond bravely and ambitiously to the COVID-19 emergency
                                 by planning to build a different, greener economy [<a href="#R55">55</a>]. And the evidence supports the payoff for investment. The health and well-being
                                 corollaries of less frenetic economic production are becoming clearer, for example,
                                 as the fog of excessive travel and consumption clears [<a href="#R56">56</a>]. The improvement in air quality during the various lockdowns is one indicative index
                                 that can be drawn upon to prompt recognition of the positives for human and environmental
                                 health in shifting to cleaner modes of transport and energy production [<a href="#R57">57</a>].

                              <p id="d1e356">Rod Wallace and colleagues have argued that what we need in the world now is nothing
                                 short of a reintroduction into ‘‘Earth’s cycles of regeneration’, a ‘‘rediscovering
                                 of our sense of individuation in multitudes beyond capital and the state’’ [<a href="#R53">53</a>]. This equates to a ‘‘disalienation’’ from capitalism’s excesses, which is necessary
                                 for what they term ‘‘the next great human transition’’ in which we must ‘‘navigate
                                 out’’ of capitalism’s global circuits of ecological destruction [<a href="#R53">53</a>]. They point to immediate solutions: ‘‘[w]e protect the forest complexity that keeps

                                 network. We reintroduce livestock and crop diversities, and reintegrate animal and
                                 crop farming at scales that keep pathogens from ramping up in virulence and geographic
                                 extent. We allow our food animals to reproduce onsite, restarting the natural selection
                                 that allows immune evolution to track pathogens in real time’’ [<a href="#R53">53</a>]. These are some of the ways in which we can regulate how we interact with the planet
                                 in a manner that does not see it as simply another commodity in an unconstrained economy.

                              <p id="d1e367">Author of <i>Against Extinction</i>, geographer Bill Adams, recently pondered how the global lockdown offers a ‘‘window
                                 into an ecological past’’ and ‘‘a vision of a possible ecological future’’ [<a href="#R58">58</a>]. He wonders whether our rediscovered ‘‘closeness to nature’’ and ‘‘new appreciation
                                 of each other’’ might lead us to ‘‘imagine a different future’’ [<a href="#R58">58</a>]. Such hopes have been echoed at key nodes of global governance as the pandemic unfolds.
                                 UN Secretary General, António Guterres, for instance, has asserted that COVID-19 has
                                 reminded us of ‘‘the price we pay for weaknesses in health systems, social protections
                                 and public services’’, and that now is the time to ‘‘redouble our efforts to build
                                 more inclusive and sustainable economies and societies’’ [<a href="#R59">59</a>]. For Guterres, the recovery must result in a different economy, and he points to
                                 the UN’s 2030 agenda and sustainable development goals as the roadmap. He stresses
                                 the import of protecting future generations through committed climate action and the
                                 need for human rights to feature centrally in responding to the crisis [<a href="#R60">60</a>].

                                 in tangible and legally binding ways. This requires strengthening and resourcing the
                                 global governance architecture of UN agencies such as the WHO with the necessary measures
                                 to effectively oversee states and corporations complying with global conventions.
                                 Originally dating from the WHO’s World Health Assembly in Boston in 1969, the concept
                                 and ambition of ‘global health security’ in the form of the International Health Regulations
                                 (IHR) was rejuvenated in the aftermath of the first SARS coronavirus outbreak in 2002,
                                 culminating in the revision of the IHR in 2005. The IHR is a legally binding instrument
                                 of international law that aims for international collaboration in combatting the global
                                 spread of disease, and empowers the WHO as the main global surveillance system. The
                                 IHR was designed to oversee cooperation between states, but ‘‘there has been widespread
                                 contravention’’, and the ‘‘WHO lacks enforcement power’’, as Adam Ferhani and Simon
                                 Ruston lament ([<a href="#R16">16</a>], p.&nbsp;472).

                              <p id="d1e389">The COVID-19 pandemic has elicited rigorous debates about the role, responsibility
                                 and powers of the WHO [<a href="#R61">61</a>, <a href="#R62">62</a>]. During the Ebola outbreak in 2014, its reputation became ‘‘irrefutably damaged’’,
                                 with the ‘‘general consensus in the global health community that it fell short of
                                 its leadership responsibilities’’, as Clare Wenham observes, due largely to its shackling
                                 ‘‘financial and organizational constraints’’ ([<a href="#R63">63</a>], p.&nbsp;1). In the wake of further WHO failures during COVID-19, Tine Hanrieder has
                                 considered how the organization could be ‘‘strengthened beyond the pandemic’’ given
                                 the lack of ‘‘political commitment’’ for ‘‘an organization that has been weakened
                                 over decades’’ by a range of issues including primarily ‘‘underfunded mission creep’’
                                 ([<a href="#R64">64</a>], p.&nbsp;534). As she notes, positive developments such as ‘‘priority setting’’ and ‘‘strategic
                                 budgeting’’ might well be consistent aspirations in the WHO but these are sought in
                                 the context of a now normative model of public-private partnerships championed by
                                 the WHO’s biggest shareholders, and so ‘‘without a new global social contract for
                                 public interest policy-making’’ the WHO’s ability to ‘‘further global public health
                                 will remain limited’’ ([<a href="#R64">64</a>], p.&nbsp;541). As we emerge from COVID-19, there seems no doubt that a key task lies
                                 in renewing the WHO and enabling a more effective global health governance architecture.
                                 In this endeavour, envisioning global health securitization is a key challenge.

                              <p id="d1e409">The global health security crisis experienced in the wake of COVID-19 was guaranteed
                                 by a long-established hegemony of narrowly conceived statist security concerns. Dominant
                                 forms of statist securitization, focused on borders and territorial, military and
                                 police control, are typically bereft of broader ‘human security’ registers that could
                                 have been anticipatory of the holistic and people-centred security measures required
                                 to respond more effectually and cooperatively to a global pandemic [<a href="#R65">65</a>, <a href="#R66">66</a>, <a href="#R67">67</a>, <a href="#R68">68</a>]. When COVID-19 hit, the impoverished understanding and functioning of what constitutes
                                 ‘security’ was frightfully exposed in the calamitous inadequacies of healthcare infrastructures
                                 globally. Health security—a core component of the United Nations Development Programme
                                 (UNDP) ‘human security’ concept—had not previously featured centrally on the security
                                 agenda [<a href="#R2">2</a>]. It had not been prioritized, and crucially had not been invested in and resourced.
                                 Historicizing this fact is important. The failure to prepare for COVID-19 did not
                                 just start in December 2019, but was in fact ‘‘programmed decades ago as the shared
                                 commons of public health were simultaneously neglected and monetized’’ [<a href="#R53">53</a>].

                              <p id="d1e430">Mike Davis has argued that the now obvious absence of ‘‘a truly international public
                                 health infrastructure’’ has shown ‘‘capitalist globalization’’ to be ‘‘biologically
                                 unsustainable’’ [<a href="#R69">69</a>]. And if capitalism cannot secure public health, then it is surely not fit for future-proofing
                                 the planet. In confronting COVID-19, furthermore, we have seen how healthcare systems
                                 exclude people’s access ‘‘on the basis of resources, employment and/or immigration
                                 status’’, which exposes ‘‘the pressing need for articulating systems that respect,
                                 protect and guarantee the universal human right of everyone’’, as Dorothy Estrada-Tanck
                                 observes [<a href="#R70">70</a>]. And registering further the need to envisage security more broadly, Karin Brulliard
                                 remarks how COVID-19 ‘‘underscores the need for a more holistic ‘one health’ approach,

                                 understood and accepted as it is for the coronavirus?’’ [<a href="#R71">71</a>]. This, once again, is a challenge of envisioning securitization differently and
                                 more broadly. If we are to progressively tackle climate change, we need to frame an
                                 interlinked sense of human-environmental security, and mobilize more holistic critical
                                 knowledges, expertise and governing rationales on overlapping human-environmental
                                 precarities.

                                 of climate action and sustainability, considering how the UNDP’s 1994 concept of ‘human
                                 security’ might be constructively extended can aid us [<a href="#R2">2</a>]. Despite its seven components, human security as a singular signifier is discursively
                                 centred on <i>human security</i>, which in turn misses a vital signalling of conjoined human and non-human precarity.
                                 In this sense, it may be useful to envisage a ‘more-than-human’ sense of security
                                 in setting out a planetary precarity that mirrors our overlapping human and more-than-human
                                 world. Envisioning a ‘more-than-human security’ enables an imagining of a post-COVID-19
                                 world that refutes distinctions between human and non-human worlds, and instead frames
                                 a picture of interconnected human-environmental precarity on a global scale.

                              <p id="d1e454">In the aftermath of COVID-19, there is a palpable need for framing and planning for
                                 a sense of ‘more-than-human security’, in which human security’s component elements
                                 of ‘health security’ and ‘environmental security’, in particular, are increasingly
                                 activated in a manner than holistically addresses the overlapping human-environmental
                                 precarities of our globally interconnected system. This challenge is broader than
                                 the need to reform and re-resource the WHO [<a href="#R72">72</a>, <a href="#R73">73</a>]. We have reached a point, as Kelley Lee and Julianne Piper have argued, where we
                                 need a ‘‘fundamental reimagining of global health governance’’, in which governance
                                 needs to be about “building societies’ resilience across a full range of threats,
                                 including climate change, pandemic diseases, and economic crises’’, and ‘global health
                                 security’ must be ‘‘conceptualized as part of a complex adaptive system’’ that poses
                                 ‘‘novel governance challenges because of higher connectivity, nonlinear dynamics,
                                 multidirectional patterns of change, and emergent properties’’ ([<a href="#R74">74</a>], pp.&nbsp;530-531). As we emerge from COVID-19, we face an urgent task of framing securitization
                                 for a more holistically understood and sustainable planet. This challenge centres
                                 on effecting a vision for a more-than-human sense of security that signals overlapping
                                 human and environmental concerns, stresses global interconnectedness and the need
                                 for global solidarity, and ultimately offers a framework for securitization that supersedes
                                 unilateralism and exceptionalism by seeing human and environmental precarity as conjoined
                                 and existing beyond borders.

                              <p id="d1e468">In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, have we reached a tipping point in thinking
                                 productively and responsibly about planetary precarity? Up until now, we have been
                                 living a capitalist fable in many ways. It is clear now that the excessive consumerist
                                 conceit of late modern capitalism was always biologically unsustainable, and this
                                 has been shown to have been economically unstable too. Now is the time for brave and
                                 principled leadership, and not for environmental and political-economic denial, misinformation
                                 strategies, and tacit support for powerful corporate interests [<a href="#R75">75</a>, <a href="#R76">76</a>, <a href="#R77">77</a>]. As Mike Davis imploringly reasons, we need ‘‘effective responses to present and
                                 future plagues, ones that mobilize popular courage, give leadership to science, and
                                 use the resources of a comprehensive system of universal health coverage and public
                                 medicine’’ [<a href="#R78">78</a>].

                              <p id="d1e482">In different ways, like Vladimir and Estragon in Samuel Beckett’s <i>Waiting for Godot</i>, we are all waiting now, waiting and hoping for a safer world, and it is not just
                                 the destitute, the poor, the hungry, the marginalized, the out of view. While we wait,
                                 we must agitate for a deeper appreciation of planetary precarity and global interconnectedness
                                 to emerge from COVID-19. Global solidarity and collective responsibility for safeguarding
                                 the future is more important now than ever before. In strategizing for this critical
                                 task, convincingly framing a more-than-human sense of security is vital to establishing
                                 a path towards a healthier and more sustainable planet.
