                                 that while the concept of COP holds promise of representing a more sustainable approach
                                 to conventional post-conflict police reform, among our cases, there are limited examples
                                 of successful COP. Rather, our cases reveal that COP is often perceived as much as
                                 a surveillance tool to legitimise harsh policing tactics, as promoting human security
                                 or serious reforms. The more robust finding, unsurprisningly, is that the levels of
                                 trust between the police and communities, and thus the viability of COP, is closely
                                 linked to whether the police act more as a service or a force. While the principles
                                 of COP are connected to a police service, in the ideal-typical sense, the post-conflict
                                 cases we have analysed are closer to the ideal-typical police force. A number of challenges
                                 and what seem to make COP more viable across cases are identified, which should be
                                 taken into account when COP is implemented in societies where a police force is the
                                 predominiant way of policing. &nbsp;</span></div>

                              <p id="d1e92">Substantial resources have been allocated to international police reform in fragile
                                 and post-conflict states [<a href="#R1">1</a>, <a href="#R2">2</a>, <a href="#R3">3</a>, <a href="#R4">4</a>, <a href="#R5">5</a>, <a href="#R6">6</a>, <a href="#R7">7</a>, <a href="#R8">8</a>, <a href="#R9">9</a>]. The theory of change underlying this, has been an understanding that for social
                                 and economic change to occur, the rule of law must also change, and that reforming
                                 the police to become more accountable and transparent is a step in that direction
                                 [<a href="#R10">10</a>]. These contexts are extremely challenging and conventional police-reform approaches
                                 have proven difficult and, in some cases, unsustainable [<a href="#R11">11</a>]. In response, community-oriented policing (COP) is lauded as an alternative approach,
                                 perceived to enhance the sustainability and effectiveness of policing, emerging from
                                 a realization that the police cannot work alone. Compared to conventional policing,
                                 COP is more attentive to local communities; focussing on joint problem-solving, partnerships
                                 and prevention; and is more in accord with the concept of human security. In its 1994
                                 Human Development Report, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) identified
                                 seven core elements that together constitute the concept of human security: economic
                                 security; food security; health security; environmental security; personal security;
                                 community security; and political security [<a href="#R12">12</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e132">COP is defined and practiced differently by various stakeholders within and between
                                 countries. Whereas some treat it as a surveillance mechanism, enabling the police
                                 to gather information about community members, others see it as a philosophy or a
                                 method whereby the police and community cooperate with the aim of increasing the latter’s
                                 security [<a href="#R13">13</a>]. Based on an understanding that community problems require community-engaged solutions
                                 and support, the UN defines COP as <i>‘‘A strategy for encouraging the public to act as partners with the police in preventing
                                    and managing crime as well as other aspects of security and order based on the needs
                                    of the community.’’</i> [<a href="#R14">14</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e143">The UN has set out four cornerstones of COP: 1) consulting with communities; 2) responding
                                 to communities; 3) mobilising communities; and 4) solving recurring problems. The
                                 UN has also identified several benefits of COP in conflict or post-conflict settings.
                                 Most importantly, it is suggested that a more consultative approach to policing will
                                 allow the community to have more trust in the police, which in turn will lead to crime
                                 prevention, information sharing, advance warning and build community resilience [<a href="#R14">14</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e148">In line with much of the thinking on international policing ‘‘abroad’’, COP emerged
                                 in the US in the 1970s. The concept gained traction from the early 1990s onwards,
                                 in parallel with an increase in security studies critical of the state-centric, militarised
                                 national security paradigm that was then hegemonic in policy and academic circles
                                 ([<a href="#R15">15</a>], p.&nbsp;79). A realization that local knowledge was a neglected resource in policing,
                                 formed the basis for COP ([<a href="#R16">16</a>], pp.&nbsp;25-26). However, also COP has been subject to much of the same criticism as
                                 other types of police reform initiated by external actors (such as the UN, the EU,
                                 the OSCE or the AU), and in particular that it ignores existing local practices, legal
                                 pluralism and proves to be irrelevant for the communities in question ([<a href="#R10">10</a>], p.&nbsp;88). Nontheless, while national and international police reform processes have
                                 mainly focused on capital and larger cities, and hence ignored local communities,
                                 there are a number of places where community-initiated security arrangements are in
                                 evidence. These local practices are either supplementing the work of the police as
                                 part of formal COP initiatives or offering an alternative to state dysfunction. There
                                 is, however, little research on how COP is understood and practiced across post-conflict
                                 countries, which makes it more difficult to detect whether or when COP works.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e159">In this article, we aim to contribute with knowledge that can support future police
                                 reform and the implementation of COP intitiatives, by providing an analysis of patterns
                                 of similarities and differences across 12 post-conflict cases, allowing for identification
                                 of practices that both challenge and render COP more viable. In doing so, we draw
                                 on findings from Afghanistan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, El Salvador, Guatemala, Kenya,
                                 Kosovo, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Serbia, Somalia, Somaliland and Uganda. The methodology
                                 of this article echos the methodological approach in the research project, from which
                                 this article presents findings across cases. The main focus of the project was to
                                 understand whether and how community-oriented policing could provide a way forward
                                 to improve human security in post-conflict areas. The cases were selected according
                                 to a number of criteria: relevance to the international engagement in police missions;
                                 relevance of the cases to the history and development of COP, reflecting both success
                                 stories and worst-case scenarios; in addition to these cases spanning across four

                              <p id="d1e161">The around 35 researchers involved in the project come from various scholarly disciplines,
                                 including anthropology, development studies, law, criminology, political science,
                                 and technology. A qualitative approach was applied, including in-depth interviews,
                                 focus groups and participant observations to study various community-oriented policing
                                 practices. The data were gathered between 2016 and 2019. Interviewees and focus group
                                 participants came from national, regional, and local government authorities, state
                                 and local police units, national and international non-governmental organisations
                                 (NGOs), representatives from the UN and EU, and local communities in case countries.
                                 Within communities, particular emphasis was placed on including representatives of
                                 varying ages and genders, from different socio-economic standings, rural and urban
                                 areas. The project also included a Policing Experts Network (PEN) of around 40 police
                                 officers and police experts, whose role was to support research planning and the dissemination
                                 of findings, as well as to ensure the research was grounded in police practice. Researchers
                                 and PEN members met at least once a year over a period of five, in order to discuss
                                 preliminary findings in each case and across-cases analysis.

                              <p id="d1e163">Research involving qualitative data, collected by a number of researchers from several
                                 different disciplines, can represent a challenge for cohesive analysis [<a href="#R17">17</a>]. Combining in-depth case studies with comparative research is also a potential challenge
                                 [<a href="#R18">18</a>]. To overcome these methodological challenges, several strategies were applied. First
                                 of all, based on discussions among researchers, Quality Control and Coherence Reports
                                 were written, where all researchers were asked to contribute with reflections on how
                                 to overcome this, which in itself was a way to increase attention [<a href="#R18">18</a>]. Second, following fieldwork and desk research, findings were systematised and gathered
                                 into a ‘‘matrix’’, whereby responses to nine main research questions and a number
                                 of sub-questions were sorted according to cases and with particular emphasis given
                                 to youth and gender. The purpose of the matrix was two-fold: to serve as a tool to
                                 discuss emerging findings within and between cases, and to compare and contrast findings.
                                 It was a living document, updated continually as more and better data was obtained.
                                 A guideline for how to use the matrix was developed. The matrix as well as annual
                                 meetings provided a framework in which project members could identify commonalities
                                 and discontinuities, between and within cases. Finally, when the researchers gathered
                                 regularily to discuss similarities and differences between cases, we used the anthropological
                                 concepts of <i>emic</i> and <i>etic</i>, as an analytical starting point [<a href="#R19">19</a>]. While <i>emic</i> refers to the uniqueness of a particular case, for instance how family is organized
                                 in a particular society, <i>etic</i> refers to the concept of family, without contextualization. By using <i>emic</i> lenses, we discussed the complexity of each case, while by using the <i>etic</i> lenses, we discovered how practices, challenges and vulnerabilities had similarities
                                 across cases [<a href="#R18">18</a>].

                              <p id="d1e199">This article is based on the matrix, discussions in workshops, interviews with individual
                                 researchers as well as the published articles of the project. Given the contextual
                                 differences between the cases, is not feasible to <i>strictly</i> compare the cases to one another in the sense of reaching generalizable findings.
                                 Rather, our aim is to look for <i>patterns of similarities</i> and differences in the etic understanding, treating COP as a category of practice.

                              <p id="d1e207">The structure of the article is as follows. First, we present an ideal-typical model
                                 of policing, which will serve as an analytical framework in the first part. Here,
                                 we apply a deductive methodology, exploring the historical trajectories of each case,
                                 including perceptions of policing and trust between the community and police. We then
                                 turn to a more inductive approach, when we zoom in and examine first challenges facing
                                 practices of COP, before analysing case study examples of what appears to make COP
                                 more viable. Finally, we offer some concluding remarks.

                              <p id="d1e212">While a number of definitions on policing exist, their core is on public order, including
                                 preventing and detecting crime [<a href="#R16">16</a>, <a href="#R20">20</a>, <a href="#R21">21</a>, <a href="#R22">22</a>, <a href="#R23">23</a>, <a href="#R24">24</a>]. In looking at ideal-typical extremes on a continuum, in the Weberian understanding
                                 of ideal-types [<a href="#R25">25</a>], the police can be sorted into those that are seen to serve the people (a police
                                 <i>service</i>) and those that protect the interests of the state (a police <i>force</i>) [<a href="#R26">26</a>, <a href="#R27">27</a>]. These two types can be ascribed a number of characteristics, as seen in Figure
                                 <a href="#Fig1">1</a>.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e252">The police can also be perceived as a <i>projector</i> of power and/or a tool of power [<a href="#R8">8</a>]. As a projector of power, the police – through its practices – empowers groups and
                                 individuals, with intended and unintended consequences. As such, police reform is
                                 a highly political process, interfering with and challenging the state’s instrument
                                 of power ([<a href="#R11">11</a>], p.&nbsp;14).
                                 
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e263">Similarly, power forms part of the equation when external actors assist in reforming
                                 the police in post-conflict settings, which may have the (unintended) consequence
                                 of strengthening a corrupt, illegitimate regime. If the police are viewed as protector
                                 of the regime and provider of unjust treatment, grievances within the community are
                                 more likely to translate into violent action [<a href="#R28">28</a>], or the community may seek protection from alternative security providers [<a href="#R29">29</a>]. Thus, while the intention of actors such as the UN and the EU is to facilitate
                                 reform that result in a more accountable, transparent and civilian police, the effect
                                 may in such situations be the opposite. Another point of caution in this regard is
                                 that even in cases where citizen priorities are promoted, one might end up promoting
                                 only the interests of the socio-economic elite rather than the wider community ([<a href="#R30">30</a>], p.&nbsp;636). Within criminology, a growing body of critical literature has focused
                                 on how what was originally a US approach to crime fighting has influenced international
                                 police reform approaches in contexts that are very different to the intended landscape
                                 [<a href="#R31">31</a>, <a href="#R32">32</a>, <a href="#R33">33</a>, <a href="#R34">34</a>, <a href="#R35">35</a>, <a href="#R36">36</a>, <a href="#R37">37</a>]. This ‘‘exported’’ understanding of crimefighting, which lacks sensitivity and adaptation
                                 towards local context, is probably one of the main reasons behind the challenges of
                                 sustainability when it comes to international police reform. Another main reason that
                                 may explain why police reform is difficult when it comes to community–police relations,
                                 is lack of trust.

                              <p id="d1e303">Previous studies indicate that people’s trust in the police is closely related to
                                 whether they perceive the police as legitimate and accountable [<a href="#R38">38</a>, <a href="#R39">39</a>, <a href="#R40">40</a>, <a href="#R41">41</a>, <a href="#R42">42</a>]; in particular downwards to the public [<a href="#R10">10</a>, <a href="#R43">43</a>]; and as efficient [<a href="#R44">44</a>]. While recognizing this, in the following we focus more narrowly on the concept
                                 of trust and how it is intertwined with the sense of the social contract between a
                                 state and its citizens [<a href="#R16">16</a>, <a href="#R45">45</a>]. Trust in the police correlates with people’s trust in government [<a href="#R46">46</a>, <a href="#R47">47</a>, <a href="#R48">48</a>]. In many post-conflict countries, the relationship between the police and communities
                                 is characterised by deep distrust. The literature indicates that this is primarily
                                 because the police are serving the interests of the ruling elite, and in doing so
                                 oppressing the population through its practices [<a href="#R49">49</a>, <a href="#R50">50</a>]. Hence, people’s trust in the police cannot be understood without looking at both
                                 historical and contemporary practices [<a href="#R51">51</a>]. Additionally, it is important to remember that not only may people lack trust in
                                 the police – the police in turn may feel threatened by or suspicious of communities,
                                 undermining community–police cooperation. Discussing the advantages of a community-oriented
                                 approach to policing in Western countries, Bayley ([<a href="#R52">52</a>], p.&nbsp;15) argues that, ‘‘community-oriented policing is the only strategy that begins
                                 to meet the major fear that is in the minds of the police … namely collective violence
                                 by disadvantaged groups’’, as it ‘‘allows the police to reach into those communities
                                 and to do something ameliorative and helpful, to build bridges before the only response
                                 these people have to conditions of modern life is violence’’. However, the police
                                 are seldom the main provider of security in fragile and post-conflict states: ‘‘Local
                                 gangs, militias and criminal networks, neighbourhood strongmen, insurgency groups,
                                 elderly councils, chiefs and religious leaders and institutions all contribute to
                                 make the field of security messier and can both be those that represent insecurity
                                 for people and or play the role as non-state security providers’’ [<a href="#R53">53</a>]. Non-state security providers and institutions may be deemed legitimate based on
                                 tradition or custom, and as such, may be regarded as more legitimate than the police.
                                 In addition, while institutions may be perceived as legitimate, they may not be trusted.

                              <p id="d1e367">The South East European cases – Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Kosovo – share
                                 similar histories, having been part of communist Yugoslavia before experiencing ethnic
                                 conflict in the wake of the country’s dissolution in the early 1990s. Under Yugoslavia’s
                                 communist leader Josef Broz Tito, these states had experienced elements of community
                                 policing in the form of the concept of self-protection [<a href="#R54">54</a>, <a href="#R55">55</a>]. During this era, the police focused on fostering joint police–public activities.
                                 However, with the outbreak of violent conflict in 1991 and 1992, the police protected
                                 the regime, resulting in a more repressive form of policing [<a href="#R54">54</a>]. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, which gained independence under the Dayton Agreement
                                 of 1995, the international community – led by the UN Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovinian
                                 (UNMBiH) – had a significant impact on police and security sector reform [<a href="#R55">55</a>]. COP initiatives were an important element of the reform process, with the International
                                 Police Task Force (IPTF) organising relevant training courses. COP was further formalised
                                 in 2007 when Bosnia and Herzegovina’s Ministry of Security adopted the Strategy for
                                 Community-Based Policing [<a href="#R55">55</a>]. In 1999, following NATO’s bombing campaign, Kosovo was placed under UN administration
                                 (UNSC Resolution 1244). Since then, the Organization for Security and Cooperation
                                 in Europe (OSCE) Mission to Kosovo has been the main international actor engaged in
                                 police reform in the country. Consequently, understandings of COP accord with the
                                 OSCE’s understanding of the concept. In 2008, Kosovo unilaterally declared independence
                                 from Serbia, and the following year, Municipal Community Councils were established.
                                 These aimed at addressing community security by involving mayors, police, religious
                                 and ethnic communities, and civil society [<a href="#R54">54</a>]. COP was further formalised through a set of handbooks, strategies and action plans,
                                 such as the Community Policing Strategy and Action Plan of 2012–2016 [<a href="#R54">54</a>].

                                 the country from the 1960s onwards; while in El Salvador, civil war raged from 1979
                                 to 1992 following the fall of the dictatorship ([<a href="#R60">60</a>], p.&nbsp;2). In Nicaragua, a COP model had already been established in 1979 following
                                 the socialist Sandinista revolution. The national police have, in part through the
                                 Integrated Police–Community Policy in place since 2001, enhanced this focus by introducing
                                 a range of initiatives aimed at strengthening community–police relations [<a href="#R57">57</a>]. In order to maintain links between the police and the community, personnel are
                                 trained in a number of issues, including the legal code for children and youth; intra-family
                                 violence; gender; and citizen security. Moreover, home visits are common ([<a href="#R57">57</a>], p.&nbsp;10). Despite Nicaragua being the second poorest state in the region, crime rates
                                 have been relatively low, and community–police trust has been characterised as high.
                                 Following the authoritarian shift in government in 2018, Nicaragua has experienced
                                 more widespread violence, which it may be assumed has been accompanied by a decrease
                                 in the level of trust between the police and communities [<a href="#R57">57</a>, <a href="#R61">61</a>]. As part of the return to democratic rule in El Salvador and Guatemala, and the
                                 signing of peace accords in, respectively, 1993 and 1996, new civilian police forces
                                 were established [<a href="#R57">57</a>]. In El Salvador, Community Police Intervention Patrols (PIP-COM) operated between
                                 1994-2004, with the aim of reducing crime through community integration and consultation,
                                 yet with limited success ([<a href="#R58">58</a>], p.&nbsp;75). Official documents issued by the government and the National Civil Police
                                 (PNC) identifies community policing as the central model for police activity, and
                                 a majority of police officers have been trained in community policing philosophy.
                                 Moreover, in 2015, El Salvador’s National Council on Citizen Security launched a comprehensive
                                 ten-year plan aimed at strengthening institutions responsible for human security [<a href="#R62">62</a>]. Despite these efforts, a grounded community approach has not been realised, with
                                 El Salvador remaining one of the most violent countries in the world, leading in turn
                                 to a militarised and brutalising police approach [<a href="#R58">58</a>]. Finally, Guatemala has made efforts towards a COP model, as evidenced by the establishment
                                 of the Community Security Police Model (MOPSIC) in 2014 [<a href="#R63">63</a>]. MOPSIC is designed to promote a community philosophy among the police, thereby
                                 improving police services and building trust with communities. While the MOPSIC is
                                 well-established in Guatemala, there are several barriers to its success, including
                                 a lack of clarity on the fundamental concepts of COP [<a href="#R63">63</a>].

                              <p id="d1e440">As for the African cases, Kenya has faced decades of ethnic violence and, more recently,
                                 terrorist attacks ([<a href="#R60">60</a>], p.&nbsp;2); Somalia’s federal government only formed in 2012 and the country continues
                                 to struggle with domestic terrorism; while until 2008 Uganda experienced conflict
                                 in the Acholi districts in the country’s north [<a href="#R64">64</a>, <a href="#R65">65</a>]. Though COP was not a new concept in Kenya, with several state and non-state actors
                                 having introduced related programmes over the years, community-oriented policing was
                                 formally introduced in 2005 [<a href="#R66">66</a>]. With the constitutional reform in 2010, the concept of COP was further developed
                                 and the objectives of COP are stated in a number of key documents, including the National
                                 Police Act and the National Police Service Standing Order (IMG Police Reform) [<a href="#R66">66</a>]. Two parallel and contested COP models have been developed: Nyumba Kumi (‘‘Ten Households’’),
                                 led by the President’s Office; and the National Police Services (NPS) Community Policing
                                 Structure (CPC) structure [<a href="#R66">66</a>]. In the Nyumba Kumi COP model, ten households are represented by a single individual,
                                 who serves as a liaison between the police and the community [<a href="#R66">66</a>]. In Somalia, there are locally developed versions of COP, but these typically have
                                 more in common with widespread, locally-based neighbourhood watch schemes, and are
                                 usually clan based [<a href="#R67">67</a>]. Nonetheless, the African Union Mission on Somalia (AMISOM) and donors in Jubaland
                                 have made attempts at introducing community policing initiatives [<a href="#R64">64</a>]. In Uganda, community policing was imported in the 1990s by the UK’s Department
                                 for International Development (DFID), in an effort to bring police officers and the
                                 community closer together [<a href="#R68">68</a>]. Community policing is today a formal policy, its latest iteration introduced by
                                 President Museveni in 2014. While a COP-like policing has existed in some form since
                                 Uganda’s independent, ‘‘there have been few modern innovations’’, but rather a continuation
                                 of the past concepts and with a focus on creating awareness about law and order [<a href="#R65">65</a>].

                              <p id="d1e476">Finally, in the South Asian cases, Pakistan has experienced armed conflict in the
                                 Swat Valley (2009) and unrest in the border areas with Afghanistan; while Afghanistan
                                 experienced civil war in 1978–1979 as well as several foreign occupations and interventions
                                 ([<a href="#R60">60</a>], p.&nbsp;2). When the international community intervened in Afghanistan in 2001, trust
                                 between the community and the police were largely non-existent. Interest in COP increased
                                 in 2009, with pilot projects introduced to Afghanistan’s Ministry of Interior Affairs
                                 (MoIA) by European Union Police Mission in Afghanistan (EUPOL) and United Nations
                                 Office for Project Service (UNOPS) ([<a href="#R69">69</a>], p.&nbsp;58). However, a number of years prior to this, enormous external resources had
                                 been put into efforts such as training police officers and changing curricula in order
                                 to promote more civilian and service-oriented police. These resources were provided
                                 by, among other countries, Canada, Germany and Norway, through bilateral agreements
                                 and coordinating mechanisms such as the International Police Coordinating Board (IPCB)
                                 [<a href="#R69">69</a>, <a href="#R70">70</a>]. In 2012, the Police e Mardumi (community policing) Secretariat was officially inaugurated
                                 in the MoIA. This focus is emphasised in the MoIA’s Ten-Year Vision for Afghan National
                                 Police (2014–2024). COP efforts are also visible at the provincial and district level,
                                 where police have been trained in and have implemented various COP initiatives [<a href="#R69">69</a>]. Despite the challenging context, the Afghan police have come a long way in moving
                                 beyond policy and speech to practice. Furthermore, while there was an external push
                                 towards implementing a COP approach, Nyborg, Ganapathy and Nimruzi [<a href="#R69">69</a>], argue that how ‘‘COP was implemented through linking with local institutions and
                                 civil society actors went a long way in making COP a locally-owned process addressing
                                 the diverse and complex needs of Afghan women and men’’. In Pakistan, as in other
                                 case countries, there is no single definition of community policing. While COP has
                                 formally been implemented in many regions, different models have been adopted ([<a href="#R71">71</a>], p.&nbsp;25). Following periods of conflict, a number of hybrid ‘‘institutions have emerged,
                                 initiated by both government and communities, with varying degrees of success in building
                                 trust and addressing peoples’ fears that militants may return’’ [<a href="#R72">72</a>]. There are, however, several promising COP initiatives at the regional level, for
                                 instance in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, which was the worst-affected province in Pakistan
                                 post 9/11, with terrorism, kidnappings and threats of violence leading to high levels
                                 of fear among the public ([<a href="#R73">73</a>], p.&nbsp;41). There, Public Liaison Committees (PLCs) were established, aimed at fostering
                                 improved community–police relations. Another initiative in the same region is the
                                 Dispute Resolution Councils (DRCs) [<a href="#R74">74</a>]. Despite slow progress, several reform efforts have been undertaken to improve law
                                 enforcement agencies. According to a study by Nawab et al. ([<a href="#R73">73</a>], p.&nbsp;41), most of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government’s more recent initiatives ‘‘are
                                 in the spirit of community-oriented policing, and community members see visible improvement
                                 in policing and community–police relations’’.

                              <p id="d1e512">Here we have learned that while there are examples of a more service-oriented police
                                 historically, most of our post-conflict cases fall within a force-oriented police
                                 force (according to Figure <a href="#Fig1">1</a>). In the following sections, we turn to a more inductive methodological approach,
                                 first exploring perceived challenges to COP in our cases, then exploring good practices
                                 of COP.

                              <p id="d1e520">Findings from the 12 cases suggest that the absence of trust between communities and
                                 the police – an inherent challenge to effective community policing – is often ascribed
                                 to the former’s perception of the latter as a force, set up to serve a small ruling
                                 elite and protect the government and politicians, rather than provide citizens with
                                 security. Widespread corruption and nepotism aimed at facilitating personal gain by
                                 police officers are also reported as critical concerns across cases, though it is
                                 recognised in several case countries that the police are poorly paid (if, indeed,
                                 they are paid at all).
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e522">Field research in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2016 and 2018, as well as in Kosovo in
                                 2018, reveals that the perception of the police as a force is reinforced by a belief
                                 that they lack the capability and capacity to detect/deter crime, and by a perception
                                 that politicians lack interest in citizen’s needs [<a href="#R56">56</a>, <a href="#R75">75</a>]. By way of illustration, during a focus group study of youth in Kosovo, one respondent
                                 stated that ‘‘If I heard about more cases where the police succeeded, and they’d done
                                 their job, then I’d be more trustful. But that’s not the case’’ ([<a href="#R75">75</a>], p.&nbsp;2). Similarly, in Bosnia, lack of vertical accountability and the politicised
                                 nature of the police, coupled with a lack of resources, stand out as major challenges
                                 [<a href="#R56">56</a>]. Similar challenges and perceptions of the police were found during fieldwork conducted
                                 in Kenya by Gjelsvik in January 2016 and May 2018 [<a href="#R66">66</a>]. A common view among Kenyans is that the police protect the government and politicians,
                                 rather than citizens [<a href="#R66">66</a>, <a href="#R76">76</a>]. In fact, Gjelsvik ([<a href="#R66">66</a>], p.&nbsp;28) notes that ‘‘Powerholders have little to gain if the police forces are transformed
                                 into a truly people-centred, democratic and accountable system’’, thus hampering the
                                 implementation of COP. Lack of trust in the police also stems from the justice system’s
                                 limited response and unreliable nature, as well as a lack of police confidentiality,
                                 meaning that many Kenyans are reluctant to share information [<a href="#R66">66</a>, <a href="#R77">77</a>]. This in turn contributes to less effective policing, illustrated by the lack of
                                 willingness of citizens to testify in courts [<a href="#R66">66</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e558">Across our cases, another identified challenge to effective community policing is
                                 the often-militarised nature of the police [<a href="#R58">58</a>, <a href="#R76">76</a>, <a href="#R77">77</a>]. In some instances, a more militarised policing style is tied to the presence of
                                 non-state armed fractions, such as al-Shabaab in Somalia [<a href="#R64">64</a>]. In Somalia, this has led to the prioritization of physical security rather than
                                 human security concerns, if the police is present at all [<a href="#R64">64</a>]. In a related manner, Lid and Okwany [<a href="#R77">77</a>] find that while ‘‘people-centred policing’’ is a buzzword for Kenyan police reform
                                 the threat of terrorism and violent extremism has led the Kenyan government to apply
                                 COP more as a surveillance and intelligence-gathering tool, rather than focusing on
                                 partnership, problem solving and people-centred policing [<a href="#R77">77</a>]. Notably, the COP model Nyumba Kumi (‘‘Ten Households’’), was initiated by the government
                                 shortly after the terrorisk attack at Nairobis Westgate Centre in 2013 [<a href="#R77">77</a>]. Hence, the implementation of the Nyumba Kumi intitative was motivated by the need
                                 to strenghten community-police communcation and intelligence gathering ([<a href="#R77">77</a>], p.&nbsp;49). The governments focus on intelligence gathering rather than community concerns,
                                 affected how the community viewed the Nyumba Kumi, and partly explains the resistance
                                 towards the initiative [<a href="#R66">66</a>, <a href="#R77">77</a>]. Gjelsvik ([<a href="#R66">66</a>], p.&nbsp;23) finds that many Kenyans are sceptical of this set-up, with a representative
                                 of a Mombasa human rights organisation explaining, ‘‘They created a new structure
                                 that was very foreign to people. For many it felt like spying on your neighbours …
                                 it rather needs to be a community-driven initiative and owned by the community. It
                                 also needs to be based on the need of the community and the community demands’’.

                              <p id="d1e598">Importantly, the case study demonstrates that levels of trust between the community
                                 and the police, as well as the perceptions of COP, differ according to who you ask
                                 [<a href="#R78">78</a>]. With regard to the Nyumba Kumi initiative, Lid and Okwany ([<a href="#R77">77</a>], p.&nbsp;51) find that, ‘‘persons of other ethnic and/or political affiliation than the
                                 ruling party are particularly skeptical to NK, which they see as an instrument for
                                 intelligence gathering’’, suggesting that COP in Kenya tends to reproduce existing
                                 power structures. Similarly, Gjelsvik [<a href="#R78">78</a>] found that in Muslim-dominated and economically less well-established, community-members
                                 – especially youth- report that they are unlawfully targeted. This has contributed
                                 to more resentment among groups that were already neglected by the government [<a href="#R78">78</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e612">In El Salvador, heavy-handed and repressive policing has become the norm rather than
                                 the exception, partly due to increasing crime levels and partly due to a right-wing
                                 dominated executive branch of government [<a href="#R58">58</a>]. The militarized nature of the police was further enhanced in 2016, with the formation
                                 of a Special Force division, enabling the police to conduct joint operations alongside
                                 military forces to fight criminal gangs [<a href="#R62">62</a>]. Following the formation of the Special Force division, there was an increase in
                                 extra-judicial killings of alleged gang members and an increase in the number of women
                                 killed [<a href="#R58">58</a>]. Notably, in El Salvador, repressive police strategies are not related solely to
                                 the threat of violent extremism or the fight against criminal gangs, but are a structural
                                 issue. Field research in El Salvador indicated that there is a cultural resistance
                                 against the COP model within the police [<a href="#R58">58</a>]. By way of illustration, during interviews undertaken by Rojas Ospina in San Salvador,
                                 a police officer noted that COP ‘‘often render as something negative within the police
                                 and is perceived as a form of ‘sissy’ or soft policing’’ ([<a href="#R58">58</a>], p.&nbsp;76). In another interview conducted by Rojas Ospina, a police agent stated that
                                 ‘‘what you learn in the academy is theoretical and there is no use for it in the streets’’,
                                 indicating that effective policing is not aligned with community-oriented policing
                                 ([<a href="#R58">58</a>], p.&nbsp;76). Hence, as the police continue to use repression to fight crime COP is not
                                 rooted locally [<a href="#R58">58</a>]. The tendency towards brutal, top-down policing found in El Salvador and Kenya is
                                 also becoming a challenge to COP and good community–police relations in Nicaragua.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e636">Among the cases examined here, Nicaragua is reported as one of the more successful
                                 cases when it comes to local ownership of COP [<a href="#R57">57</a>, <a href="#R58">58</a>, <a href="#R59">59</a>, <a href="#R60">60</a>]. Levels of trust between the police and communities have been characterised as high
                                 compared to other countries in Central America, including El Salvador and Guatemala.
                                 This is largely attributed to the country’s well-regarded police force, which utilises
                                 a grassroots (bottom-up) approach to policing [<a href="#R57">57</a>]. This approach has been described as friendlier and less repressive than that employed
                                 by other countries in the region, and the police have attached great importance to
                                 the pillars of ‘‘outreach, accessibility and accountability’’ ([<a href="#R57">57</a>], p.&nbsp;8). Despite these positive developments, increasing violence and a more authoritarian
                                 shift in the government since 2018 have hurt community–police relations [<a href="#R57">57</a>]. On top of this, there has been a shift to a more centralised policing model and
                                 COP system, which includes responsibility for youth programmes and community sports
                                 programmes being transferred from the police to other government institutions. Interview
                                 respondents, including ex-police chiefs, commented that ‘‘this move was short-sighted
                                 given its effect on community policing and the effective flow of information regarding
                                 local conditions of insecurity’’ ([<a href="#R57">57</a>], p.&nbsp;25). Moreover, in interviews carried out in 2017, analysts and ex-officials
                                 pointed to falling confidence in the police as a consequence of the more centralised
                                 policing model ([<a href="#R57">57</a>], p.&nbsp;24). A similar challenge was noted in the case of Kenya. During fieldwork (2018–2019),
                                 Gjelsvik found that local stakeholders, communities and citizens appear to have had
                                 little influence in developing COP structures, and many consider it a top-down model
                                 forced on them by the state. Added to this is the way in which COP is commonly understood
                                 and practiced at the local level, which in several places equates to ‘‘vigilantism,
                                 coercion or extortion, a replacement for village elders, spy rings, a parallel security
                                 system, political forums, and other outfit that contravenes the law’’ ([<a href="#R66">66</a>], p.&nbsp;23). This form of ‘‘high-jacking’’ is yet another challenge to COP, also identified
                                 in El Salvador [<a href="#R62">62</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e672">Looking at COP across cases, it appears that meaningful implementation is challenged
                                 by the police’s failure to act as a service to the community. In several instances,
                                 this tendency is reinforced by repressive and brutal police tactics, as can be seen
                                 in El Salvador, and community perceptions of COP as being externally enforced, as
                                 can be seen in Kenya. Meaningful implementation of COP is also challenged by the various
                                 (state and non-state) security providers present, whether they are perceived as legitimate
                                 or not. Examples of this can be seen across cases, including respondents expressing
                                 a fear of retaliation from gang members (for instance, in El Salvador and Colombia)
                                 or insurgency groups (for instance, in Afghanistan and Somalia), with cooperation
                                 with police regarded as an act of disloyalty or an admission that an individual is
                                 an ‘‘enemy of the gangs’’. Being labelled a ‘‘police informer’’ can have lethal consequences.
                                 Police also contribute to this fear by taking bribes in return for revealing the identity
                                 of individuals who report cases, putting them at risk of reprisals. Making complaints
                                 against the police or advocating for police accountability in COP forums may be equally
                                 risky. As one former member of the Nyumba Kumi initiative in Kenya noted, ‘‘you are
                                 not allowed to say anything against the police. They are ‘small Gods’. If you complain
                                 they give out your details, and it becomes a risk for you’’ ([<a href="#R66">66</a>], p.&nbsp;23).

                              <p id="d1e680">Despite the challenges associated with community policing, our cases also demonstrate
                                 what can be achieved by a more people-centred policing strategy, and the conditions
                                 under which this is feasible. As the Nicaraguan case illustrates, the decentralised
                                 nature of the Nicaraguan National Police (PNN) has, until recently, been key to its
                                 success [<a href="#R57">57</a>]. Relatedly, another important factor – identified by Hills [<a href="#R79">79</a>] in the Kenya case study – is the attitude and behaviour of local police, which is
                                 crucial when it comes to how communities perceive or welcome COP initiatives. Conducting
                                 field research on three Nairobi police stations, Hills [<a href="#R79">79</a>] found that station commanders had proactively sought improved relations between
                                 officers and the local community. As part of an annual police competition conducted
                                 by the Kenyan Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA), a station at Athi River,
                                 south of Nairobi, won best operational community policing initiative, as ‘‘It fulfilled
                                 the competitions criteria by providing evidence of a thoughtful and structured approach
                                 to community policing, careful record keeping, and most importantly the commanders’
                                 provision of leadership to both police and the community’’ ([<a href="#R79">79</a>], p.&nbsp;1). This example lends supports to one respondent’s argument that the place
                                 to effect change should be at the station, bearing in mind that it is the point at
                                 which the public meets the police [<a href="#R79">79</a>]. Importantly, these findings are not unique to Kenya, but point to a lesson applicable
                                 across cases.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e697">In El Salvador, a major challenge to COP comes from within the police force, as well
                                 as the fact that many people are reluctant to cooperate with the police [<a href="#R58">58</a>]. A recent study on perceptions of police in El Salvador [<a href="#R80">80</a>] found that those in neighbourhoods with a systematic implementation of COP are more
                                 afraid of the police compared to those in neighbourhoods where COP is not implemented.
                                 Yet, the same study also found that ‘‘people are more inclined to trust the police
                                 officer that is present in the neighbourhood and conducts constant patrols and thereby
                                 interacts with the community’’ ([<a href="#R80">80</a>], p.&nbsp;84). These contradictory findings highlight that it is the quality of the presence
                                 and interaction with the community that is important, and moreover, that trust in
                                 the police is linked to the spirit of their work within the community. Perhaps, as
                                 Hills [<a href="#R79">79</a>] describes, in some instances it is the police officers themselves who matter more
                                 than the policing model. A clear example of this was identified by Rojas Ospina [<a href="#R58">58</a>] during a March 2018 field visit to a rural community in Cabanas. The visit took
                                 place following the eruption of a spiral of violence, which had prompted the police
                                 to interfere in order to maintain order and stabilise the situation. The police’s
                                 initial strategy was to go from door to door to gain information, but they faced mistrust
                                 from the community. The police then approached youth and kids at the local football
                                 field and provided them with support by guarding their games and football tournaments,
                                 thereby earning their trust ([<a href="#R58">58</a>], p.&nbsp;78). Eventually, the police also gained the trust of the youth’s parents and
                                 the wider community. According to community members, this was possible because ‘‘the
                                 police stayed in the community and got to know the people that lived there, especially
                                 the youth’’ ([<a href="#R58">58</a>], p.&nbsp;78).
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e721">The importance of police officers’ presence in a community was also observed by McNeish,
                                 Martinez Prado and Frühling Ehrlich [<a href="#R57">57</a>] in the case of Nicaragua. They argue that a critical element explaining good community–police
                                 relations is that community police officers (<i>jefes de sector</i>) often live in and patrol the same community. By participating in meetings with residents,
                                 police officers have created close ties with community members ([<a href="#R57">57</a>], p.&nbsp;12). Another example from Nicaragua is the Social Prevention of Crime Committees,
                                 which organises assemblies and works with local institutions to solve security issues.
                                 These assemblies have given the police, at least until recently, a profound insight
                                 into the drivers of insecurity [<a href="#R57">57</a>]. Conversely, in Somaliland, Hills [<a href="#R81">81</a>] found that even residents living near a police station value neighbourhood watch
                                 groups and community groups over the police. One reason for this is that these groups
                                 are ‘‘integral parts of their communities in a way that that police are not; the youths,
                                 women, elders and businessmen contributing to the groups are known through the districts
                                 in which they operate, and people trust them’’. Importantly, while these examples
                                 point to the significance of police officers having a presence in the community, distanced
                                 community–police relations may have some advantages [<a href="#R82">82</a>]. Based on interviews with community-based organisations, NGOs, community members
                                 and police officers in rural and urban parts of Kenya, Gjelsvik [<a href="#R82">82</a>] finds that too-close bonds with local communities may hinder police impartiality
                                 and neutrality, as officers feel obliged to support certain groups or segments of
                                 the population based on tribal affiliation. This perception is also reflected in the
                                 organization of the police in Kenya, in which police officers are to rotate between
                                 different stations [<a href="#R82">82</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e748">Finally, while several cases indicate that the presence of non-state security providers
                                 can challenge community–police relations, in some instances, informal and non-state
                                 security providers may render COP more viable. One such example is identified by Nyborg,
                                 Ganapathy and Nimruzi [<a href="#R69">69</a>] in Afghanistan, where COP has successfully linked local communities, institutions
                                 and the police in a manner that ensures people’s security and trust. Conducing field
                                 research in both Kabul and the southwest, Nyborg, Ganapathy and Nimruzi ([<a href="#R69">69</a>], p.&nbsp;67) found that ‘‘COP pilot projects often introduced with the assistance of
                                 the international community were innovative in creating relations between the police
                                 and communities, including local <i>shura</i>, with the added advantage of supporting gender, youth and minority inclusion’’. This
                                 was confirmed during interviews with the head of one <i>shura</i> in Nimruz, consisting of several clergymen and elders. Here, the leader explained
                                 that the establishment of the <i>shura</i> had reduced crime rates in the city considerably ([<a href="#R83">83</a>], p.&nbsp;64). In itself, the shura contributes to safety and security, and is known for
                                 handling land and famility disputes. Moreover, the shura enables the community to
                                 have a unified voice when communicating with the police ([<a href="#R69">69</a>], p.&nbsp;63). As such, <i>shuras</i> can serve as a bridge between the police and the community [<a href="#R69">69</a>]. One such example identified by Nyborg, Ganapathy and Nimruzi [<a href="#R69">69</a>], was the establishment of the Peoples Shura of Khaja Karim in the North-East of
                                 the Nimruz province. Following the decision to set up weekly meetings with the police
                                 and community members, and the establishment of direct phone line to the police, the
                                 security situation was significantly improved ([<a href="#R69">69</a>], p.&nbsp;63). Based on field research in Afghanistan, Coyne and Nyborg [<a href="#R83">83</a>] nonetheless argue that while a civil society driven, grassroots community policing
                                 approach is favourable, it is more likely to succeed if supported and promoted at
                                 a ministry level.

                              <p id="d1e791">We have seen that there is no uniform model of COP when we analyse how this is practiced
                                 in our cases: we observe wide variations not only between regions and countries but
                                 also within countries. Thus, local adaptations and nuances are essential for external
                                 actors such as the EU or the UN when becoming involved in any reform ‘‘abroad’’, which
                                 is a point also noted by others elsewhere (see for instance [<a href="#R84">84</a>]). Furthermore, in the cases examined, more often than not, multiple security providers,
                                 often competing, can be discerned – mixing old and new, customary and formal law –
                                 in short, legal pluralism. Also relevant on a more specific level is the training
                                 provided to police officers and whether the police receive sufficient pay to make
                                 a living without corruption.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e796">We have identified a number of challenges to COP in our cases. First, and most crucially,
                                 while a reciprocal trust-based relationship between citizens and the police is an
                                 aim of COP as seen from the UN [<a href="#R14">14</a>, <a href="#R85">85</a>], the absence of even basic trust in citizen–police relationships in post-conflict
                                 states acts as a significant barrier to meaningful implementation or progress. This
                                 is partly due to historical grievances and abuse experienced at the hands of law enforcement,
                                 and partly due to the state and its police neither working in the interests of communities
                                 nor being present in parts of the country. On a more fundamental level, this is related
                                 to a divergence between the regime’s understanding of what constitutes security and
                                 insecurity and that of the communities – while the government’s perception of insecurity
                                 favours militarized strategies, in the communities people experience a broader set
                                 of insecurities – more in line with the concept of human security, which also differs
                                 between men and women, young and old; the majority and marginalized groups. Reinforcing
                                 this divergence, cooperation with communities is in some cases used by the police
                                 as a surveillance and intelligence-gathering tool. A heavy-handed strategy by the
                                 police, combined with the police trying to recruite informants, result in fear, resentment
                                 and mistrust towards the police at local levels. This type of police approach also
                                 seems to ignore other insecurities that may be more pressing for local populations,
                                 such as food, health and livelihood insecurities, where crime fighting is only one
                                 aspect of ensuring human security.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e804">Introducing COP in such settings is particularly challenging, as reform implies a
                                 change in power relations, and hence resistance is to be expected. Another observed
                                 challenge is that where the police turn to a militarised approach – as can be seen
                                 in the cases of El Salvador, parts of Kenya, and increasingly in Nicaragua – COP initiatives
                                 are doomed to failure or regression. Widespread corruption and nepotism, cited as
                                 a critical concern among respondents in the three Eastern European cases, also hamper
                                 progress, as does insufficient capacity to detect and prevent crime. Furthermore,
                                 a major obstacle identified in several cases is the lack of knowledge and established
                                 practice on how a community is expected to interact with the police. Finally, community–police
                                 relations are not solely affected by the behaviour of the police or community, but
                                 also by a variety of non-state (in)security providers often present in post-conflict
                                 states. Several cases indicate that community members fear retaliation from gang members
                                 if they are seen to cooperate with the police, or conversely, they fear that the police
                                 are corrupt and will share information with gangs or others who pose a risk to the
                                 community.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e806">However, our cases also reveal examples where COP appears to be working. Above all,
                                 COP practices must be locally rooted and supported. A thread running through the cases
                                 of good practice is that the police are not perceived as being foreign or external,
                                 but rather an integral part of the community. Moving beyond the community and grassroots
                                 level, initiative and support at the state level can also be seen to make the conditions
                                 for COP more favourable. In this regard, people’s perception of the police’s inclusiveness
                                 is important. Moreover, the cases illustrate that it is the quality of the police’s
                                 presence and their interactions with the community that matters. Here, local police
                                 and station commanders have a critical role, as it is their attitude and behaviours
                                 that have the most impact. Findings suggest that, rather than merely transplanting
                                 technical skills, the focus should be on reflection and learning around police culture
                                 and behaviour. Lastly, some non-state security providers may actually make COP more
                                 viable, either because the police do not have a presence in particular areas, or by
                                 acting as a bridge linking the police with the community. Challenges and good practices
                                 of COP from our cases can be summarized in Figure <a href="#Fig2">2</a>.

                              <p id="d1e818">As a philosophy, COP holds promise of increasing communities’ sense of security. This
                                 is first and foremost because COP implies more community involvement, with the community
                                 playing a central role in defining what constitute security and insecurity. This is
                                 also connected to a point valid for several of the places examined namely the widespread
                                 presence of legitimate customary order at the village level. This may call into question
                                 assumptions of an institutional and organizational tabula rasa, which seem to have
                                 driven initial institutional choices by national governments and the international
                                 community when police reforms are introduced [<a href="#R86">86</a>]. However, there is no inherent causality between introducing COP and increased human
                                 security. Indeed, our studies – as well as those by others – show that COP has been
                                 used as a surveillance tool or to legitimise harsh policing tactics just as much as
                                 it has been used to promote human security or undertake serious reforms [<a href="#R87">87</a>]. Hence, there is a divergence between the origins and principles of COP and the
                                 reality on the ground in places where external actors are assisting in implementation.
                                 While the historical origins and its principles are connected to a police <i>service</i>, in the ideal-typical sense, most of the post-conflict cases we have analysed have
                                 more of a police <i>force</i>. This insight should be taken into account in order to provide more realistic expectations
                                 for what can be achieved when implementing future police reforms and COP initiatives.
                                 Finally, we have seen that context matters, and hence, context-sensitivity is essential
                                 when implementing COP. Our cases display greater differences than they do similarities,
                                 with one notable exception: the role of trust.
