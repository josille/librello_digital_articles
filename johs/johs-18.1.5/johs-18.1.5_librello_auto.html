Anti-tobacco
                                 norms are intensively campaigned by international agencies, such as World Health Organisation
                                 (WHO) and non-government organisations (NGOs). Indonesia has not signed and ratified
                                 the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC); however, Indonesian legislation
                                 obligates government agencies such as ministries, universities, and the local government
                                 to control tobacco use. Meanwhile, tobacco remains one of the central sources of income
                                 for Indonesia's state and local economies, a reality that is especially salient for
                                 tobacco farmers and labourers. This study aims to examine the extent to which Indonesia
                                 internalises the anti-tobacco norm. We focused our investigation on features including
                                 norm internalisation and human security, with specific attention to economic and health
                                 security. Our study revealed notable ambivalence in the internalisation of tobacco
                                 norms in Indonesia. This ambivalence reflects conflictual interests over economic
                                 and health security and ambiguity in policymaking concerning tobacco control. Using
                                 a qualitative approach, the authors of this study gathered primary data via in-depth
                                 interviews and FGD with knowledgeable stakeholders, such as government officials,
                                 NGO representatives, health agency workers, farmers, smokers, and academics, and integrated
                                 this data with support from the relevant literature. The findings of the present study
                                 enrich the existing discussion on norm internalisation, particularly as it relates
                                 to tobacco control and other controversial norms.</span></div>

                              <p id="d1e122">Tobacco is part of the global health security agenda because tobacco threatens health
                                 security which causes quite many deaths. According to the WHO, tobacco kills more
                                 than 7 million active smokers and 1.2 million passive smokers per year [<a href="#R1">1</a>]. Moreover, tobacco exposes smokers and non-smokers to toxic emissions that cause
                                 health issues such as high blood pressure, heart attacks, blood clots, lung disease,
                                 and cancer [<a href="#R1">1</a>, <a href="#R2">2</a>]. The nicotine in tobacco has also addictive effects on users, making it difficult
                                 to cease tobacco consumption [<a href="#R2">2</a>, <a href="#R3">3</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e139">Due to the adverse health impacts of tobacco use, many activists have promoted anti-tobacco
                                 norms, which generally means benchmarks, guidelines, or basic rules regarding the
                                 use of tobacco. Although the norms are not binding, they become standards for judging
                                 good and bad behaviour. These actors include scientists, national governments, international
                                 governmental organizations (IGOs), and non-government organisations. They spearheaded
                                 the birth of anti-tobacco movements in various countries. Through their struggle,
                                 the danger of tobacco use to human life has become a global norm imposed by government
                                 as well as a "social and moral norm" upheld by society [<a href="#R4">4</a>]. This norm is the product of these agents’ combined efforts in campaigning to raise
                                 awareness of the dangers of tobacco use and promoting anti-tobacco perspectives.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e144">The WHO formally supported the global anti-tobacco movement by issuing the World Health
                                 Assembly Resolutions WHA40.38 in 1987 about "World No-Smoking Day" and WHA42.19 in
                                 1988 on WHO program on tobacco for health. "World No-Smoking Day" campaigns commemorated
                                 on May 13rd each year thereafter [<a href="#R5">5</a>]. To further combat smoking, several academics from UCLA who were later supported
                                 by several countries such as Canada, Mexico, Finland and Tanzania [<a href="#R6">6</a>] proposed the need for an anti-tobacco convention. This proposal received wide acceptance
                                 and prompted WHO to establish the international "Framework Convention on Tobacco Control"
                                 (FCTC) in 2003 before fully establishing it in 2005. Like many UN conventions, the
                                 FCTC is also non-binding and dependent on the will of the state to accede to it. However,
                                 it contains a strong appeal to prevent the increase in consumption of tobacco and
                                 cigarettes. As of 2019, the FCTC has been ratified by 187 countries [<a href="#R7">7</a>]. This anti-tobacco initiative is also supported by NGOs, such as Framework Convention
                                 Alliance and Globalink, The Framework Convention Alliance and the South-East Asia
                                 Tobacco Control Alliance which actively encourage states to ratify the FCTC and educate
                                 people about tobacco use dangers [<a href="#R8">8</a>]. Tandilittin and Luetge have suggested optimising the role of civil society in implementing
                                 tobacco control in Indonesia [<a href="#R9">9</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e161">Yet there exists a significant conflict of interest issue that must be addressed.
                                 Amidst the intensive campaigns against tobacco consumption due to its health risks,
                                 many people – particularly tobacco farmers, labourers, and small tobacco sellers –
                                 depend on tobacco and its products. For these individuals, tobacco is the primary
                                 source of income for meeting their daily needs. This reality poses a conundrum for
                                 governments, tasked with deciding between health security and economic security. On
                                 one side, tobacco threatens the health security of the community, while on the other
                                 side, tobacco supports the economic security of those whose lives depend upon it as
                                 a critical resource.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e163">Both health security and economic security are part of human security which is a global
                                 concern. Human security is an international norm that aims to guarantee the security
                                 of the individual. It focuses on the ability of individuals or households to meet
                                 their most essential needs in daily life and maintain security from direct violence
                                 and conflict. According to the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), human security
                                 can be understood as "first, safety from such chronic threats as hunger, disease,
                                 and repression. And second, it means protection from sudden and hurtful disruptions
                                 in the patterns of daily life—whether in homes, in jobs or in communities" ([<a href="#R10">10</a>], p.&nbsp;23). As social norms, human security provides guidance on the basis that every
                                 person has the right to "live in freedom and dignity, free from poverty and despair"
                                 [<a href="#R11">11</a>]. Thus, human security consists of protecting the right to live in dignity without
                                 want or fear [<a href="#R12">12</a>].

                              <p id="d1e174">The dilemma of health security and economic security is exemplified by the case of
                                 tobacco in Indonesia. Indonesia is one of the world’s main tobacco producers. In 2019,
                                 Statista noted that Indonesia ranked 6th among the world’s tobacco producers after
                                 China (mainland), India, Brazil, Zimbabwe, and the United States [<a href="#R13">13</a>]. Of these countries, however, Indonesia and the US have not ratified the FCTC [<a href="#R14">14</a>]. The Indonesian government contends that tobacco contributes to national and regional
                                 incomes at the domestic level. According to the Ministry of Industry of the Republic
                                 of Indonesia, in 2016, 96.5% of Indonesian excise was sourced from tobacco which is
                                 about Rp. 139.82 Trillion Rupiah [<a href="#R15">15</a>]. Moreover, tobacco-related industries bring job opportunities, employing 4.28 million
                                 people in the production and distribution sectors and 1.7 million on tobacco plantations
                                 [<a href="#R16">16</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e188">Although it has many advantages, Indonesia government also carries out anti-tobacco
                                 campaigns which resulted in broad support in the community. It can be said that anti-tobacco
                                 views and attitudes have started to become the norms unwritten in society. The anti-tobacco
                                 norm has been accepted generally in Indonesia by both society and the government.
                                 The government has passed legislation such as Government Regulation (PP) 109/2012
                                 concerning the Safety of Materials Containing Addictive Substances in the Form of
                                 Tobacco Products for Health to implement the movement [<a href="#R17">17</a>]. Although the regulation is still in the form of Government Regulation and not at
                                 the level of Law, its implementation is quite broad because each local government
                                 or district is encouraged to have an anti-smoking Regional Regulation. Several Indonesian
                                 prominent figures such as Bogor City Mayor Arya Bima now serves as co-chair of the
                                 Asia Pacific Cities Alliance for Tobacco Control (AP-CAT) [<a href="#R18">18</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e196">Building on these facts, the authors of this paper argue that the contradictory nature
                                 of anti-tobacco norm internalisation in Indonesia is problematic. The Indonesian government
                                 and the majority of its people agree that tobacco endangers community health security.
                                 However, material and psychological obstacles hinder the comprehensive adoption of
                                 anti-tobacco norms in Indonesia, leading to ambivalence towards internalisation both
                                 in government and within certain sectors of society. This ambivalence can be seen,
                                 among other, from the attitude of the government that does not want to ratify the
                                 FCTC but it encourages local governments to implement various anti-smoking regulations.
                                 This attitude departs from the government’s need for income from a fairly large cigarette
                                 tax, which is represented by the Ministry of Finance. However, the Ministry of Health
                                 always pushes for regulations that restrict people from smoking.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e198">This ambiguity is growing quite widely because the wider community also understands
                                 the importance of protecting tobacco farmers who depend on tobacco products for their
                                 lives. Many elements in society see that health is important, but the safety of the
                                 people’s economic life is also important. This situation in turn makes the internalisation
                                 of anti-smoking norms unable to develop properly, which gives birth to tolerant attitudes
                                 towards those who smoke. In the implementation of anti-smoking regulations in society,
                                 for example, although there has been bans on smoking in some public facilities, the
                                 government also provides special smoking zones for smokers.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e200">This study offers contributions academically and empirically. The academic contribution
                                 is the enrichment of knowledge on norm internalisation, particularly as it relates
                                 to anti-tobacco norms in Indonesia. Previous studies have suggested an optimistic
                                 view of the role of norm internalisation in anti-tobacco campaigns. Durkin, et. al.,
                                 for example, stated that social norms greatly contribute to changing people’s behavior
                                 and persuading them to quit smoking [<a href="#R19">19</a>]. Similarly, Hohman, et al. emphasised the important roles of social norms in reducing
                                 smokers’ ambivalence. Accordingly, clear attitudinal prescriptions defined by social
                                 norms have the potential to combat ambivalence [<a href="#R20">20</a>]. Mead, et al. explained that such norms are conveyed to smokers through social exposure
                                 in their social, physical, and symbolic environments [<a href="#R21">21</a>]. Informed by and expanding upon past research, the present study approaches this
                                 issue.

                                 authors of this study designed their research on the basis of the following concepts:
                                 1) norm internalisation and contestation, 2) human security, health security, and
                                 economic security.

                                    <p id="d1e219">Norms can be understood as "standard[s] of appropriate behavior of actors with a given
                                       identity" ([<a href="#R22">22</a>], p.&nbsp;891); norms therefore prescribe guidance for people’s actions. The majority
                                       of a given population accepts norms as "either rules of expected behaviour in a society
                                       or as behaviour that is common in a society" [<a href="#R4">4</a>]. The anti-tobacco view can be considered an international norm, as it is generally
                                       embraced in most of the world. Non-smoking regulations have become common in settings
                                       such as airplanes, trains, schools, hospitals, and other public spaces. Indeed, more
                                       than 95% of states worldwide have ratified the FTCT as an instrument of tobacco control
                                       [<a href="#R7">7</a>].
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e230">To examine anti-tobacco norm internalisation in Indonesia, it is essential to understand
                                       the norm life cycle. Finnemore and Sikkink explain that the norm life cycle has three
                                       stages: norm emergence, norm cascade, and norm internalisation [<a href="#R22">22</a>]. First, "norm emergence" refers to norm making or norm invention by a "norms entrepreneur"
                                       through a persuasive mechanism. This process involves cognitive framing construction,
                                       through which norm entrepreneurs seek to convince "norm leaders" to adopt a new norm.
                                       Norms entrepreneurs must have the ability to achieve securitisation; that is, they
                                       must effectively persuade their audience to recognise formerly non-politicised subjects
                                       as politicised issues, often even as matters of national security [<a href="#R23">23</a>]. In the case of tobacco control, anti-tobacco norm entrepreneurs work to convince
                                       authoritative agencies such as the WHO that tobacco is hazardous and poses a critical
                                       risk to human life.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e238">Second, once norm leaders embrace a new norm, the following step is socialising the
                                       new norm to others and promoting its broader acceptance known as "norm cascade". WHO
                                       is actively and consistently socialising anti-tobacco norms by campaigning about the
                                       dangers of tobacco use, an effort supported by its member states and NGOs. The international
                                       organisation network encourages targeted agents to ratify the new norms and adopt
                                       them in their domestic legislation.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e240">The third and final stage is "norm internalisation", within which the new norm is
                                       widely accepted formally and practically at the state and society levels. Once states
                                       ratify an international norm, they have to make domestic adjustments to integrate
                                       the new standard. Therefore, norm internalisation is primarily reflected in domestic
                                       legislation that enforces the newly adopted norm. Moreover, norms can be categorised
                                       as either "rule norms or social norms". According to Tuomela [<a href="#R24">24</a>], rule norms are the formalized norms imposed by authoritative agencies, such as
                                       national and local governments, based on written law or sanctioned regulations. In
                                       this respect, as a rule norm, the anti-tobacco stance appears in official legislation
                                       issued by government bodies. States that ratify the FCTC have an obligation to comply
                                       by issuing relevant tobacco-control laws and regulations. Social norms, on the other
                                       hand, <i>are de facto</i> standards developed based on a common belief, custom, or convention. As such, social
                                       norms commonly are not written and instead are imposed through verbal communication
                                       – they are socially rather than formally sanctioned [<a href="#R4">4</a>, <a href="#R24">24</a>]. As a social norm, the anti-tobacco standard appears as a societal convention evident
                                       in daily life. For instance, it is common in Indonesian society that smoking is unacceptable
                                       in public area such as hospitals, public transports, schools, and others public spaces.
                                       This has become a generally accepted norm in Indonesian society.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e254">Although Finnemore and Sikkink’s concept of the norm life-cycle is persuasive in explaining
                                       norm internalisation, it should not necessarily to be seen the only available path
                                       to adoption of new norms. This is evidenced by the context of anti-tobacco norm establishment
                                       in Indonesia, where norm internalisation does not appear to follow the model proposed
                                       by Finnemore and Sikkink.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e256">"Norm contestation" refers to the fact that every new norm is subject to diverse interpretation
                                       among actors, with some actors rejecting or at least disregarding the norm [<a href="#R25">25</a>]. In more extreme cases, norm contestation within social practices leads to norm
                                       disapproval [<a href="#R26">26</a>]. The implementation of norms is influenced by time, place, and social context. Each
                                       norm is shaped by "historical and cultural circumstances" in which actors develop
                                       their understanding of the norm ([<a href="#R27">27</a>], p.&nbsp;33). Thus, while a norm is "a shared understanding" or intersubjective agreement
                                       among stakeholders ([<a href="#R28">28</a>], p.&nbsp;30), such agreement is dynamically shaped by actors’ backgrounds and their local
                                       contexts. Different actors have different backgrounds, information, and social contexts
                                       that affect their interpretation of a norm and affect intersubjective agreement. As
                                       a result, norm ambiguity occurs due to plurality of norm interpretation.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e270">According to Antje Wiener [<a href="#R26">26</a>], modes of contestation consist of arbitration, deliberation, justification, and
                                       contention, which are related to the subjects in "law, political sciences, political
                                       theory, and political sociology, respectively" [<a href="#R26">26</a>]. A norm contestation typically occurs due to norm ambiguity and the weak power of
                                       norm enforcers [<a href="#R29">29</a>]. In this sense, a norm contestation framework is useful for explaining the variation
                                       of behaviors observed with regard to anti-tobacco norms. The framework scrutinises
                                       actors’ behaviour and their understanding of normative obligations, whether formal
                                       at the governmental level or semi-formal/informal at the societal level.

                                    <p id="d1e284">Human security is a holistic concept. According to the UNDP, it consists of seven
                                       dimensions: economic, food, health, environment, political, personal, and community
                                       security [<a href="#R10">10</a>]. These dimensions are interrelated, so changes within one dimension might affect
                                       the others. Overemphasising one element might hinder the development of another element;
                                       such is the case between health and economic security in Indonesia, where an anti-tobacco
                                       norm which seeks to ensure health security might threaten the economic security of
                                       those whose lives are dependent upon tobacco production.
                                       
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e289">Health security means freedom from disease and sufficient resources to support a healthy
                                       life, such as food, shelter, and clothing [<a href="#R30">30</a>]. Meanwhile, economic security is a condition in which individuals or households
                                       have assured basic income from their work or social safety nets. Building on the notion
                                       of norm contestation, individuals might have different interpretations of these notions
                                       of security and their relative importance. One might emphasise the importance of economic
                                       security sources such as income, jobs, and basic needs fulfillment, while others might
                                       focus on health issues when defining security, especially if disease has played a
                                       more prominent role in their lives.

                              <p id="d1e297">This study is a qualitative research that employs process tracing methods. A qualitative
                                 approach is useful for understanding participant experiences, perceptions, or opinions
                                 [<a href="#R31">31</a>, <a href="#R32">32</a>]. Qualitative methods are suitable for this study as they enable more thorough examination
                                 of the ambivalent attitudes and policies regarding the internalisation of the anti-tobacco
                                 norm. As opposed to quantitative research, which emphasises the outcome in the form
                                 of data, qualitative research focuses on analysing the process and truly understanding
                                 the meaning or essence of a phenomenon [<a href="#R33">33</a>]. Thus, qualitative research will help this study understand the process of norm
                                 internalisation at the governmental and societal level and their perception about
                                 the meaning of security.

                                 and Bondowoso regencies. The decision to use Indonesia as the case study is based
                                 on reasons that Indonesia is one of the world’s largest tobacco producers and has
                                 not ratified FCTC. Indeed, East Java province, including Jember, Situbondo, and Bondowoso
                                 regencies are tobacco centers in Indonesia.

                                 and policies. Meanwhile, this study employs in-depth interview methods for collecting
                                 primary data. Participants in the in-depth interview are national governments, local
                                 governments, NGOs, tobacco farmers, and the community, including smoking and non-smoking

                                 Ministry of Health. Ministry of Finance represented by Directorate General of Custom
                                 and Excise provides data about revenue obtained from tobacco production and revenue
                                 allocation. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Health represented by the Health Office of
                                 Jember, Bondowoso, and Situbondo regency provides data on the adoption and implementation
                                 of anti-tobacco norms and the impacts of tobacco on health.

                                 Planning Agency, Regional Revenue Offices, and Head of Subdistrict in each regency.
                                 Data gathered from the regencies are as follows: the implementation of tobacco control

                                 implementation of tobacco control at the societal level, societies’ response to the
                                 anti-tobacco norm, and tobacco’s contribution to local communities’ income, especially

                                 Indonesia’s norm internalisation process and the debate between economic and health
                                 security related to the anti-tobacco norm. According to Collier [<a href="#R34">34</a>] and Beach &amp; Pederson [<a href="#R35">35</a>], process tracing is useful for tracing the detail of a phenomenon and analysing
                                 causal mechanisms between independent and dependent variables. The stages in the data
                                 analysis are as follows. <i>Firstly</i>, this study describes in detail the emergence of the anti-tobacco norm at the global
                                 level. It also explains the internalisation and implementation of anti-tobacco norms
                                 based on a chronological order in Indonesia. <i>Secondly</i>, interpretation about causal mechanism based on the detailed description in the first
                                 stage. <i>Lastly</i>, this study concludes that an ambivalent attitude regarding the anti-tobacco norm
                                 internalisation occurs in Indonesia, whether prioritising economic or health security.

                                    <p id="d1e349">The idea about the danger of tobacco has been found since 1950s. It can be traced
                                       back to when Sir (William) Richard Shaboe Doll collaborated with Bradford Hill found
                                       that smoking causes lung cancer and other diseases [<a href="#R36">36</a>]. Doll and Hill’s finding is evidence-based on scientific research about the danger
                                       of tobacco. They published the invention in the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i> in 1950 and the BMJ in 1954. Moreover, they also conduct academic activities such
                                       as research and lecture within which they meet other academicians and scientists to
                                       deliver their findings of the danger of tobacco. However, the findings of the relation
                                       between smoke and lung cancer were not easily accepted by the government, industries,
                                       and society [<a href="#R37">37</a>].
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e360">Building on the idea of Finnemore and Sikkink [<a href="#R22">22</a>], the invention of the danger of tobacco can be categorised as the early stage of
                                       the norm emergence. Nevertheless, in order to the invention becomes a norm in the
                                       phase of norm emergence, it needs a framing or securitisation by which a non-politicised
                                       issue becomes politicised and securitised issue [<a href="#R38">38</a>]. In this stage, norm entrepreneurs of anti-tobacco have to convince the political
                                       leader to adopt anti-tobacco ideas. The norm entrepreneurs consist of intergovernmental
                                       organisations (IGOs), NGOs, states, academicians, community leaders, and individuals.
                                       They work using persuasive methods such as a campaign to promote the anti-tobacco
                                       norms.

                                    <p id="d1e368">In the mid-1960s and 1970s, there were formal meetings such as international conferences
                                       and workshops to socialise the invention about tobacco’s danger. It is an effort to
                                       raise public awareness and government and politicians’ will to concern this issue.
                                       From the securitisation theory point of view, this is the phase when the norm entrepreneurs
                                       blow up and framing the issue. The meeting series mainly initiated by the Western
                                       scientists and governments were conducted in New York, London, and New York in 1967,
                                       1971, 1975, respectively. It is followed by the other series of international conferences
                                       hosted by Australia, United Kingdom, Norway, Canada, and the USA [<a href="#R39">39</a>].

                                    <p id="d1e373">While the Western countries initiated tobacco control, it is started to be globalised
                                       in the decade of 1970s-1990s. The idea about tobacco control has been spread in cross
                                       nationals, including the third world. It is a phase of consolidation as well as intensification
                                       within which the anti-tobacco norm is accepted globally. In the 1990s, many countries
                                       start to issue legislation on tobacco control, for instance, "Tobacco Smoking (Control)
                                       Act" No. 2/1990 [<a href="#R40">40</a>], "Tobacco Control Act 1990" of Western Australia [<a href="#R41">41</a>], "S.1883-Tobacco Product Education and Health Protection Act of 1990" issued by
                                       the USA [<a href="#R42">42</a>], "Smoke-Free Environments ACT 1990" of New Zealand [<a href="#R43">43</a>], and others.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e387">IGOs such as WHO also actively persuade global community about the danger of tobacco.
                                       In its 1988 publication entitled "From Alma-Ata to the Year 2000: reflections at the
                                       midpoint", WHO recognises that tobacco has threatened community health. However, the
                                       book has not formulated strategies to control tobacco use [<a href="#R44">44</a>]. Most WHO member states consider that tobacco danger is a small issue as there are
                                       many important health cases such as malaria, cancer, and family planning which need
                                       WHO’s attention and priority [<a href="#R39">39</a>].
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e395">WHO started to concern tobacco as global pandemic since the late 1999 and early 2000s.
                                       WHO manages to promote an international agreement to combat tobacco danger as well
                                       as controlling the use of tobacco. As a result, WHO supported by the UN and NGOs initiates
                                       FCTC which was signed in 2003 and came into force in 2005. FCTC is a global norm or
                                       guiding principles for raising global awareness and also political will to provide
                                       measures for controlling tobacco smoke. Moreover, the anti-tobacco norm is supported
                                       by academic publications through which academicians seek to influence the community
                                       to prevent the use of tobacco. Several journal articles such as "Tobacco Prevention
                                       and Cessation" [<a href="#R45">45</a>], "Tobacco Control" [<a href="#R46">46</a>] are purposively published for supporting the campaign of anti-tobacco control. They
                                       work together in a norm cascade within which these actors socialise anti-tobacco ideas.

                                    <p id="d1e403">Norm cascade can be seen in the socialisation of FCTC guiding principles. As the most
                                       prominent global anti-tobacco norm, FCTC seeks to propose a comprehensive cooperation
                                       and mechanism to control the use of tobacco in all over the world. In part III, FCTC
                                       regulates several measures to control tobacco suggested as follows: (1) increasing
                                       price and tax; (2) issuing and implementing effective policies, legislation, or regulation
                                       on tobacco control including protection from smoke exposure especially in public space;
                                       (3) prohibiting misleading information about tobacco or smoke such as in its labelling
                                       and its packaging; (4) banning advertisement, promotion, sponsorship of smoke; (5)
                                       provides social education, training, communication, psychological support, and other
                                       means to raise public awareness about the danger of tobacco [<a href="#R47">47</a>].

                                    <p id="d1e408">Norm life cycle model proposed by Finnemore and Sikkink [<a href="#R22">22</a>] argues that once norm entrepreneurs have socialised the norm, the process is followed
                                       by norm internalisation. Norm internalisation is about norm acceptance by the major
                                       of population. More specifically, it contains norm adoption and implementation at
                                       the domestic level. At the global level, as mentioned earlier FCTC has been ratified
                                       by more than 90% member states. It reflects that almost all WHO member states accept
                                       the anti-tobacco norm. Nevertheless, special cases occur in Indonesia since Indonesia
                                       has not ratified FCTC but seeks to implement anti-tobacco control, as discussed in
                                       the following sections.

                                    <p id="d1e416">In the Indonesian context, at least as of 2020, the government has not signed and
                                       ratified the FCTC, but to some extent, Indonesia has issued many similar regulations
                                       regarding tobacco control. Seeing this phenomenon, Indonesia seems to be starting
                                       to internalize universal anti-tobacco values. However, as will be discussed further,
                                       the internalization was neither complete nor smooth. This means that there is still
                                       a reservation because of the government’s great need for tax income from the cigarette
                                       industry. This becomes more complex because of the widespread view that tobacco farmers
                                       and cigarette factory workers are highly dependent on tobacco agriculture and the
                                       cigarette industry.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e418">In other words, debates about anti-tobacco norms are widespread, especially between
                                       contenders of the economic security and health security arguments. Building on Wiener
                                       [<a href="#R48">48</a>], the debate shows norm contestation influenced by the cultural and social contexts
                                       of tobacco stakeholders in Indonesia. The following section examines norm internalisation
                                       in Indonesia, including norm formal validity or reference frameworks in legislation
                                       and government policies [<a href="#R26">26</a>]. The frameworks affect the degree of compliance with anti-tobacco norms.

                                    <p id="d1e426">At the empirical level, it can be seen from several interviews both at the government
                                       official level and at the farmer level. Government officials say that they cannot
                                       do much to limit the use of cigarette as they encounter a dilemma between advocating
                                       tobacco control and worrying about tobacco farmers losing income. In one of the interviews,
                                       a sub-district head said:
                                    </p>

                                          sources of income other than tobacco. Moreover, the government does not have sufficient
                                          capacity to provide economically profitable alternatives to farmers"</i> (Interview with the Sub-district Head of Maesan, September 16, 2020).

                                       <i>In a similar vein, the Pakusari sub-district head in Jember believed that: "the community’s
                                          dependence on tobacco and tobacco industries is very high. Around 90 percent of Pakusari
                                          employees work as tobacco farmers and tobacco warehouse workers". So if tobacco or
                                          cigarettes are banned, it can threaten the livelihood of the people"</i> (Interview, September 25, 2020).

                                       <i>In addition, at the farmer level, there is also an ambivalent attitude. Farmers know
                                          about the anti-smoking campaign, which can easily be found on cigarette packs or banners
                                          that are widely spread around them. However, farmers continue to produce tobacco for
                                          economic reasons. Farmers also, at the same time, consume cigarettes for reasons of
                                          psychological, addicted and part of the culture. Based on interviews with local farmers
                                          regarding the economic reasons, the farmers underlined, "being a tobacco farmer is
                                          the only skill they have because the land is only suitable for tobacco plants … we
                                          cannot farm other than tobacco". While the cultural aspect is also unavoidable in
                                          the farmers’ point of view on tobacco: "tobacco farming symbolises people who dare
                                          to take risks; meaning that tobacco farmers are manly."</i> (Interview, September 17, 2020)

                                             section tries to see further the development of Indonesia’s income from the tobacco
                                             industry. Tobacco is one of the primary commodities grown on Indonesian plantations.
                                             Tobacco plantations are distinguished by ownership; that is, there are government
                                             estates, which belong to the government (<i>Perkebunan Besar Negara</i>/PBN) and smallholder estates, which belong to the people (<i>Perkebunan Rakyat</i>/PR). Currently, the area covered by tobacco plantations in Indonesia is approximately
                                             204,509 ha overseen by PBN (84 ha or 0.04%) and PR (204,425 ha or 99.96%). This data
                                             reflects the fact that tobacco in Indonesia represents the people’s business and livelihood
                                             as opposed to being a government-run industry.

                                          <p id="d1e454">There is an increasing trend of tobacco production in Indonesia. Between 2014 and
                                             2020, the total production of tobacco increased by about 0.7% per year, except in
                                             2016 as shown in Figure <a href="#Fig1">1</a>. The centres of tobacco plantations in Indonesia are Central Java, East Java, and
                                             Nusa Tenggara Barat provinces. Among the three provinces, East Java has produced the
                                             highest amount of tobacco. The contribution of East Java to the total Indonesian tobacco

                                             relatively steady through 2020. As mentioned earlier, most tobacco estates in Indonesia
                                             are organised in community-run smallholders that use traditional farming methods.
                                             Hence, it is likely that the decline in production in 2016 was due to bad climate

                                          <p id="d1e491">Indonesia has long been known as one of the major tobacco producers in the world [<a href="#R13">13</a>]. Nevertheless, there is a declining trend in Indonesian tobacco exports. Exports
                                             have decreased because the demand for tobacco for cigarette production in the domestic
                                             market is very high. According to the Directorate General of Estate Crops, Ministry
                                             of Agriculture Republic of Indonesia, during the years 2010-2018, total exports of
                                             tobacco declined by approximately 0.15%, though the exports did slightly recover in
                                             2017 and 2018. In addition, Indonesia exports raw as opposed to processed tobacco
                                             [<a href="#R49">49</a>] However, Indonesia continues to import tobacco, especially for cigarette industries,
                                             as shown in Figure <a href="#Fig2">2</a>.

                                             more tobacco than its exports. In Indonesia, tobacco estates grow multiple variants
                                             of tobacco, namely <i>Voor-Oogst</i> (VO), Na-Oogst (NO), virginia, burley, and oriental. The variant of VO and NO planted
                                             in Jember, East Java, yields cigar materials exported to Germany, Denmark, Italy,

                                             the obligation of the government to guarantee the availability of raw materials for
                                             domestic industries. Hence, since domestic tobacco plantations do not meet the cigarrete
                                             industries’ needs, tobacco import is permitted. As a result, Indonesia imports Virginia,
                                             Burley, and oriental tobacco from China, India, the United States, Brazil, Turkey,
                                             and Zimbabwe to provide raw materials for cigarette industries [<a href="#R51">51</a>]. As opposed to the cigar as an export commodity, cigarette products are marketed
                                             in domestic areas. In this sense, the high level of tobacco import parallels the high
                                             domestic consumption of tobacco in Indonesia [<a href="#R52">52</a>], as shown in Figure 3 below. The table records the percentage of smokers in Indonesia
                                             above the age of 15; most of the smokers are men. Indeed, despite there has been a
                                             declining trend since 2010, before 2013 half of Indonesian men are smokers.

                                             in Indonesia continues, although it does not increase sharply. Indonesia continues
                                             imports tobacco for the needs of the cigarette industry. Not all of this cigarette
                                             production is, of course, for domestic consumption. But the above developments show
                                             that, despite the awareness of anti-smoking, domestic demand for cigarettes is relatively

                                          <p id="d1e524">It is difficult to ascertain that the stability of Indonesia’s tobacco industry and
                                             consumption is related to the success or failure of anti-tobacco campaigns. The explanation
                                             of this is related to the ambiguous attitude both among the government and the public
                                             regarding the anti-tobacco campaign itself which will be explained later in the next
                                             section. However, in this section it is important to first look at how Indonesia government
                                             tries to internalize anti-smoking norms at the global level into various regulations.
                                             In general, it will be seen that the anti-tobacco regulations tend to tighten tobacco
                                             consumption, but they also tend to provide flexibility for the survival, if not the
                                             expansion of the cigarette industries.

                                          <p id="d1e526">Indonesia has not signed and ratified FCTC, but Indonesia’s legislation and policies
                                             on tobacco control can be traced back to the 1990s. Unlike other countries such as
                                             New Zealand, Nigeria, the USA, and Western Australia that explicitly regulate tobacco
                                             control, Indonesia uses a comparatively moderate approach to implement anti-tobacco
                                             norms. In 1992, under President Soeharto, Indonesia issued Law No. 23 of 1992 on Health,
                                             wherein Article 44 regulates addictive substances. Accordingly, the use of addictive
                                             substances must not endanger the health of individuals, households, communities, or
                                             the environment. Nevertheless, the law does not explain further rules regarding addictive
                                             substances. Therefore, several government regulations (GR) were provided to implement
                                             the law, including tobacco control [<a href="#R53">53</a>].

                                          <p id="d1e531">Seven years later, in 1999, Indonesia issued GR No. 81 of 1999 on the "Safety of Smoking
                                             for Health" as a follow-up to Law No. 23 of 1992. GR No. 81 of 1999 was the first
                                             piece of Indonesian legislation that clearly mentioned tobacco’s dangers. Accordingly,
                                             it identified smoking as one of the addictive substances that endangers individuals
                                             and societies; hence, the legislation conveyed that it was necessary to implement
                                             government oversight of smoking. The original legislation regulated four crucial aspects
                                             of tobacco control: nicotine and tar content, cigarette production and sales, cigarette
                                             promotion and advertisement, and smoking-free areas. Nevertheless, GR No. 81 of 1999
                                             has been amended twice by GR No. 38 of 2000 and GR No. 19 of 2003, amendments that
                                             relaxed the aforementioned legislation and again weakened the internalisation of anti-tobacco
                                             norms in Indonesia.
                                          </p>
                                          <p id="d1e533">According to GR No. 81 of 1999, the maximum level of nicotine and tar contained in
                                             one cigarette (i.e., 1.5 mg and 20 mg, respectively) must be written on the package.
                                             The allocated period of adjustment to nicotine regulation and tar is five years for
                                             large companies and ten years for small companies. The GR also emphasised that any
                                             activities of cigarette production and sales must be conducted only with a permit
                                             from the government. Moreover, cigarette advertisements and promotions are allowed
                                             as long as they are limited to print media or outdoor areas. The GR also obliged tobacco
                                             companies to inform consumers of the dangers of tobacco use in their advertisements.
                                             Lastly, GR No. 81 of 1999 encouraged the designation of public areas such as public
                                             transports, prayer rooms, and children’s areas (e.g., playgrounds) as smoking-free
                                             zones [<a href="#R54">54</a>].

                                          <p id="d1e538">GR No. 81 of 1999 was first amended by GR No. 38 of 2000. Several crucial elements
                                             were changed, especially those related to regulations on nicotine and tar content
                                             and also regarding the maximum adjustment period to conform to such regulations. While
                                             GR No. 81 of 1999 obligated large cigarette companies to adjust with the regulation
                                             on nicotine and tar maximum in five years, GR No. 38 of 2000 prolonged the time of
                                             adjustment to up to seven years. It could be said that the amendment was profitable
                                             to large cigarette companies. Moreover, diverging from GR No. 81 of 1999, GR No. 38
                                             of 2000 allows for promotions and advertisements to be delivered not only in print
                                             media and outdoor areas but also via electronic media from 9.30 p.m. to 05.00 a.m.

                                          <p id="d1e543">The second amendment of GR No. 81 of 1999 was GR No. 19 of 2003. The amendment provides
                                             rule flexibility for tobacco industries since the GR eliminates the regulations limiting
                                             the maximum amount of nicotine and tar in cigarettes and removes the deadline to adjust
                                             nicotine and tar regulations. The amendments have gradually created a setback in anti-tobacco
                                             norm implementation in Indonesia. As a result, tobacco industries enjoy flexibilities
                                             and facilities for their production, promotion or advertisement, and sales [<a href="#R56">56</a>].

                                          <p id="d1e548">Differences in views among the government agencies, resulted in the formulation of
                                             inconsistent regulations. GR No. 81 of 1999 showed the nation’s high willingness to
                                             implement smoking control. However, it was then amended by GR No. 38 of 2000 and GR
                                             No. 19 of 2003, both of which weakened anti-tobacco norm implementation. In contrast,
                                             recent legislation on health, namely Law No. 36 of 2009, seeks to increase anti-tobacco
                                             norm internalisation by clearly regulating tobacco consumption. Article 113 of the
                                             law regulates tobacco as an addictive substance that poses dangers individuals, households,
                                             communities, and the environment. Therefore, the use of tobacco products is now under
                                             the control and license of the government. At the local level, the law also obligates
                                             local governments to regulate smoking-free areas, including public health facilities,
                                             schools, playgrounds, places of worship, public transport, workspaces, and other spaces
                                             [<a href="#R57">57</a>]. Compared to the previous legislation, Law No. 36 of 2009 reflects a serious effort
                                             to internalise anti-tobacco norms in Indonesian legislation. It is supported by the
                                             issuance of Law No. 32 of 2010 on Smoking Prohibition. According to the law, there
                                             is a penalty fine of up to IDR 200,000,000 (two hundred million rupiah) for those
                                             who violate smoking prohibitions in public spaces.

                                          <p id="d1e553">In addition, tobacco control is directly implemented by raising cigarette prices and
                                             taxes such as the excise and cigarette tax. According to Law No. 39 of 2007 concerning
                                             Amendment to Law No. 11 of 1995, excise is a state levy imposed on certain goods such
                                             as alcohol and tobacco products, including cigarettes, cigars, sliced tobacco, and
                                             tobacco leaves. The increase in tobacco product taxes and prices is governed under
                                             Ministry of Finance Regulation (<i>Peraturan Menteri Keuangan</i>/ PMK). Table <a href="#Tab1">1</a> shows tobacco product excises in the period of 2012-2020.
                                          </p>
                                          <p id="d1e561">The increase of taxes and prices shapes the final cost of tobacco products at the
                                             sales level. Thus, this approach aims to dissuade consumers from buying tobacco products.
                                             However, the increase of tobacco product excise for controlling tobacco consumption
                                             has led to an increase in illegal cigarette production. According to an interviewee
                                             from the Directorate General of Custom and Excise, many small home cigarette industries
                                             go bankrupt since they cannot maintain the operational costs of cigarette production
                                             and associated taxes. As a result, some of them turn to producing illegal cigarettes.
                                             Indeed, since cigarette prices are relatively high, local people make their own smoking
                                             goods using tobacco leaves and other ingredients. It is clear that Indonesia remains
                                             in need of more comprehensive, serious law enforcement of tobacco control.

                                             Special Region issued regulation on smoking-free zones in 2010 and was soon followed
                                             by other local governments. As a result, by 2020, approximately 77.2% or 397 regencies
                                             and cities had issued local regulations on smoke-free areas [<a href="#R63">63</a>].

                                          <p id="d1e639">Indonesian legislation on tobacco control, including local regulation, has been relatively
                                             effective in reducing the use of tobacco. A survey conducted by the Ministry of Health
                                             show that increasing percentage of smokers from 2007 to 2010 experienced a gradually
                                             decline from 2010 to 2018, as shown in Figure <a href="#Fig4">4</a> [<a href="#R64">64</a>, <a href="#R65">65</a>, <a href="#R66">66</a>, <a href="#R67">67</a>]. This suggests that under the new laws, Indonesia has made progress in the implementation
                                             of tobacco control. Nevertheless, the survey also found that the smokers in Indonesia
                                             are not only people of working age, as shown in Figure <a href="#Fig4">4</a>, but also children around the age of 10 and the elderly. Furthermore, despite the
                                             fact that the number of smokers is less than that of non-smokers, the dangers of tobacco
                                             also affect non-smoking people and passive smokers [<a href="#R64">64</a>, <a href="#R65">65</a>, <a href="#R66">66</a>, <a href="#R67">67</a>]. Therefore, the Indonesian Ministry of Health has made attempts to increase tobacco
                                             control through regulations of tax and price mechanisms.

                                          <p id="d1e682">The increase of tobacco excises in Indonesia reflects Janus-faced interests for promoting
                                             health security on the one hand and economic security on the other hand. While Indonesia
                                             seeks to control tobacco through tax and price measures, at the same time, Indonesia
                                             also demands funds obtained from tobacco for supporting economic development such
                                             as tourism, infrastructures, and the environment. Currently, tobacco has the highest
                                             contribution to total excise in Indonesia. There are three elements of taxes in tobacco
                                             products, namely excises tax, cigarette tax, and value-added tax (VAT). The cigarette
                                             companies pay tobacco products excise to the Directorate General of Custom and Excise
                                             based on its number of production, its group, and its type of production, whether
                                             machine or hand made. The national government allocates the taxes for funding national
                                             development and also supporting regional governments.

                                          <p id="d1e684">Meanwhile, regional governments manage cigarette tax and other taxes such as the advertisement
                                             and promotion of cigarettes. Based on Law No. 28 of 2009, the amount of cigarette
                                             tax is 10% of the excise. Moreover, regional governments also receive funds allocated
                                             from tobacco products excise by the national government under the scheme of "Revenue
                                             Sharing Fund of Tobacco Products Excises" (<i>Dana Bagi Hasil Cukai Hasil Tembakau</i>/ DBHCHT). The Ministry of Finance transfers DBHCHT to all Indonesian provinces, regencies,
                                             and cities, including tobacco-producing provinces, tobacco-producing regencies or
                                             cities, and non-producer provinces/regencies/cities. From 2010 to 2020, there is an
                                             increasing trend of DBHCHT, as shown in Figure <a href="#Fig5">5</a> is due to the increase in excise and tax. East Java which is the biggest producer

                                          <p id="d1e741">The Indonesian government also uses funds obtained from tobacco products to support
                                             health security. PMK concerning DBHCHT obligates regional governments to allocate
                                             at least 50% of the funds to helping the poor access health facilities, promoting

                                             According to the interviews with officials at the Health Office of Jember, Bondowoso,
                                             and Situbondo regencies, DBHCHT supports hospital facilities by buying medical equipment,

                                          <p id="d1e743">Furthermore, the allocation of DBHCHT is also for facilitating regional governments
                                             to issue regional regulations on smoking-free zones as well as educating people about
                                             the danger of tobacco. Nevertheless, despite many regional government’s issuance of
                                             regulations on smoking-free zone, the negotiation process is quite hard. According
                                             to government officials of Situbondo, Jember, and Bondowoso regencies in the interview
                                             session held on September 2020, there are psychological and cultural obstacles to
                                             controlling tobacco either at the government or parliament and at the society level.
                                             Many parliament and government members who have responsibilities to establish the
                                             norm of tobacco control are themselves addicted to smoking. Indeed, at the society
                                             level, besides smoking habits being linked to addiction, it is also a part of local
                                             culture. As argued by tobacco farmers in these areas, planting tobacco and smoking
                                             reflects masculinity and high status. Tobacco in these regencies is part of people’s
                                             lives; therefore, it needs a comprehensive approach to convince people to control
                                             tobacco use.
                                          </p>
                                          <p id="d1e745">On the other hand, the government also allocates the rest of DBHCHT to promote development,
                                             and economic progress relating to job creation, toward which tobacco industries are
                                             major contributors [<a href="#R80">80</a>]. It also uses the taxes to promoting good tobacco farm practices, improving infrastructures
                                             such as road, market, clean water, sanitation, irrigation, supporting tourism, and
                                             improving the environment through waste management [<a href="#R81">81</a>].

                                          <p id="d1e753">Nevertheless, the data of DBHCT shows that government provides a higher amount of
                                             DBHCHT to regencies or cities wherein cigarette companies operate instead of tobacco-farming
                                             regencies. For instance, in East Java province, the regencies of Jember, Situbondo,
                                             and Bondowoso are the center of tobacco farming; meanwhile, Pasuruan regency does
                                             not develop tobacco farming but has cigarette companies in its territory [<a href="#R82">82</a>]. In this context, Pasuruan regency receives a very high amount of DBHCHT compared
                                             to Jember, Bondowoso, and Situbondo as shown in Figure <a href="#Fig5">5</a> [<a href="#R69">69</a>, <a href="#R70">70</a>, <a href="#R71">71</a>, <a href="#R72">72</a>, <a href="#R73">73</a>, <a href="#R74">74</a>, <a href="#R75">75</a>, <a href="#R76">76</a>, <a href="#R77">77</a>, <a href="#R78">78</a>, <a href="#R79">79</a>].

                                          <p id="d1e796">Figure <a href="#Fig6">6</a> below reflects the fact that even though the farmers make contributions to national
                                             tobacco industries, tobacco-farming regions receive lower DBHCHT than cigarette-producing
                                             regions. In other words, tobacco farmers receive little government support. This is
                                             in line with information learned from tobacco farmers in the interview session conducted
                                             in September 2020. Accordingly, although there are efforts dedicated to improving
                                             tobacco quality as the raw material for tobacco industries, such government programs
                                             do not really help the farmers themselves; hence, these efforts do not directly affect
                                             tobacco farmers’ welfare. However, farmers continue to grow tobacco because of human
                                             resources, experience and traditions of tobacco farming that have been passed down
                                             from generation to generation. It is very rare for tobacco farmers to switch to other
                                             farms. If the price of tobacco falls, they still have hope that the price of tobacco
                                             will improve if demand from abroad increases. Thus, they continue to grow tobacco
                                             as the source of support for their livelihoods. Indeed, as summarized by the head
                                             of the Pakusari Jember subdistrict, tobacco-growing areas are fully dependent on tobacco,
                                             either as farmers or labourers.

                              <p id="d1e811">The description of the results of the research above shows the difficulties faced
                                 in internalizing anti-tobacco norms in Indonesia. In essence, the government is aware
                                 of the dangers of tobacco to society which has become part of the global health threat.
                                 It also carries out various regulations, campaigns, and actions to limit tobacco consumption.
                                 However, the internalization and socialization of these various regulations is not
                                 an easy thing. The government itself, in addition to providing anti-tobacco awareness,
                                 wants to ensure that the cigarette industry continues to run. The government enjoys
                                 a somewhat increasing income every year from cigarette excise which is really needed
                                 for development in various fields including health.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e813">The government indeed encourages anti-smoking campaigns to reach all regions, pushes
                                 local governments to make anti-tobacco regulations and continues to campaign for the
                                 dangers of smoking to the public. But the action was not followed by strict implementations
                                 of the rules and regulations, even officials tolerate smokers in many places or provide
                                 special zones if the place is smoke-free.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e815">In various observations and research interviews in the field, the above phenomena
                                 are widely recognized in the community and interpreted almost uniformly. The public
                                 generally understands the government’s difficulties and also the difficulties that
                                 tobacco farmers and tobacco industry workers will face if the anti-smoking campaign
                                 is carried out consistently. This is coupled with the assumption that tobacco has
                                 been a farmer’s traditional crop since the colonial era, which make people keep thinking
                                 that if tobacco is banned, then these farmers will suffer. This kind of meaning gives
                                 birth to an attitude that tolerates government regulations and policies that seem
                                 ambiguous, weak, and inconsistent.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e817">Thus, although awareness of the dangers of tobacco uses is widespread in Indonesia,
                                 the internalization of global anti-tobacco norms will still encounter significant
                                 obstacles. The widely accepted view about tobacco consumption is certainly not entirely
                                 true, because tobacco farmers can look for other sources of income. Their economic
                                 security does not depend only on tobacco farming. Indeed, in certain areas where this
                                 research was conducted, tobacco is still one of the drivers of the economy. However,
                                 in the long term, the fate of these farmers is unclear. They do not get significant
                                 support from the government even though they have contributed to the tobacco industry.
                                 Their number does not increase, if not decrease. Many farmers depend on tobacco for
                                 their livelihood because tobacco has become their farming tradition. To increase their
                                 income, majority of these farmers need to grow crops other than tobacco on their lands
                                 at different planting times. This can indeed be a solution for the economic security
                                 of tobacco farmers.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e819">Thus, it is the persistence of the ambivalence view of tobacco that has strengthened
                                 ambiguity not only among the government but also in society in viewing the smoking
                                 ban campaigns. As long as this view exists, the anti-tobacco campaigns in Indonesia
                                 will not be effective because it will meet the fickle attitude of the government and
                                 society that tolerates smokers. Internalization of anti-smoking norms in such situations
                                 requires greater government commitment to strengthen anti-smoking campaigns and to
                                 convince the public that tobacco farmers have other options for making a living.
