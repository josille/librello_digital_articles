                  <p class="first" id="d1e107">It is widely accepted that tobacco is a threat to public health security. Anti-tobacco
                     norms are intensively campaigned by international agencies, such as World Health Organisation
                     (WHO) and non-government organisations (NGOs). Indonesia has not signed and ratified
                     the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC); however, Indonesian legislation
                     obligates government agencies such as ministries, universities, and the local government
                     to control tobacco use. Meanwhile, tobacco remains one of the central sources of income
                     for Indonesia's state and local economies, a reality that is especially salient for
                     tobacco farmers and labourers. This study aims to examine the extent to which Indonesia
                     internalises the anti-tobacco norm. We focused our investigation on features including
                     norm internalisation and human security, with specific attention to economic and health
                     security. Our study revealed notable ambivalence in the internalisation of tobacco
                     norms in Indonesia. This ambivalence reflects conflictual interests over economic
                     and health security and ambiguity in policymaking concerning tobacco control. Using
                     a qualitative approach, the authors of this study gathered primary data via in-depth
                     interviews and FGD with knowledgeable stakeholders, such as government officials,
                     NGO representatives, health agency workers, farmers, smokers, and academics, and integrated
                     this data with support from the relevant literature. The findings of the present study
                     enrich the existing discussion on norm internalisation, particularly as it relates
                     to tobacco control and other controversial norms.

               <!-- named anchor --></a><h2 class="main-title">1.- Introduction</h2>
            <p id="d1e122">Tobacco is part of the global health security agenda because tobacco threatens health
               security which causes quite many deaths. According to the WHO, tobacco kills more
               than 7 million active smokers and 1.2 million passive smokers per year [<a href="#R1">1</a>]. Moreover, tobacco exposes smokers and non-smokers to toxic emissions that cause
               health issues such as high blood pressure, heart attacks, blood clots, lung disease,
               and cancer [<a href="#R1">1</a>, <a href="#R2">2</a>]. The nicotine in tobacco has also addictive effects on users, making it difficult
               to cease tobacco consumption [<a href="#R2">2</a>, <a href="#R3">3</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e139">Due to the adverse health impacts of tobacco use, many activists have promoted anti-tobacco
               norms, which generally means benchmarks, guidelines, or basic rules regarding the
               use of tobacco. Although the norms are not binding, they become standards for judging
               good and bad behaviour. These actors include scientists, national governments, international
               governmental organizations (IGOs), and non-government organisations. They spearheaded
               the birth of anti-tobacco movements in various countries. Through their struggle,
               the danger of tobacco use to human life has become a global norm imposed by government
               as well as a "social and moral norm" upheld by society [<a href="#R4">4</a>]. This norm is the product of these agents’ combined efforts in campaigning to raise
               awareness of the dangers of tobacco use and promoting anti-tobacco perspectives.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e144">The WHO formally supported the global anti-tobacco movement by issuing the World Health
               Assembly Resolutions WHA40.38 in 1987 about "World No-Smoking Day" and WHA42.19 in
               1988 on WHO program on tobacco for health. "World No-Smoking Day" campaigns commemorated
               on May 13rd each year thereafter [<a href="#R5">5</a>]. To further combat smoking, several academics from UCLA who were later supported
               by several countries such as Canada, Mexico, Finland and Tanzania [<a href="#R6">6</a>] proposed the need for an anti-tobacco convention. This proposal received wide acceptance
               and prompted WHO to establish the international "Framework Convention on Tobacco Control"
               (FCTC) in 2003 before fully establishing it in 2005. Like many UN conventions, the
               FCTC is also non-binding and dependent on the will of the state to accede to it. However,
               it contains a strong appeal to prevent the increase in consumption of tobacco and
               cigarettes. As of 2019, the FCTC has been ratified by 187 countries [<a href="#R7">7</a>]. This anti-tobacco initiative is also supported by NGOs, such as Framework Convention
               Alliance and Globalink, The Framework Convention Alliance and the South-East Asia
               Tobacco Control Alliance which actively encourage states to ratify the FCTC and educate
               people about tobacco use dangers [<a href="#R8">8</a>]. Tandilittin and Luetge have suggested optimising the role of civil society in implementing
               tobacco control in Indonesia [<a href="#R9">9</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e161">Yet there exists a significant conflict of interest issue that must be addressed.
               Amidst the intensive campaigns against tobacco consumption due to its health risks,
               many people – particularly tobacco farmers, labourers, and small tobacco sellers –
               depend on tobacco and its products. For these individuals, tobacco is the primary
               source of income for meeting their daily needs. This reality poses a conundrum for
               governments, tasked with deciding between health security and economic security. On
               one side, tobacco threatens the health security of the community, while on the other
               side, tobacco supports the economic security of those whose lives depend upon it as
               a critical resource.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e163">Both health security and economic security are part of human security which is a global
               concern. Human security is an international norm that aims to guarantee the security
               of the individual. It focuses on the ability of individuals or households to meet
               their most essential needs in daily life and maintain security from direct violence
               and conflict. According to the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), human security
               can be understood as "first, safety from such chronic threats as hunger, disease,
               and repression. And second, it means protection from sudden and hurtful disruptions
               in the patterns of daily life—whether in homes, in jobs or in communities" ([<a href="#R10">10</a>], p.&nbsp;23). As social norms, human security provides guidance on the basis that every
               person has the right to "live in freedom and dignity, free from poverty and despair"
               [<a href="#R11">11</a>]. Thus, human security consists of protecting the right to live in dignity without
               want or fear [<a href="#R12">12</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e174">The dilemma of health security and economic security is exemplified by the case of
               tobacco in Indonesia. Indonesia is one of the world’s main tobacco producers. In 2019,
               Statista noted that Indonesia ranked 6th among the world’s tobacco producers after
               China (mainland), India, Brazil, Zimbabwe, and the United States [<a href="#R13">13</a>]. Of these countries, however, Indonesia and the US have not ratified the FCTC [<a href="#R14">14</a>]. The Indonesian government contends that tobacco contributes to national and regional
               incomes at the domestic level. According to the Ministry of Industry of the Republic
               of Indonesia, in 2016, 96.5% of Indonesian excise was sourced from tobacco which is
               about Rp. 139.82 Trillion Rupiah [<a href="#R15">15</a>]. Moreover, tobacco-related industries bring job opportunities, employing 4.28 million
               people in the production and distribution sectors and 1.7 million on tobacco plantations
               [<a href="#R16">16</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e188">Although it has many advantages, Indonesia government also carries out anti-tobacco
               campaigns which resulted in broad support in the community. It can be said that anti-tobacco
               views and attitudes have started to become the norms unwritten in society. The anti-tobacco
               norm has been accepted generally in Indonesia by both society and the government.
               The government has passed legislation such as Government Regulation (PP) 109/2012
               concerning the Safety of Materials Containing Addictive Substances in the Form of
               Tobacco Products for Health to implement the movement [<a href="#R17">17</a>]. Although the regulation is still in the form of Government Regulation and not at
               the level of Law, its implementation is quite broad because each local government
               or district is encouraged to have an anti-smoking Regional Regulation. Several Indonesian
               prominent figures such as Bogor City Mayor Arya Bima now serves as co-chair of the
               Asia Pacific Cities Alliance for Tobacco Control (AP-CAT) [<a href="#R18">18</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e196">Building on these facts, the authors of this paper argue that the contradictory nature
               of anti-tobacco norm internalisation in Indonesia is problematic. The Indonesian government
               and the majority of its people agree that tobacco endangers community health security.
               However, material and psychological obstacles hinder the comprehensive adoption of
               anti-tobacco norms in Indonesia, leading to ambivalence towards internalisation both
               in government and within certain sectors of society. This ambivalence can be seen,
               among other, from the attitude of the government that does not want to ratify the
               FCTC but it encourages local governments to implement various anti-smoking regulations.
               This attitude departs from the government’s need for income from a fairly large cigarette
               tax, which is represented by the Ministry of Finance. However, the Ministry of Health
               always pushes for regulations that restrict people from smoking.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e198">This ambiguity is growing quite widely because the wider community also understands
               the importance of protecting tobacco farmers who depend on tobacco products for their
               lives. Many elements in society see that health is important, but the safety of the
               people’s economic life is also important. This situation in turn makes the internalisation
               of anti-smoking norms unable to develop properly, which gives birth to tolerant attitudes
               towards those who smoke. In the implementation of anti-smoking regulations in society,
               for example, although there has been bans on smoking in some public facilities, the
               government also provides special smoking zones for smokers.

            <p id="d1e200">This study offers contributions academically and empirically. The academic contribution
               is the enrichment of knowledge on norm internalisation, particularly as it relates
               to anti-tobacco norms in Indonesia. Previous studies have suggested an optimistic
               view of the role of norm internalisation in anti-tobacco campaigns. Durkin, et. al.,
               for example, stated that social norms greatly contribute to changing people’s behavior
               and persuading them to quit smoking [<a href="#R19">19</a>]. Similarly, Hohman, et al. emphasised the important roles of social norms in reducing
               smokers’ ambivalence. Accordingly, clear attitudinal prescriptions defined by social
               norms have the potential to combat ambivalence [<a href="#R20">20</a>]. Mead, et al. explained that such norms are conveyed to smokers through social exposure
               in their social, physical, and symbolic environments [<a href="#R21">21</a>]. Informed by and expanding upon past research, the present study approaches this
               issue.

            <p id="d1e214">To determine the extent to which Indonesia has internalised anti-tobacco norms, the
               authors of this study designed their research on the basis of the following concepts:
               1) norm internalisation and contestation, 2) human security, health security, and
               economic security.
            </p>

                  <!-- named anchor --></a><h3 class="section-title">2.1.- Norm Internationalisation and Norm Contestation</h3>
               <p id="d1e219">Norms can be understood as "standard[s] of appropriate behavior of actors with a given
                  identity" ([<a href="#R22">22</a>], p.&nbsp;891); norms therefore prescribe guidance for people’s actions. The majority
                  of a given population accepts norms as "either rules of expected behaviour in a society
                  or as behaviour that is common in a society" [<a href="#R4">4</a>]. The anti-tobacco view can be considered an international norm, as it is generally
                  embraced in most of the world. Non-smoking regulations have become common in settings
                  such as airplanes, trains, schools, hospitals, and other public spaces. Indeed, more
                  than 95% of states worldwide have ratified the FTCT as an instrument of tobacco control
                  [<a href="#R7">7</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e230">To examine anti-tobacco norm internalisation in Indonesia, it is essential to understand
                  the norm life cycle. Finnemore and Sikkink explain that the norm life cycle has three
                  stages: norm emergence, norm cascade, and norm internalisation [<a href="#R22">22</a>]. First, "norm emergence" refers to norm making or norm invention by a "norms entrepreneur"
                  through a persuasive mechanism. This process involves cognitive framing construction,
                  through which norm entrepreneurs seek to convince "norm leaders" to adopt a new norm.
                  Norms entrepreneurs must have the ability to achieve securitisation; that is, they
                  must effectively persuade their audience to recognise formerly non-politicised subjects
                  as politicised issues, often even as matters of national security [<a href="#R23">23</a>]. In the case of tobacco control, anti-tobacco norm entrepreneurs work to convince
                  authoritative agencies such as the WHO that tobacco is hazardous and poses a critical
                  risk to human life.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e238">Second, once norm leaders embrace a new norm, the following step is socialising the
                  new norm to others and promoting its broader acceptance known as "norm cascade". WHO
                  is actively and consistently socialising anti-tobacco norms by campaigning about the
                  dangers of tobacco use, an effort supported by its member states and NGOs. The international
                  organisation network encourages targeted agents to ratify the new norms and adopt
                  them in their domestic legislation.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e240">The third and final stage is "norm internalisation", within which the new norm is
                  widely accepted formally and practically at the state and society levels. Once states
                  ratify an international norm, they have to make domestic adjustments to integrate
                  the new standard. Therefore, norm internalisation is primarily reflected in domestic
                  legislation that enforces the newly adopted norm. Moreover, norms can be categorised
                  as either "rule norms or social norms". According to Tuomela [<a href="#R24">24</a>], rule norms are the formalized norms imposed by authoritative agencies, such as
                  national and local governments, based on written law or sanctioned regulations. In
                  this respect, as a rule norm, the anti-tobacco stance appears in official legislation
                  issued by government bodies. States that ratify the FCTC have an obligation to comply
                  by issuing relevant tobacco-control laws and regulations. Social norms, on the other
                  hand, <i>are de facto</i> standards developed based on a common belief, custom, or convention. As such, social
                  norms commonly are not written and instead are imposed through verbal communication
                  – they are socially rather than formally sanctioned [<a href="#R4">4</a>, <a href="#R24">24</a>]. As a social norm, the anti-tobacco standard appears as a societal convention evident
                  in daily life. For instance, it is common in Indonesian society that smoking is unacceptable
                  in public area such as hospitals, public transports, schools, and others public spaces.
                  This has become a generally accepted norm in Indonesian society.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e254">Although Finnemore and Sikkink’s concept of the norm life-cycle is persuasive in explaining
                  norm internalisation, it should not necessarily to be seen the only available path
                  to adoption of new norms. This is evidenced by the context of anti-tobacco norm establishment
                  in Indonesia, where norm internalisation does not appear to follow the model proposed
                  by Finnemore and Sikkink.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e256">"Norm contestation" refers to the fact that every new norm is subject to diverse interpretation
                  among actors, with some actors rejecting or at least disregarding the norm [<a href="#R25">25</a>]. In more extreme cases, norm contestation within social practices leads to norm
                  disapproval [<a href="#R26">26</a>]. The implementation of norms is influenced by time, place, and social context. Each
                  norm is shaped by "historical and cultural circumstances" in which actors develop
                  their understanding of the norm ([<a href="#R27">27</a>], p.&nbsp;33). Thus, while a norm is "a shared understanding" or intersubjective agreement
                  among stakeholders ([<a href="#R28">28</a>], p.&nbsp;30), such agreement is dynamically shaped by actors’ backgrounds and their local
                  contexts. Different actors have different backgrounds, information, and social contexts
                  that affect their interpretation of a norm and affect intersubjective agreement. As
                  a result, norm ambiguity occurs due to plurality of norm interpretation.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e270">According to Antje Wiener [<a href="#R26">26</a>], modes of contestation consist of arbitration, deliberation, justification, and
                  contention, which are related to the subjects in "law, political sciences, political
                  theory, and political sociology, respectively" [<a href="#R26">26</a>]. A norm contestation typically occurs due to norm ambiguity and the weak power of
                  norm enforcers [<a href="#R29">29</a>]. In this sense, a norm contestation framework is useful for explaining the variation
                  of behaviors observed with regard to anti-tobacco norms. The framework scrutinises
                  actors’ behaviour and their understanding of normative obligations, whether formal
                  at the governmental level or semi-formal/informal at the societal level.

               <p id="d1e284">Human security is a holistic concept. According to the UNDP, it consists of seven
                  dimensions: economic, food, health, environment, political, personal, and community
                  security [<a href="#R10">10</a>]. These dimensions are interrelated, so changes within one dimension might affect
                  the others. Overemphasising one element might hinder the development of another element;
                  such is the case between health and economic security in Indonesia, where an anti-tobacco
                  norm which seeks to ensure health security might threaten the economic security of
                  those whose lives are dependent upon tobacco production.
                  
               </p>
               <p id="d1e289">Health security means freedom from disease and sufficient resources to support a healthy
                  life, such as food, shelter, and clothing [<a href="#R30">30</a>]. Meanwhile, economic security is a condition in which individuals or households
                  have assured basic income from their work or social safety nets. Building on the notion
                  of norm contestation, individuals might have different interpretations of these notions
                  of security and their relative importance. One might emphasise the importance of economic
                  security sources such as income, jobs, and basic needs fulfillment, while others might
                  focus on health issues when defining security, especially if disease has played a
                  more prominent role in their lives.

               and Excise provides data about revenue obtained from tobacco production and revenue
               allocation. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Health represented by the Health Office of

               Data gathered from the regencies are as follows: the implementation of tobacco control
               at the regional level, regional revenue obtained from tobacco production, the contribution
               of tobacco to regional development, and the allocation of tobacco revenue.

               causal mechanisms between independent and dependent variables. The stages in the data
               analysis are as follows. <i>Firstly</i>, this study describes in detail the emergence of the anti-tobacco norm at the global
               level. It also explains the internalisation and implementation of anti-tobacco norms
               based on a chronological order in Indonesia. <i>Secondly</i>, interpretation about causal mechanism based on the detailed description in the first
               stage. <i>Lastly</i>, this study concludes that an ambivalent attitude regarding the anti-tobacco norm

               <p id="d1e350">The idea about the danger of tobacco has been found since 1950s. It can be traced
                  back to when Sir (William) Richard Shaboe Doll collaborated with Bradford Hill found
                  that smoking causes lung cancer and other diseases [<a href="#R36">36</a>]. Doll and Hill’s finding is evidence-based on scientific research about the danger
                  of tobacco. They published the invention in the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i> in 1950 and the BMJ in 1954. Moreover, they also conduct academic activities such
                  as research and lecture within which they meet other academicians and scientists to
                  deliver their findings of the danger of tobacco. However, the findings of the relation
                  between smoke and lung cancer were not easily accepted by the government, industries,
                  and society [<a href="#R37">37</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e361">Building on the idea of Finnemore and Sikkink [<a href="#R22">22</a>], the invention of the danger of tobacco can be categorised as the early stage of
                  the norm emergence. Nevertheless, in order to the invention becomes a norm in the
                  phase of norm emergence, it needs a framing or securitisation by which a non-politicised
                  issue becomes politicised and securitised issue [<a href="#R38">38</a>]. In this stage, norm entrepreneurs of anti-tobacco have to convince the political
                  leader to adopt anti-tobacco ideas. The norm entrepreneurs consist of intergovernmental
                  organisations (IGOs), NGOs, states, academicians, community leaders, and individuals.
                  They work using persuasive methods such as a campaign to promote the anti-tobacco
                  norms.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e369">In the mid-1960s and 1970s, there were formal meetings such as international conferences
                  and workshops to socialise the invention about tobacco’s danger. It is an effort to
                  raise public awareness and government and politicians’ will to concern this issue.
                  From the securitisation theory point of view, this is the phase when the norm entrepreneurs
                  blow up and framing the issue. The meeting series mainly initiated by the Western
                  scientists and governments were conducted in New York, London, and New York in 1967,
                  1971, 1975, respectively. It is followed by the other series of international conferences
                  hosted by Australia, United Kingdom, Norway, Canada, and the USA [<a href="#R39">39</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e374">While the Western countries initiated tobacco control, it is started to be globalised
                  in the decade of 1970s-1990s. The idea about tobacco control has been spread in cross
                  nationals, including the third world. It is a phase of consolidation as well as intensification
                  within which the anti-tobacco norm is accepted globally. In the 1990s, many countries
                  start to issue legislation on tobacco control, for instance, "Tobacco Smoking (Control)
                  Act" No. 2/1990 [<a href="#R40">40</a>], "Tobacco Control Act 1990" of Western Australia [<a href="#R41">41</a>], "S.1883-Tobacco Product Education and Health Protection Act of 1990" issued by
                  the USA [<a href="#R42">42</a>], "Smoke-Free Environments ACT 1990" of New Zealand [<a href="#R43">43</a>], and others.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e388">IGOs such as WHO also actively persuade global community about the danger of tobacco.
                  In its 1988 publication entitled "From Alma-Ata to the Year 2000: reflections at the
                  midpoint", WHO recognises that tobacco has threatened community health. However, the
                  book has not formulated strategies to control tobacco use [<a href="#R44">44</a>]. Most WHO member states consider that tobacco danger is a small issue as there are
                  many important health cases such as malaria, cancer, and family planning which need
                  WHO’s attention and priority [<a href="#R39">39</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e396">WHO started to concern tobacco as global pandemic since the late 1999 and early 2000s.
                  WHO manages to promote an international agreement to combat tobacco danger as well
                  as controlling the use of tobacco. As a result, WHO supported by the UN and NGOs initiates
                  FCTC which was signed in 2003 and came into force in 2005. FCTC is a global norm or
                  guiding principles for raising global awareness and also political will to provide
                  measures for controlling tobacco smoke. Moreover, the anti-tobacco norm is supported
                  by academic publications through which academicians seek to influence the community
                  to prevent the use of tobacco. Several journal articles such as "Tobacco Prevention
                  and Cessation" [<a href="#R45">45</a>], "Tobacco Control" [<a href="#R46">46</a>] are purposively published for supporting the campaign of anti-tobacco control. They
                  work together in a norm cascade within which these actors socialise anti-tobacco ideas.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e404">Norm cascade can be seen in the socialisation of FCTC guiding principles. As the most
                  prominent global anti-tobacco norm, FCTC seeks to propose a comprehensive cooperation
                  and mechanism to control the use of tobacco in all over the world. In part III, FCTC
                  regulates several measures to control tobacco suggested as follows: (1) increasing
                  price and tax; (2) issuing and implementing effective policies, legislation, or regulation
                  on tobacco control including protection from smoke exposure especially in public space;
                  (3) prohibiting misleading information about tobacco or smoke such as in its labelling
                  and its packaging; (4) banning advertisement, promotion, sponsorship of smoke; (5)
                  provides social education, training, communication, psychological support, and other
                  means to raise public awareness about the danger of tobacco [<a href="#R47">47</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e409">Norm life cycle model proposed by Finnemore and Sikkink [<a href="#R22">22</a>] argues that once norm entrepreneurs have socialised the norm, the process is followed
                  by norm internalisation. Norm internalisation is about norm acceptance by the major
                  of population. More specifically, it contains norm adoption and implementation at
                  the domestic level. At the global level, as mentioned earlier FCTC has been ratified
                  by more than 90% member states. It reflects that almost all WHO member states accept
                  the anti-tobacco norm. Nevertheless, special cases occur in Indonesia since Indonesia
                  has not ratified FCTC but seeks to implement anti-tobacco control, as discussed in
                  the following sections.

               <p id="d1e417">In the Indonesian context, at least as of 2020, the government has not signed and
                  ratified the FCTC, but to some extent, Indonesia has issued many similar regulations
                  regarding tobacco control. Seeing this phenomenon, Indonesia seems to be starting
                  to internalize universal anti-tobacco values. However, as will be discussed further,
                  the internalization was neither complete nor smooth. This means that there is still
                  a reservation because of the government’s great need for tax income from the cigarette
                  industry. This becomes more complex because of the widespread view that tobacco farmers
                  and cigarette factory workers are highly dependent on tobacco agriculture and the
                  cigarette industry.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e419">In other words, debates about anti-tobacco norms are widespread, especially between
                  contenders of the economic security and health security arguments. Building on Wiener
                  [<a href="#R48">48</a>], the debate shows norm contestation influenced by the cultural and social contexts
                  of tobacco stakeholders in Indonesia. The following section examines norm internalisation
                  in Indonesia, including norm formal validity or reference frameworks in legislation
                  and government policies [<a href="#R26">26</a>]. The frameworks affect the degree of compliance with anti-tobacco norms.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e427">At the empirical level, it can be seen from several interviews both at the government
                  official level and at the farmer level. Government officials say that they cannot
                  do much to limit the use of cigarette as they encounter a dilemma between advocating
                  tobacco control and worrying about tobacco farmers losing income. In one of the interviews,
                  a sub-district head said:
               </p>
               <p id="d1e429">
                  <i>"We are well aware that smoking is unhealthy and even dangerous. However, we are as
                     the the government officials aware of the farmers’ difficulties who do not have alternative
                     sources of income other than tobacco. Moreover, the government does not have sufficient
                     capacity to provide economically profitable alternatives to farmers"</i> (Interview with the Sub-district Head of Maesan, September 16, 2020).
               </p>
               <p id="d1e434">
                  <i>In a similar vein, the Pakusari sub-district head in Jember believed that: "the community’s
                     dependence on tobacco and tobacco industries is very high. Around 90 percent of Pakusari
                     employees work as tobacco farmers and tobacco warehouse workers". So if tobacco or
                     cigarettes are banned, it can threaten the livelihood of the people"</i> (Interview, September 25, 2020).
                  
               </p>
               <p id="d1e439">
                  <i>In addition, at the farmer level, there is also an ambivalent attitude. Farmers know
                     about the anti-smoking campaign, which can easily be found on cigarette packs or banners
                     that are widely spread around them. However, farmers continue to produce tobacco for
                     economic reasons. Farmers also, at the same time, consume cigarettes for reasons of
                     psychological, addicted and part of the culture. Based on interviews with local farmers
                     regarding the economic reasons, the farmers underlined, "being a tobacco farmer is
                     the only skill they have because the land is only suitable for tobacco plants … we
                     cannot farm other than tobacco". While the cultural aspect is also unavoidable in
                     the farmers’ point of view on tobacco: "tobacco farming symbolises people who dare
                     to take risks; meaning that tobacco farmers are manly."</i> (Interview, September 17, 2020)

                  <p id="d1e447">In order to see the size of the government’s income from the tobacco industry, this
                     section tries to see further the development of Indonesia’s income from the tobacco
                     industry. Tobacco is one of the primary commodities grown on Indonesian plantations.
                     Tobacco plantations are distinguished by ownership; that is, there are government
                     estates, which belong to the government (<i>Perkebunan Besar Negara</i>/PBN) and smallholder estates, which belong to the people (<i>Perkebunan Rakyat</i>/PR). Currently, the area covered by tobacco plantations in Indonesia is approximately
                     204,509 ha overseen by PBN (84 ha or 0.04%) and PR (204,425 ha or 99.96%). This data
                     reflects the fact that tobacco in Indonesia represents the people’s business and livelihood
                     as opposed to being a government-run industry.
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e455">There is an increasing trend of tobacco production in Indonesia. Between 2014 and
                     2020, the total production of tobacco increased by about 0.7% per year, except in
                     2016 as shown in Figure <a href="#Fig1">1</a>. The centres of tobacco plantations in Indonesia are Central Java, East Java, and
                     Nusa Tenggara Barat provinces. Among the three provinces, East Java has produced the
                     highest amount of tobacco. The contribution of East Java to the total Indonesian tobacco
                     production is about 43.45%.

                  <p id="d1e487">Figure <a href="#Fig1">1</a> shows that tobacco production only decreased in 2016 before stabilising and remaining
                     relatively steady through 2020. As mentioned earlier, most tobacco estates in Indonesia
                     are organised in community-run smallholders that use traditional farming methods.
                     Hence, it is likely that the decline in production in 2016 was due to bad climate
                     changes.
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e492">Indonesia has long been known as one of the major tobacco producers in the world [<a href="#R13">13</a>]. Nevertheless, there is a declining trend in Indonesian tobacco exports. Exports
                     have decreased because the demand for tobacco for cigarette production in the domestic
                     market is very high. According to the Directorate General of Estate Crops, Ministry
                     of Agriculture Republic of Indonesia, during the years 2010-2018, total exports of
                     tobacco declined by approximately 0.15%, though the exports did slightly recover in
                     2017 and 2018. In addition, Indonesia exports raw as opposed to processed tobacco
                     [<a href="#R49">49</a>] However, Indonesia continues to import tobacco, especially for cigarette industries,
                     as shown in Figure <a href="#Fig2">2</a>.
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e503">Figure <a href="#Fig2">2</a> shows a deficit in the balance of trade in tobacco commodities where Indonesia imports
                     more tobacco than its exports. In Indonesia, tobacco estates grow multiple variants
                     of tobacco, namely <i>Voor-Oogst</i> (VO), Na-Oogst (NO), virginia, burley, and oriental. The variant of VO and NO planted
                     in Jember, East Java, yields cigar materials exported to Germany, Denmark, Italy,
                     Poland, Switzerland, China, and Singapore [<a href="#R50">50</a>]. On the other hand, tobacco import is allowed under Law No. 3/2014, which regulates
                     the obligation of the government to guarantee the availability of raw materials for
                     domestic industries. Hence, since domestic tobacco plantations do not meet the cigarrete
                     industries’ needs, tobacco import is permitted. As a result, Indonesia imports Virginia,
                     Burley, and oriental tobacco from China, India, the United States, Brazil, Turkey,
                     and Zimbabwe to provide raw materials for cigarette industries [<a href="#R51">51</a>]. As opposed to the cigar as an export commodity, cigarette products are marketed
                     in domestic areas. In this sense, the high level of tobacco import parallels the high
                     domestic consumption of tobacco in Indonesia [<a href="#R52">52</a>], as shown in Figure 3 below. The table records the percentage of smokers in Indonesia
                     above the age of 15; most of the smokers are men. Indeed, despite there has been a
                     declining trend since 2010, before 2013 half of Indonesian men are smokers.
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e520">The picture above shows that despite the anti-tobacco campaign, the demand for tobacco
                     in Indonesia continues, although it does not increase sharply. Indonesia continues
                     imports tobacco for the needs of the cigarette industry. Not all of this cigarette
                     production is, of course, for domestic consumption. But the above developments show
                     that, despite the awareness of anti-smoking, domestic demand for cigarettes is relatively
                     stable except for the period 2007 to 2013, for men and it remains stable among women.

                  <p id="d1e525">It is difficult to ascertain that the stability of Indonesia’s tobacco industry and
                     consumption is related to the success or failure of anti-tobacco campaigns. The explanation
                     of this is related to the ambiguous attitude both among the government and the public
                     regarding the anti-tobacco campaign itself which will be explained later in the next
                     section. However, in this section it is important to first look at how Indonesia government
                     tries to internalize anti-smoking norms at the global level into various regulations.
                     In general, it will be seen that the anti-tobacco regulations tend to tighten tobacco
                     consumption, but they also tend to provide flexibility for the survival, if not the
                     expansion of the cigarette industries.
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e527">Indonesia has not signed and ratified FCTC, but Indonesia’s legislation and policies
                     on tobacco control can be traced back to the 1990s. Unlike other countries such as
                     New Zealand, Nigeria, the USA, and Western Australia that explicitly regulate tobacco
                     control, Indonesia uses a comparatively moderate approach to implement anti-tobacco
                     norms. In 1992, under President Soeharto, Indonesia issued Law No. 23 of 1992 on Health,
                     wherein Article 44 regulates addictive substances. Accordingly, the use of addictive
                     substances must not endanger the health of individuals, households, communities, or
                     the environment. Nevertheless, the law does not explain further rules regarding addictive
                     substances. Therefore, several government regulations (GR) were provided to implement
                     the law, including tobacco control [<a href="#R53">53</a>].
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e532">Seven years later, in 1999, Indonesia issued GR No. 81 of 1999 on the "Safety of Smoking
                     for Health" as a follow-up to Law No. 23 of 1992. GR No. 81 of 1999 was the first
                     piece of Indonesian legislation that clearly mentioned tobacco’s dangers. Accordingly,
                     it identified smoking as one of the addictive substances that endangers individuals
                     and societies; hence, the legislation conveyed that it was necessary to implement
                     government oversight of smoking. The original legislation regulated four crucial aspects
                     of tobacco control: nicotine and tar content, cigarette production and sales, cigarette
                     promotion and advertisement, and smoking-free areas. Nevertheless, GR No. 81 of 1999
                     has been amended twice by GR No. 38 of 2000 and GR No. 19 of 2003, amendments that
                     relaxed the aforementioned legislation and again weakened the internalisation of anti-tobacco
                     norms in Indonesia.
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e534">According to GR No. 81 of 1999, the maximum level of nicotine and tar contained in
                     one cigarette (i.e., 1.5 mg and 20 mg, respectively) must be written on the package.
                     The allocated period of adjustment to nicotine regulation and tar is five years for
                     large companies and ten years for small companies. The GR also emphasised that any
                     activities of cigarette production and sales must be conducted only with a permit
                     from the government. Moreover, cigarette advertisements and promotions are allowed
                     as long as they are limited to print media or outdoor areas. The GR also obliged tobacco
                     companies to inform consumers of the dangers of tobacco use in their advertisements.
                     Lastly, GR No. 81 of 1999 encouraged the designation of public areas such as public
                     transports, prayer rooms, and children’s areas (e.g., playgrounds) as smoking-free
                     zones [<a href="#R54">54</a>].
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e539">GR No. 81 of 1999 was first amended by GR No. 38 of 2000. Several crucial elements
                     were changed, especially those related to regulations on nicotine and tar content
                     and also regarding the maximum adjustment period to conform to such regulations. While
                     GR No. 81 of 1999 obligated large cigarette companies to adjust with the regulation
                     on nicotine and tar maximum in five years, GR No. 38 of 2000 prolonged the time of
                     adjustment to up to seven years. It could be said that the amendment was profitable
                     to large cigarette companies. Moreover, diverging from GR No. 81 of 1999, GR No. 38
                     of 2000 allows for promotions and advertisements to be delivered not only in print
                     media and outdoor areas but also via electronic media from 9.30 p.m. to 05.00 a.m.

                  <p id="d1e544">The second amendment of GR No. 81 of 1999 was GR No. 19 of 2003. The amendment provides
                     rule flexibility for tobacco industries since the GR eliminates the regulations limiting
                     the maximum amount of nicotine and tar in cigarettes and removes the deadline to adjust
                     nicotine and tar regulations. The amendments have gradually created a setback in anti-tobacco
                     norm implementation in Indonesia. As a result, tobacco industries enjoy flexibilities
                     and facilities for their production, promotion or advertisement, and sales [<a href="#R56">56</a>].

                  <p id="d1e549">Differences in views among the government agencies, resulted in the formulation of
                     inconsistent regulations. GR No. 81 of 1999 showed the nation’s high willingness to
                     implement smoking control. However, it was then amended by GR No. 38 of 2000 and GR
                     No. 19 of 2003, both of which weakened anti-tobacco norm implementation. In contrast,
                     recent legislation on health, namely Law No. 36 of 2009, seeks to increase anti-tobacco
                     norm internalisation by clearly regulating tobacco consumption. Article 113 of the
                     law regulates tobacco as an addictive substance that poses dangers individuals, households,
                     communities, and the environment. Therefore, the use of tobacco products is now under
                     the control and license of the government. At the local level, the law also obligates
                     local governments to regulate smoking-free areas, including public health facilities,
                     schools, playgrounds, places of worship, public transport, workspaces, and other spaces
                     [<a href="#R57">57</a>]. Compared to the previous legislation, Law No. 36 of 2009 reflects a serious effort
                     to internalise anti-tobacco norms in Indonesian legislation. It is supported by the
                     issuance of Law No. 32 of 2010 on Smoking Prohibition. According to the law, there
                     is a penalty fine of up to IDR 200,000,000 (two hundred million rupiah) for those
                     who violate smoking prohibitions in public spaces.
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e554">In addition, tobacco control is directly implemented by raising cigarette prices and
                     taxes such as the excise and cigarette tax. According to Law No. 39 of 2007 concerning
                     Amendment to Law No. 11 of 1995, excise is a state levy imposed on certain goods such
                     as alcohol and tobacco products, including cigarettes, cigars, sliced tobacco, and
                     tobacco leaves. The increase in tobacco product taxes and prices is governed under
                     Ministry of Finance Regulation (<i>Peraturan Menteri Keuangan</i>/ PMK). Table <a href="#Tab1">1</a> shows tobacco product excises in the period of 2012-2020.
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e562">The increase of taxes and prices shapes the final cost of tobacco products at the
                     sales level. Thus, this approach aims to dissuade consumers from buying tobacco products.
                     However, the increase of tobacco product excise for controlling tobacco consumption
                     has led to an increase in illegal cigarette production. According to an interviewee
                     from the Directorate General of Custom and Excise, many small home cigarette industries
                     go bankrupt since they cannot maintain the operational costs of cigarette production
                     and associated taxes. As a result, some of them turn to producing illegal cigarettes.
                     Indeed, since cigarette prices are relatively high, local people make their own smoking
                     goods using tobacco leaves and other ingredients. It is clear that Indonesia remains
                     in need of more comprehensive, serious law enforcement of tobacco control.

                  <p id="d1e635">Tobacco control, moreover, is not only implemented by the national government but
                     also local governments. It is a mandate of Law No. 36 of 2009 that obligates regional
                     governments to issue their own smoking-free area regulations. For instance, the Jakarta
                     Special Region issued regulation on smoking-free zones in 2010 and was soon followed
                     by other local governments. As a result, by 2020, approximately 77.2% or 397 regencies
                     and cities had issued local regulations on smoke-free areas [<a href="#R63">63</a>].
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e640">Indonesian legislation on tobacco control, including local regulation, has been relatively
                     effective in reducing the use of tobacco. A survey conducted by the Ministry of Health
                     show that increasing percentage of smokers from 2007 to 2010 experienced a gradually
                     decline from 2010 to 2018, as shown in Figure <a href="#Fig4">4</a> [<a href="#R64">64</a>, <a href="#R65">65</a>, <a href="#R66">66</a>, <a href="#R67">67</a>]. This suggests that under the new laws, Indonesia has made progress in the implementation
                     of tobacco control. Nevertheless, the survey also found that the smokers in Indonesia
                     are not only people of working age, as shown in Figure <a href="#Fig4">4</a>, but also children around the age of 10 and the elderly. Furthermore, despite the
                     fact that the number of smokers is less than that of non-smokers, the dangers of tobacco
                     also affect non-smoking people and passive smokers [<a href="#R64">64</a>, <a href="#R65">65</a>, <a href="#R66">66</a>, <a href="#R67">67</a>]. Therefore, the Indonesian Ministry of Health has made attempts to increase tobacco
                     control through regulations of tax and price mechanisms.

                  <p id="d1e673">The optimism surrounding the efficacy of social norms as deterrents to tobacco use
                     becomes difficult to maintain in the Indonesian context. Astuti, et al. argue that
                     tobacco control in Indonesia has shown slow progress due to the country’s political
                     structure and policy hierarchy. Indeed, lack of state effectiveness, a result of unclear
                     powers and responsibilities of governance and corruption, delay the widespread adoption
                     of tobacco control and anti-tobacco culture covering anti-tobacco attitudes and norms

                  <p id="d1e678">The above picture presents a confusing picture of Indonesia’s anti-tobacco regulations.
                     Although recently, with the 2009 government regulation, there were more vigorous efforts
                     to limit tobacco consumption starting from the national level to local government,
                     the cigarette industry in Indonesia is still protected. The government has indeed
                     stepped up its anti-smoking campaign with various regulations including advertising
                     restrictions, but at the same time it has allowed, if not protected, the cigarette
                     industry.

                  <p id="d1e683">The increase of tobacco excises in Indonesia reflects Janus-faced interests for promoting
                     health security on the one hand and economic security on the other hand. While Indonesia
                     seeks to control tobacco through tax and price measures, at the same time, Indonesia
                     also demands funds obtained from tobacco for supporting economic development such
                     as tourism, infrastructures, and the environment. Currently, tobacco has the highest
                     contribution to total excise in Indonesia. There are three elements of taxes in tobacco
                     products, namely excises tax, cigarette tax, and value-added tax (VAT). The cigarette
                     companies pay tobacco products excise to the Directorate General of Custom and Excise
                     based on its number of production, its group, and its type of production, whether
                     machine or hand made. The national government allocates the taxes for funding national
                     development and also supporting regional governments.
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e685">Meanwhile, regional governments manage cigarette tax and other taxes such as the advertisement
                     and promotion of cigarettes. Based on Law No. 28 of 2009, the amount of cigarette
                     tax is 10% of the excise. Moreover, regional governments also receive funds allocated
                     from tobacco products excise by the national government under the scheme of "Revenue
                     Sharing Fund of Tobacco Products Excises" (<i>Dana Bagi Hasil Cukai Hasil Tembakau</i>/ DBHCHT). The Ministry of Finance transfers DBHCHT to all Indonesian provinces, regencies,
                     and cities, including tobacco-producing provinces, tobacco-producing regencies or
                     cities, and non-producer provinces/regencies/cities. From 2010 to 2020, there is an
                     increasing trend of DBHCHT, as shown in Figure <a href="#Fig5">5</a> is due to the increase in excise and tax. East Java which is the biggest producer
                     of tobacco products in Indonesia receives the highest amount of DBHCHT which increase
                     annually [<a href="#R69">69</a>, <a href="#R70">70</a>, <a href="#R71">71</a>, <a href="#R72">72</a>, <a href="#R73">73</a>, <a href="#R74">74</a>, <a href="#R75">75</a>, <a href="#R76">76</a>, <a href="#R77">77</a>, <a href="#R78">78</a>, <a href="#R79">79</a>].

                     </div><img alt="Fig5.png" src="Fig5.png"></div>
                  <p id="d1e742">The Indonesian government also uses funds obtained from tobacco products to support
                     health security. PMK concerning DBHCHT obligates regional governments to allocate
                     at least 50% of the funds to helping the poor access health facilities, promoting
                     health services, upgrading health facilities and equipment, and training medical workers.
                     According to the interviews with officials at the Health Office of Jember, Bondowoso,
                     and Situbondo regencies, DBHCHT supports hospital facilities by buying medical equipment,
                     beds, room facilities, and medicines, and by helping poor people to more easily access
                     health services.
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e744">Furthermore, the allocation of DBHCHT is also for facilitating regional governments
                     to issue regional regulations on smoking-free zones as well as educating people about
                     the danger of tobacco. Nevertheless, despite many regional government’s issuance of
                     regulations on smoking-free zone, the negotiation process is quite hard. According
                     to government officials of Situbondo, Jember, and Bondowoso regencies in the interview
                     session held on September 2020, there are psychological and cultural obstacles to
                     controlling tobacco either at the government or parliament and at the society level.
                     Many parliament and government members who have responsibilities to establish the
                     norm of tobacco control are themselves addicted to smoking. Indeed, at the society
                     level, besides smoking habits being linked to addiction, it is also a part of local
                     culture. As argued by tobacco farmers in these areas, planting tobacco and smoking
                     reflects masculinity and high status. Tobacco in these regencies is part of people’s
                     lives; therefore, it needs a comprehensive approach to convince people to control
                     tobacco use.
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e746">On the other hand, the government also allocates the rest of DBHCHT to promote development,
                     and economic progress relating to job creation, toward which tobacco industries are
                     major contributors [<a href="#R80">80</a>]. It also uses the taxes to promoting good tobacco farm practices, improving infrastructures
                     such as road, market, clean water, sanitation, irrigation, supporting tourism, and
                     improving the environment through waste management [<a href="#R81">81</a>].
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e754">Nevertheless, the data of DBHCT shows that government provides a higher amount of
                     DBHCHT to regencies or cities wherein cigarette companies operate instead of tobacco-farming
                     regencies. For instance, in East Java province, the regencies of Jember, Situbondo,
                     and Bondowoso are the center of tobacco farming; meanwhile, Pasuruan regency does
                     not develop tobacco farming but has cigarette companies in its territory [<a href="#R82">82</a>]. In this context, Pasuruan regency receives a very high amount of DBHCHT compared
                     to Jember, Bondowoso, and Situbondo as shown in Figure <a href="#Fig5">5</a> [<a href="#R69">69</a>, <a href="#R70">70</a>, <a href="#R71">71</a>, <a href="#R72">72</a>, <a href="#R73">73</a>, <a href="#R74">74</a>, <a href="#R75">75</a>, <a href="#R76">76</a>, <a href="#R77">77</a>, <a href="#R78">78</a>, <a href="#R79">79</a>].
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e797">Figure <a href="#Fig6">6</a> below reflects the fact that even though the farmers make contributions to national
                     tobacco industries, tobacco-farming regions receive lower DBHCHT than cigarette-producing
                     regions. In other words, tobacco farmers receive little government support. This is
                     in line with information learned from tobacco farmers in the interview session conducted
                     in September 2020. Accordingly, although there are efforts dedicated to improving
                     tobacco quality as the raw material for tobacco industries, such government programs
                     do not really help the farmers themselves; hence, these efforts do not directly affect
                     tobacco farmers’ welfare. However, farmers continue to grow tobacco because of human
                     resources, experience and traditions of tobacco farming that have been passed down
                     from generation to generation. It is very rare for tobacco farmers to switch to other
                     farms. If the price of tobacco falls, they still have hope that the price of tobacco
                     will improve if demand from abroad increases. Thus, they continue to grow tobacco
                     as the source of support for their livelihoods. Indeed, as summarized by the head
                     of the Pakusari Jember subdistrict, tobacco-growing areas are fully dependent on tobacco,
                     either as farmers or labourers.

            <p id="d1e812">The description of the results of the research above shows the difficulties faced
               in internalizing anti-tobacco norms in Indonesia. In essence, the government is aware
               of the dangers of tobacco to society which has become part of the global health threat.
               It also carries out various regulations, campaigns, and actions to limit tobacco consumption.
               However, the internalization and socialization of these various regulations is not
               an easy thing. The government itself, in addition to providing anti-tobacco awareness,
               wants to ensure that the cigarette industry continues to run. The government enjoys
               a somewhat increasing income every year from cigarette excise which is really needed
               for development in various fields including health.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e814">The government indeed encourages anti-smoking campaigns to reach all regions, pushes
               local governments to make anti-tobacco regulations and continues to campaign for the
               dangers of smoking to the public. But the action was not followed by strict implementations
               of the rules and regulations, even officials tolerate smokers in many places or provide
               special zones if the place is smoke-free.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e816">In various observations and research interviews in the field, the above phenomena
               are widely recognized in the community and interpreted almost uniformly. The public
               generally understands the government’s difficulties and also the difficulties that
               tobacco farmers and tobacco industry workers will face if the anti-smoking campaign
               is carried out consistently. This is coupled with the assumption that tobacco has
               been a farmer’s traditional crop since the colonial era, which make people keep thinking
               that if tobacco is banned, then these farmers will suffer. This kind of meaning gives
               birth to an attitude that tolerates government regulations and policies that seem
               ambiguous, weak, and inconsistent.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e818">Thus, although awareness of the dangers of tobacco uses is widespread in Indonesia,
               the internalization of global anti-tobacco norms will still encounter significant
               obstacles. The widely accepted view about tobacco consumption is certainly not entirely
               true, because tobacco farmers can look for other sources of income. Their economic
               security does not depend only on tobacco farming. Indeed, in certain areas where this
               research was conducted, tobacco is still one of the drivers of the economy. However,
               in the long term, the fate of these farmers is unclear. They do not get significant
               support from the government even though they have contributed to the tobacco industry.
               Their number does not increase, if not decrease. Many farmers depend on tobacco for
               their livelihood because tobacco has become their farming tradition. To increase their
               income, majority of these farmers need to grow crops other than tobacco on their lands
               at different planting times. This can indeed be a solution for the economic security
               of tobacco farmers.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e820">Thus, it is the persistence of the ambivalence view of tobacco that has strengthened
               ambiguity not only among the government but also in society in viewing the smoking
               ban campaigns. As long as this view exists, the anti-tobacco campaigns in Indonesia
               will not be effective because it will meet the fickle attitude of the government and
               society that tolerates smokers. Internalization of anti-smoking norms in such situations
               requires greater government commitment to strengthen anti-smoking campaigns and to
               convince the public that tobacco farmers have other options for making a living.
