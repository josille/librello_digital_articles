                  <p class="first" id="d1e72">Dear Reader,
                     Those among us who have reached a certain age tend
                     to have developed a long-term perspective and inclination
                     to look back on individual years and to compare them for
                     their respective blessings and injuries. In that sense, 2016
                     seems to take a special rank as an annus horribilis not
                     just in my own assessment but in numerous commentaries
                     we have come across over the past weeks. Foremost in
                     our awareness featured the surprises: Nobody in my di-
                     rect acquaintance foretold the Trump phenomenon or the
                     Brexit decision. To find events equally unanticipated and
                     far-reaching, one would have to go back to the 2007/8 finan-
                     cial crash, the 9/11 attacks, the dissolution of the USSR, or
                     the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.
                     How is it that despite unprecedented amounts of metic-
                     ulous study by legions of specialists those events had not
                     been considered even remotely probable? One obvious
                     handicap shared universally to varying degrees is status
                     quo bias. Another factor that surely played a role, and
                     which is still affecting the judgment of many who ought to
                     know better, is the expectation that most people tend to act
                     rationally in their considered self interest or the interests
                     of their peer groups. This expectation persists in some
                     academic disciplines in spite of overwhelming evidence
                     that demonstrates our susceptibility to cultural norms and
                     subconscious impulses as prime determinants of our be-
                     haviour. Despite all rational considerations to the contrary,
                     we seem to cling to the myth that the majority of our peers
                     behave in ways as prudent, informed and precautionary as
                     we consider ourselves to be.
                     The surprise election of Donald Trump, as well as the
                     Brexit decision, also indicates that polls are less reliable
                     
                     than is widely believed. People seem unwilling to admit
                     their true opinion if they perceive it to be in contradiction
                     to what the media have constructed as the majority view.
                     Trump was elected by voters who would not admit their un-
                     willingness to trust governance to a woman, would not own
                     up to their extent of wholesale disaffection with the system
                     as they perceived it, nor to their general unhappiness with
                     the status quo. Other probable contributing factors were
                     the failure of the Obama administration to hold accountable
                     the culprits of the 2008 financial crash, the worsening strat-
                     ification and inequity in US society that is creating a new
                     aristocracy [1], and a distrust in the democratic process.
                     Michael Dobbs, the British author of the TV drama House of
                     Cards, claims that the story of President Trump is already
                     written in its entirety in the works of Shakespeare.
                     The announcement of Trump’s electoral victory was fol-
                     lowed by a surge of ethnocultural violence across the US,
                     and an ominous sounding blog entitled “and so it begins”
                     which really rang true for me. It reminded me of an election in
                     1933, perfectly legitimate and democratic (more so than this
                     last one in the US), which through a simple straightforward
                     majority vote brought a government to power that promised
                     the people relief from the status quo. And so it began. . . only
                     a few years later the same government poured an unprece-
                     dented deluge of suffering on the rest of the world. The
                     first learning opportunity in Trump’s victory as I see it is the
                     deconstruction of the ubiquitous North American sentiment
                     “it can’t happen here”. Well—it can, and now it has.
                     The sobering observation about the abundance of poor
                     judgment among well-informed people also raises the ques-
                     tion of what other ominous events are in store for 2017 and
                     beyond that no analyst worth their money would declare
                     
                     likely. George Monbiot [2] discussed thirteen “impossible‘”
                     future crises that could be considered just as unlikely as the
                     unanticipated events discussed above. They include new
                     crises of national banking sectors, the large-scale loss of
                     jobs to automation, growing nationalist and antidemocratic
                     movements, deterioration of agro-ecosystems and its effect
                     on food availability causing the displacement of millions,
                     and the accelerating loss of species and ecosystems. Not
                     all of those processes are reversible; particularly the lat-
                     ter two derive from ‘ratcheting’ environmental degradation
                     and involve unpredictable tipping points. Monbiot attributes
                     to some of the crises a self-reinforcing property that will
                     result in a rate of change that will take almost everybody
                     by surprise. That is truly frightening because of the unpre-
                     dictable reactions (from unpredictable rulers and others)
                     and knock-on effects that will eventuate.
                     For those who care about human security, the challenge
                     is to acknowledge those disheartening prospects and learn
                     as much as possible as quickly as possible. We are truly
                     entering unknown territory regarding what walls will be built,
                     what wars will be fought, where and how the next human-
                     itarian tragedy will unfold. Much of it will not be new but
                     rather resurrected manifestations of old horrors, albeit in
                     new shapes and new orders of magnitude. The prospect
                     of mass starvation looms larger than ever. The main differ-
                     ence with Trump as president will be that in the absence of
                     prudent preventive measures it will arrive sooner and with
                     more hurtful contingencies. The very fate of this presidency
                     seems less certain than its predecessors; it could deterio-
                     rate prematurely from its own internal weaknesses and lack
                     of competence; its national support base could melt away
                     or simply persist in its role of vilifying and ridiculing ‘Wash-
                     ington’; or the nationwide opposition might coalesce into
                     a movement that brings about not only a new administra-
                     tion but sweeping electoral and political reforms. The wave
                     of protests within the US suggests that such possibilities
                     cannot be dismissed out of hand.
                     One area of research that manages to illuminate the full
                     spectrum of possible futures in the face of uncertainty is the
                     field of scenario studies. The most comprehensive and inclu-
                     sive scenario model I have come across is the one that Paul
                     Raskin and coworkers first proposed in 2002[3]. It includes
                     six basic types of global historical development scenarios
                     (‘Conventional Worlds’, ‘Barbarization’, ‘Great Transitions’),
                     arrived at respectively through the three general pathways of
                     laissez-faire, catastrophic deterioration and proactive reform.
                     The six scenarios can be mutually combined into mixed sce-
                     narios or succeed each other. The underlying assumption,
                     as fundamentally significant as it remains widely unrecog-
                     nised, is that some form of transition to a sustainable future
                     is physically inevitable for humanity. All we can do is nudge
                     the process in one direction or another.
                     Available pathways to such possible futures are comple-
                     mented by strategic prescriptions such as Harald Welzer’s
                     popular book Selbst Denken: Eine Anleitung zum Wider-
                     stand, which translates as “Thinking for Yourself: A Manual
                     for Resistance” (an English translation of the book is 
                     undoubtedly on its way) [4]. Welzer builds on the fundamental
                     fact that human behaviour is first and foremost informed by
                     cultural norms and culturally perpetuated ways of thinking,
                     and only to a minor extent by ‘rational’ considerations or
                     moral exhortations. In spite of the abundant evidence sup-
                     porting this fact, it has not yet found adequate recognition
                     in strategic development initiatives, policy priorities, or edu-
                     cational programs. The obvious consequence is the failure
                     of governments to mount any significant changes to their
                     own policies or to affect people’s behaviour to reduce the
                     collective ecological overshoot.
                     If I had to put money on any of Raskin’s scenarios, it
                     would be Fortress World. The new US president virtually
                     spelled this one out as his personal vision of the future,
                     most probably without realizing the full implications in their
                     environmental, socio-political and historical dimensions.
                     Fortress World features a widespread impoverishment of
                     the world while a few regions manage to seal themselves
                     off and to preserve a high-impact lifestyle. With borders
                     closing and new barriers arising, people will once again
                     mostly stay in one geographical region. This will have a
                     positive effect on emissions but strengthen parochial and
                     xenophobic sentiments. The most forbidding fortresses will
                     be built in people’s minds; their beginnings are evident in
                     public discourse today.
                     Beyond the US, a frightening number of new electoral
                     outcomes, ranging from ultraright nationalists in Europe
                     through Turkey, Poland and the Philippines, indicate that
                     the decline of democracy has become a worldwide trend.
                     In a recent doctoral dissertation, Aydurmus [5] explored the
                     global trends and sentiments that conspire against demo-
                     cratic decision-making. The trends include increasing re-
                     source constraints and population sizes demanding trade-
                     offs that are difficult to implement democratically. Even
                     more difficult to implement are the kinds of restrictions that
                     are necessary to reverse economic growth and to mitigate
                     ecological overshoot. Democratic principles inform means,
                     not ends; elucidating some of those ends requires the ex-
                     pertise of specialists, even though choosing among them
                     should still be left to democratic decision-making. Democ-
                     racy is always limited in the sense that not all of those who
                     are affected by decisions actually have a voice, let alone a
                     vote; this inherent incompleteness can give rise to slippery
                     slope arguments against democracy in principle. Finally,
                     popular preferences tend to favour short-term benefits and
                     easily visualised payoffs and reject necessary sacrifices
                     towards long-term payoffs; in many instances, more democ-
                     racy has not led to more environmental security in a country.
                     Another factor contributing to the declining confidence
                     in democracy is evident in the widespread failure of govern-
                     ments to live up to public expectations as well as to their
                     own promises. The latest major example of governmental
                     failure is the decision by then UK Prime Minister Cameron
                     to call for a popular referendum on Brexit, which turned
                     out to be a monumental misjudgement, bringing his ad-
                     ministration’s agenda to a halt and precipitating Cameron’s
                     resignation. The Brexit decision is likely to create costs to
                     
                     the British taxpayer to the tune of 60 billion euros [2].
                     An entire wave of misjudgements can be expected as
                     a result of the accumulation of incompetence in Trump’s
                     administration [6]. In Welzer’s analysis, the roots of govern-
                     mental failure, even in the hands of competent people, lie
                     in the realisation that, on the one hand, the status quo is
                     becoming increasingly difficult to uphold and, on the other,
                     abandoning status quo ways and means would require sys-
                     temic innovation harbouring unattractive risks and loss of
                     popularity. This dilemma causes much “hectic fiddling” with
                     status quo structures, barely holding ground much of the
                     time and occasionally failing spectacularly. In a communiqu e  ́
                     preceding the 2017 Davos World Economic Forum, it was
                     clearly asserted that the global capitalist economic system
                     is unlikely to survive unless it is substantially revised; I am
                     confident that no such substantial action will be taken, either
                     by the summit powers or any other decision-maker of note.
                     The cumulative effects of successive government fail-
                     ures are evident in Europe’s refugee crisis. Considering how
                     little leadership and organised deliberation on quota and
                     strategies are in evidence, it seems clear that member coun-
                     tries will be unable to mount a concerted response any time
                     soon. In the absence of clear leadership, popular concerns
                     are rising, expediently exploited by those who hope to gain
                     power. The next major wave of refugees can be anticipated
                     as a result of, if not another nearby war, abrupt sea level
                     rise: According to predictions, about fifty million Egyptians
                     from the flooded Nile delta will knock on Europe’s doors.
                     The official reaction, I wager, will be utter surprise [7].
                     The “It will go away—let’s go for a coffee” attitude to-
                     wards serious problems has become apparent in many
                     critical contexts demanding decisive action, ranging from
                     the Greek financial crisis (more loans to tie over the debtors
                     was exactly the wrong thing to do) through climate change,
                     the lost war on drugs, to the appalling mismanagement of
                     the ongoing problems around Fukushima [8].
                     Some of the reasons for the failure of governments in
                     the face of challenges are probably intrinsic to human na-
                     ture. Why is it that individuals and small groups are able
                     to revolutionise the lives and security of generations to
                     come, to the point of winning Nobel prizes, while any larger
                     groups easily deteriorate into mobs with collective intelli-
                     gences akin to that of an earthworm? Politicians whom
                     their system of government obliges to cater to populist incli-
                     nations of large groups must address the lowest common
                     denominator, which is often determined by the low collective
                     intelligence of large groups. Appeals to simplistic interpre-
                     tations of ‘freedom’ and the promise of ‘jobs’ and to fight
                     ‘terrorism’ [9] have worked well in the pro-Trump electorate,
                     while explanations for necessary restrictions would have
                     been pointless and dangerous for his campaign.
                     While these observations support some of the chal-
                     lenges raised against democracy [5], they do not suffice
                     towards a justification for autocracy, as Thomas Jefferson al-
                     ready pointed out. One reason is that even autocrats strive
                     for popular approval; those of them who do not, risk being
                     deposed by those who do. Doling out bread and games is
                     
                     a favourite on both sides. While they are likely to assuage
                     pro-Trump voters disaffected with the status quo, bread
                     and games are less likely to work with the protesting side
                     because they express their concerns in less materialistic
                     terms. What unites and energises their cause is a concern
                     for human rights. For as long as they are perceived to own
                     that concern they will retain the moral high ground. While
                     the fate of the Occupy movement suggests that superior
                     morals is not sufficient for lasting success, this new protest
                     movement benefits from a continuous supply of easy tar-
                     gets provided to them by their opponents, targets that are
                     readily framed in terms of human rights demands.
                     History has shown on several dramatic occasions the
                     power of human rights as an ideological propellant to en-
                     able popular protest movements to topple hegemonic power
                     structures. However, the advent of the Anthropocene has
                     changed the context of human rights. For the first time in
                     human history we are encountering global constraints that
                     render certain rights ungrantable, including all those whose
                     realisation depends on limited physical resources. Elsewhere
                     [10] we have argued that insisting on ungrantable rights weak-
                     ens the general power of human rights argumentation.
                     A case in point regards the ungrantable right to unlimited
                     human reproduction: On 29 October 2015 China officially
                     discontinued its one child policy that had been in force since
                     1979, preventing about 400 million births. Media responses
                     focused on reproductive human rights and amounted to no
                     more than “too little, too late”. Over the years, the critical
                     comments on the Policy followed a predictable humanist-
                     libertarian line that ignored the actual population issue and
                     vehemently proclaimed its purported human rights viola-
                     tions. Analysts seem preoccupied with the demographic
                     consequences of an aging Chinese population, true to the
                     dominant ideology that emphasises economic concepts
                     and values over ecological ones, an ideology that still has
                     not come to grips with global environmental change and
                     systemic limits to growth, four decades after the seminal
                     book on the subject was published. Acknowledging that
                     population reduction cannot fix environmental problems in
                     the short term [11], I assert its paramount importance as a
                     long term determinant of our future.
                     Fortunately, the kinds of human rights invoked by the anti-
                     Trump side are largely of the grantable kind, including gender
                     equity, distributive justice, anti-racism and anti-imperialism.
                     For the time being, the moral high ground appears to be
                     safely in their possession. The next stage of their radicali-
                     sation would need to include the experience of their group
                     efficacy, according to Welzer. Their opponent is likely to
                     stoke the flames by criminalising dissent and protest.
                     In the short term, the rise of Trump-style ultra-right na-
                     tionalism is likely to reduce government support for Transi-
                     tion initiatives, control of corporate excess and hegemony,
                     and general de-growth and mitigation. From a human secu-
                     rity perspective this is no good news, despite the incessant
                     promises of those populist leaders to secure national bor-
                     ders, to make migrants disappear and to ensure universal
                     employment. What will suffer under their leadership are
                     
                     the other pillars of human security, most of all their environ-
                     mental support base. Adaptation and retreat will dominate
                     official policies as the world slides less and less controllably
                     towards catastrophic climates and shortages, bursting eco-
                     nomic bubbles and ever larger numbers of displaced people.
                     In the short term, mitigative countermeasures under such
                     regimes will be confined to autonomous initiatives of subcul-
                     tures and interest groups, local collaborations, community
                     initiatives – united by their counterhegemonic focus. But
                     even beyond such autocratic regimes, more democratic
                     governments tend to fail as well, as we have pointed out.
                     In the longer term, and in view of the general plan-
                     etary trends marking the Anthropocene, the ideological
                     orientation of governments will make less difference than
                     their actual accomplishments. Beyond the question which
                     of Raskin’s scenarios might gain prominence lies the un-
                     certain fate of the ecosphere and its reduced capacity for
                     supporting the human species. Human impacts and the re-
                     sulting accelerating ecocide will be the overall determinant
                     of prospects for human security for the remainder of the
                     century. For the first time last fall I read somebody asserting
                     “forget 350!”. They are of course correct; it was a faint hope
                     
                     all along. But the ramifications of this insight should be
                     more widely explicated, along with the disclaimer. The race
                     between what tends to pass for ‘sustainable development’
                     and population growth is still not widely acknowledged. A
                     recent report in Nature Communications [12] celebrates the
                     finding that our collective ecological footprint has increased
                     at a lower rate than has the global human population –
                     hardly a major collective accomplishment but probably coin-
                     cidental with emerging shortages. Two new reports by the
                     Bertelsmann Stiftung in 2016 specify the SDG Indices for
                     many countries, detailing their performances on all seven-
                     teen goals and their subtargets. No mention at all is made
                     of population growth or ecological overshoot. I feel increas-
                     ingly like a spectator watching a house on fire while the fire
                     service, i.e. governments everywhere, blows hot air instead
                     of water into it. In the midst of that emotion, watching the
                     world’s reaction to the Trump inauguration appeared to me
                     as a ray of hope, for now.
                     Best wishes for a peaceful 2017,
                     Sabina
