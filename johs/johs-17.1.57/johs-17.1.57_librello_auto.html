                                 during and after irregular migration. Based on narrative interviews with mothers residing
                                 in Melbourne, we analyse how their needs both do and do not fall into Nussbaum’s capabilities
                                 list. We argue that Nussbaum’s framework is not sufficient to capture the gendered
                                 aspects of everyday security related to carework. Based on this analysis, we suggest
                                 a new framework to understand carework and everyday security in the context of refugee
                                 and asylum-seeking women. Centring carework in the discussion of the everyday security
                                 of people seeking asylum is a significant step away from traditional security literature
                                 and allows mothers’ voices to be highlighted in a unique way.&nbsp;</span></div>

                              <p id="d1e92">Some refugee and asylum-seeking women make dangerous irregular journeys to pursue
                                 security for themselves and their children that they are denied in their home countries.
                                 The carework mothers perform during these extreme states of insecurity are an exercise
                                 of agency that academia often overlooks in literature around irregular migration.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e94">Security is a term traditionally associated with, and for, state conduct [<a href="#R1">1</a>, <a href="#R2">2</a>]. More recently, security of the individual has come into common parlance in the
                                 literature in the form of human security. However, feminist critique of human security
                                 contends that this perspective is masculine and individualistic in nature [<a href="#R3">3</a>, <a href="#R4">4</a>]. Feminist security studies argues that security needs to be understood in terms
                                 of emancipation, justice and the everyday experiences of human beings [<a href="#R1">1</a>, <a href="#R5">5</a>]. This article applies this understanding of security to the experiences of refugee
                                 and asylum-seeking mothers which is gendered in nature and is intertwined with the
                                 multifaceted nature of motherhood itself.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e115">In this paper, we use ‘‘everyday security’’ as a comprehensive term that evokes freedom
                                 from, or resilience against, harm in daily life [<a href="#R6">6</a>]. It is used in a broad sense within this paper to reorient traditional notions of
                                 security away from state actors and gender-neutral, albeit largely masculine notions
                                 of individuality, to examine how security projects affect the lived experiences of
                                 people. In relation to marginalised gendered experiences, exploring the everyday does
                                 not connote normality or evoke comfort, but instead intends to frame an understanding
                                 of the risks and issues people face on a daily basis in a changing environment where
                                 security concerns are constantly shifting.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e120">Understanding everyday security, including how mothers augment and resist state power
                                 and its practicalities, is crucial in examining how refugee and asylum-seeking mothers
                                 navigate constant insecurity due to state security projects that directly affect their
                                 daily lives. In examining everyday security, this paper does not discuss how mothers
                                 might obtain a predictable and stable life, but instead highlights the volatility
                                 of everyday concerns that refugee and asylum-seeking mothers must navigate for themselves,
                                 and how their own security is intertwined with their children. While everyday security
                                 is a concern central to all mothers’ lives, the everyday before, during, and after
                                 irregular journeys of refugee and asylum-seeking mothers is particularly complicated.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e122">Carework is marginalised within mainstream scholarly work, often framed as a ‘‘private’’
                                 rather than public issue [<a href="#R7">7</a>, <a href="#R8">8</a>, <a href="#R9">9</a>, <a href="#R10">10</a>]. In recent work around family violence, there has been a renewed focus on private
                                 household as an area of public concern. For example, literature suggests the effects
                                 of family violence need to be viewed with the same level of public outrage as terrorism,
                                 given the harm family violence causes to society. The lens of the private as public
                                 validates the importance of mothers’ carework as a public issue and a concern of the
                                 state, instead of being relegated to the private, domestic sphere.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e136">This paper firstly shows how dimensions of gendered carework are components of mothers’
                                 everyday security at all stages of the migration process. It then draws on Nussbaum’s
                                 capabilities framework, which goes beyond the idea of a basic human rights framework
                                 to show what is needed to gain everyday security, to analyse refugee and asylum-seeking
                                 women’s experiences of carework and security.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e138">Through this analysis, this paper posits that Nussbaum’s framework is not sufficient
                                 to capture mothers’ experience of security in the context of the migratory process.
                                 While capabilities are individualistic in nature, the paper examines how security
                                 is not always individualistic. This highlights that it is impossible to universalise
                                 experiences of oppression to encapsulate all women. Analysis often does not take into
                                 account class, racial, cultural, and ethnic diversity, and how these factors contribute
                                 to women’s experiences [<a href="#R11">11</a>, <a href="#R12">12</a>]. A universalist feminist approach is problematic, as it does not account for the
                                 gendered specifics of what security looks like for women [<a href="#R11">11</a>, <a href="#R13">13</a>, <a href="#R14">14</a>, <a href="#R15">15</a>, <a href="#R16">16</a>]. These issues are central to the narratives of refugee and asylum-seeking mothers
                                 whose life experiences do not reflect the same needs of all women.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e162">Much of the literature on refugee and asylum-seeking women emphasises their immediate
                                 needs for critical assistance at various points of crisis. Carework is often ignored
                                 using human rights crisis framework. However, motherhood and carework span these two
                                 categories as mothers navigate crisis while attempting to perform everyday mothering
                                 work in varying state of precariousness. Both Nussbaum’s framework and much of the
                                 literature on refugee and asylum-seeking women do not take into account the dimensions
                                 of carework. This calls for a new framework for understanding the role of carework
                                 in everyday security for refugee and asylum-seeking mothers.

                                       security literature makes current approaches ill-equipped to deal with the daily issues
                                       associated with security that apply to refugee and asylum-seeking mothers. In other
                                       words, security operates from a statist and masculine frame that cannot account for
                                       the everyday experiences faced by mothers that are agentic in nature, and not a just
                                       a series of victimisations at specific crisis points. To encompass fluctuating experiences
                                       and performances of agency, it is necessary to reach beyond a simplistic understanding
                                       of a mother’s basic needs.

                                       mothers, which emphasises fundamental human entitlements that extend past the mere
                                       naming of rights of individuals to identify whether those rights can in fact be secured
                                       [<a href="#R17">17</a>]. The capabilities literature makes the connection between rights and what is necessary
                                       to address needs regarding everyday security [<a href="#R18">18</a>, <a href="#R19">19</a>, <a href="#R20">20</a>]. The capabilities framework emphasises whether or not individuals have the capacity
                                       to achieve their own needs rather than relying on others for their provision [<a href="#R20">20</a>].

                                       the ability for the individual to achieve them. Additionally, capabilities bridge
                                       some of the gaps experienced by women at the public and private divide by including
                                       emotional attachment free of fear, reproductive choices and security against assault.

                                       to human rights, is that it provides a framework to analyse insecurity that exists
                                       despite protection guaranteed by law. An example is places where access to the political
                                       process is guaranteed by law, yet women remain harassed, threated, or attacked if

                                       including marginalised rural Chinese schoolgirls who later became internally migrating

                              <p id="d1e220">The data in this paper is derived from narrative interviews conducted over a one-year
                                 period (2016) with refugee and asylum-seeking mothers from Afghanistan and Iran who
                                 resided in Melbourne, Australia. Although the data was collected five years ago, the
                                 precarity of the situation for people seeking asylum in Australia has remained largely
                                 unchanged. This leads us to believe that the aspects of insecurity discussed by the
                                 participants about their experiences before, during and after the migratory processes
                                 remain relevant today.

                              <p id="d1e222">Interviewees were identified using a snowball sampling technique [<a href="#R21">21</a>, <a href="#R22">22</a>], which resulted in interviews being conducted with 19 mothers from Afghanistan and
                                 Iran who were asylum seekers or had refugee status and were living in the Melbourne
                                 metropolitan area. We spoke with eight Iranian women and eleven Afghan women in total,
                                 mostly with the assistance of an interpreter, although two Iranian women communicated
                                 in English. Interviewees ranged between 24 to 50 years-of-age and had from one to
                                 seven children whose ages ranged from under one year to 21 years. The majority of
                                 the women (18) arrived in Australia between 2011 and 2016, except one Afghan woman
                                 who arrived in 2007.

                              <p id="d1e230">Nine women entered Australia by boat, while ten entered by plane. The sample also
                                 included women who had spent time in onshore and/or offshore detention centres reopened
                                 in 2010 by the Gillard government (9). Fifteen women travelled only with their children,
                                 while four travelled with their children and partner. Three were pregnant during their
                                 journeys. We have created pseudonyms for participants and their children to protect
                                 anonymity.

                              <p id="d1e232">The criteria for participation were flexible regarding the visa type and status of
                                 each woman’s refugee application. Some mothers had already received refugee status
                                 before arriving while others were awaiting determination on their permanent residency
                                 status in Australia. All women undertook an irregular journey into transit countries
                                 to the host country, or both. We recruited women from Afghanistan and Iran as they
                                 were the most likely to have been involved in irregular travel into Australia via
                                 boat according to government statistics [<a href="#R23">23</a>]. For example, between 2008 and 2013, the total number of asylum seekers from these
                                 countries who arrived in Australia by boat was 11,513 and 7,708 respectively [<a href="#R23">23</a>], although available government reports do not provide information about the sex
                                 of those leaving specific countries. We chose 2007 as a commencement date for arrival
                                 because of substantial changes to asylum-seeker and refugee policies during this year,
                                 including the closure of Australia’s offshore detention centres [<a href="#R24">24</a>].

                              <p id="d1e243">The women with whom we spoke were delineated by mode of entry and country of origin.
                                 The majority of mothers we spoke to from Afghanistan spent significant time in transit
                                 countries, mainly Pakistan, after they fled their home country. Afghan mothers who
                                 spent extended periods in Pakistan identified poverty and a lack of legal status as
                                 major stressors on their carework roles. Many had no saved money before fleeing Afghanistan.
                                 In most cases, their husbands attempted the boat journey to Australia, so mothers
                                 were responsible for all carework and providing household income.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e245">Pakistan is also not a signatory of the United Nations (UN) Refugee Convention, so
                                 the UN High Council on Refugees conducts the refugee status determination, which is
                                 a lengthy and complex process. All bar one of the Afghan women we spoke to had arrived
                                 in Australia by plane on a partner’s humanitarian visa after spending years in Pakistan.
                                 However, the humanitarian visa provided these women with permanent visa status, access
                                 to welfare benefits and the right to work upon arrival. This was not the case for
                                 the Iranian women with whom we spoke, as all were living in the community on temporary
                                 or bridging visas after undertaking the journey through transit countries and by boat
                                 to Australia.

                              <p id="d1e247">During the interviews, we prompted women to reflect on their roles as mothers before,
                                 during, and after their irregular border crossings. The narrative interview was used
                                 to promote everyday conversational interaction, by way of story-telling and listening,
                                 to produce data [<a href="#R21">21</a>] about the things that mattered in these women’s lives [<a href="#R25">25</a>] and to develop an understanding of how each participant constructs their identity
                                 [<a href="#R26">26</a>]. This approach centres on discovering marginalised voices to challenge normalised
                                 or silenced discourses of the accounts of everyday security for women as mothers and
                                 carers, rather than focusing on victimisation that women may have experienced during
                                 their journeys. In other words, the emphasis on motherhood created a space of agency
                                 for mothers to guide the interviews around experiences of security, self, and children.
                                 The semi-structured narratives driven by the participants allowed the interviews to
                                 be placed within mothers’ comfort zones, and provided the opportunity to explore themes
                                 and discuss experiences that were most important for them [<a href="#R25">25</a>, <a href="#R26">26</a>, <a href="#R27">27</a>].

                                 which a myriad of other everyday security needs fell. These were 1. Basic Needs; 2.
                                 Bodily Security; 3. Isolation/Separation; and 4. Increased Carework. While other related
                                 needs existed, these four categories of everyday security allow for a discussion of
                                 mothers’ agency during their journeys to manage a variety of interrelated needs. These
                                 needs were experienced to various extents in their home country, transit country,
                                 during the boat journey, in detention centres and in their host country.

                                       shelter. The basic need is expanded in the host country to include capability number
                                       10, which is control over one’s own environment. The capability addresses both the

                                    <p id="d1e302">Bodily security falls under several needs (1, 2 and 3) before, during, and after migration.
                                       The first capability is life and encompasses the right to normal life expectancy for
                                       an individual. The second is bodily health. The third is bodily integrity which addresses
                                       movement of self, as well as security against assault, including sexual assault and
                                       family violence. The opportunity for sexual satisfaction and choices regarding reproduction
                                       is also part of this category. Bodily security is not included in the host country,
                                       as this capability did not come up in mothers’ narratives about their Australian experience.
                                       The fact that it did not emerge is likely indicative of increased security for women
                                       within Australia in comparison with their home or transit countries.

                              <p id="d1e468">This conceptaulisation of everyday security that centres carework can be applied in
                                 a number of other realms such as family violence, reproductive rights, and other issues
                                 where women are or should be at the heart of discussions around security. In a recent
                                 report by Zufferey et al. (2016) they describe how family violence affected women’s
                                 everyday security in various ways. Mothers who were victims of family violence were
                                 found to have decreased work hours and lower positions in their jobs, less stable
                                 housing after leaving a partner, high instances of diagnosed mental illness during
                                 or after family violence, and lower social participation during instances of family
                                 violence [<a href="#R9">9</a>]. Women described how the increased responsibility of caring for children due to
                                 family violence affected their ability to work and socialise. A security frame that
                                 incorporates these consequences identifies what is at stake for mothers in situations
                                 of violence and liminal citizenship in the everyday.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e473">By addressing pressures on carework, we also identify the issues that can be addressed
                                 to aid mothers in obtaining everyday security. State action and inaction in regarding
                                 the needs of refugees and asylum seekers has lead directly to pressures discussed
                                 by mothers in their narratives [<a href="#R2">2</a>]. In fact, there are circumstances where the mother must act in lieu of state, as
                                 the needs associated with having children and undertaking carework go unaddressed.
                                 The centring of carework also highlights the inadequencies of Australia’s onshore
                                 and offshore detention systems. Australian detention centres are not mother- and child-sensitive
                                 [<a href="#R2">2</a>]. For example, children are born on mainland Australia without citizenship because
                                 pregnant women are brought from offshore detention centres that have no capability
                                 for pre- and post-natal care [<a href="#R23">23</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e484">It is essential to recognise that our conclusions intend to privilege the voices and
                                 needs of the refugee and asylum-seeking mothers. In creating this diagram, we are
                                 attempting to address the lack of security focus of these mothers. We acknowledge
                                 there are many barriers to achieving change, and some will most certainly receive
                                 more political resistance than others, while others are not likely to be politically
                                 achievable at all given the current worldwide stance on sovereign control of borders.
