                              <p id="d1e84">Public insecurity has long impeded the effective governance of Rio de Janeiro.
                                 Historical State [<a href="#R10">10</a>] abandonment of Rio’s favelas (informal settlements), coupled with these territories
                                 being dominated by criminal gangs over the past several decades, has gradually come
                                 to almost completely disenfranchise people living in favelas. In addition, state military
                                 incursions and inter-gang warfare have created a scenario whereby many favelas resemble
                                 full-blown internal armed conflict zones.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e89">With Rio’s successful bid to host the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics it became a
                                 political priority for the city to overcome its hyper-violent reputation and rebrand
                                 itself as a desirable, international tourist destination. A new public security campaign—the
                                 <i>Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora</i> (UPP or police pacification campaign)—was crafted and launched as a result [<a href="#R01">1</a>]. Established in 2008, the UPP has, to date, deployed more than 9,500 police officers
                                 to ‘pacify’ 38 favelas located close to affluent neighborhoods, hotels, tourist spots,
                                 and mega-event venues (<a href="#FIG1">Figure 1</a> ) [<a href="#R02">2</a>]. The remaining 700+ favelas of Rio have not been affected by pacification. Many
                                 continue to be governed by armed criminal gangs.

                                 agenda in relation to developing the city as an international mega-events venue. It
                                 contends that many of the ways in which this plays out is explicative of what David
                                 Harvey refers to as ‘accumulation by dispossession’ [<a href="#R05">5</a>], and indicative of what James Freeman defines as a case of state engineering aimed
                                 at controlling territory through military occupation in order to capture assets by
                                 force and produce channels for the expansion of private capital [<a href="#R06">6</a>].

                              <p id="d1e138">The paper aims to illuminate on this position by presenting case reports on three
                                 of Rio de Janeiro’s pacified favelas. The reports aim to describe the social infrastructure
                                 contributions the UPP has made to these communities, and moreover, how the UPP is
                                 a framework that uses military occupation to facilitate these and other urbanization
                                 projects; how these projects benefit private development interests that are tied to
                                 mega-events; and how people living in favelas are being affected in the process.

                                 and theoretical underpinnings of pacification, and how this applies in the case of
                                 Rio de Janeiro. It goes on to examine how pacification is advancing in three favelas
                                 under UPP control, and describes how this relates to economic development, urbanization
                                 and regularization activities. It scrutinizes what impact these policies are having
                                 on the people living in favelas, and on the formal neighborhoods that surround them.
                                 In particular, the research aims to review social, economic, and security indicators
                                 in relation to the UPP in general, and more specifically, in the three pacified communities
                                 discussed.

                                 in Brazil’s favelas. It then delineates the theoretical foundations of pacification.
                                 It goes on to provide a general overview of how Rio’s policing efforts connect to
                                 the international ‘war on drugs’, and of the struggles the UPP faces in relation to
                                 violence, corruption, and morale. The economic drivers of pacification are then explored—how
                                 police operate to support state-sponsored expansion of private development interests,
                                 and how these activities, and rapid urbanization in general, are supported through
                                 legislation. An assessment of the security landscape then provides a precursor to
                                 the three case reports. Each case report provides a different example of how favela
                                 residents are being confronted by pacification. A summary of the case reports then
                                 analyzes the UPP’s impact in the favelas. In conclusion, the paper expands on how
                                 the UPP, under the guise of public security policy, is advancing processes of accumulation
                                 by dispossession, and outlines some alternative approaches to government intervention
                                 and informality.

                              <p id="d1e180">Rio has always been a city characterized by social fragmentation. From the time it
                                 became a vast Portuguese colony in the 16<sup>th</sup> century until the abolition of slavery in 1888—Rio de Janeiro was the center of a
                                 great slave regime [<a href="#R07">7</a>]. Today, it remains deeply marred by this heritage.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e188">Approximately a quarter of the population—more than 1.5 million people [<a href="#R08">8</a>]—live in the favelas and irregular housing settlements that started to spring up
                                 after the abolition of slavery, and that now define much of the dramatic look and
                                 feel of the city.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e193">The people living in these favelas are extraordinarily resilient and highly adaptive.
                                 In a climate of poverty and state neglect, they have independently built, administered
                                 and created governing structures for hundreds of communities—some of which are occupied
                                 by tens of thousands of people and considered cities in themselves. These communities
                                 have complex infrastructures, including their own systems for land title exchanges,
                                 roads, churches, schools, residential neighborhoods, commercial areas, charities,
                                 mail delivery systems, businesses, transportation services, and utilities networks.
                                 
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e195">The people of the favelas have been historically active in forming pro-democracy networks,
                                 residential associations, and labor unions [<a href="#R09">9</a>], and for shaping much of the rich culture for which Brazil is internationally renowned.
                                 They also provide much of the cheap informal labor needed to keep the formal city
                                 functioning—the doormen, garbage collectors, construction workers, nannies, cooks,
                                 and cleaners.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e200">The metaphor of segregation is often used to describe the social and economic divide
                                 seen across the city, one of Latin America’s most unequal. Residents either live in
                                 the ordered and often luxurious and tranquil comfort of the <i>asfalto</i> (formal neighborhoods), or in the chaotic and frenetic disquiet of the favelas. The
                                 contrast between the two is stark. Thus, Rio remains a city largely characterized
                                 by a great disparity in wealth and privilege.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e205">Even though an image of racial democracy is often promoted, it is Brazil’s ruling
                                 elite who remain in control of its narrative, and who continue to ignore those excluded
                                 from the bourgeoisie. Social scientist, Dr. Jorge da Silva (Rio’s former State Military
                                 Police Chief of Staff), stresses that this ought to be taken into consideration when
                                 attempting to understand Rio society, and by extension when discussing public security
                                 policy and the insolvent relationship between the State and favela residents [<a href="#R11">11</a>].

                              <p id="d1e213">The term pacification is historically associated with the activities of colonization—activities
                                 that are intricately woven into the fabric of Brazilian history [<a href="#R12">12</a>] and, in Rio de Janeiro, are linked to counterinsurgency campaigns [<a href="#R13">13</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e221">Pacification theoretically connects to an industrious component that aims to build
                                 social order along with law and order. According to the official narrative, pacification
                                 in Rio de Janeiro is based on a military campaign that aims at constructing the social
                                 through urbanization projects connected to mega-events [<a href="#R14">14</a>]. This rhetoric is socially engineered [<a href="#R15">15</a>]—wrapped up in the language of the ‘war on drugs’, ‘public security’, ‘integration’,
                                 and ‘economic development’—and delivered through a convincing media campaign that,
                                 while presenting itself as a strategy for improving favela communities, in reality
                                 focuses on securing public support for military actions that strengthen economic expansion
                                 [<a href="#R16">16</a>]. The manufacture of order through military suppression—or what critical theorist
                                 Mark Neocleous calls “war as peace [and] peace as pacification” [<a href="#R17">17</a>]—is attached to an end goal of providing security for the bourgeois social order
                                 for the purposes of capital accumulation [<a href="#R15">15</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e238">Pacification in Rio, therefore, can be seen as a politically crafted, military response
                                 to the social insecurity felt by Rio’s upper middle- and elite classes, not to rising
                                 criminal insecurity. The author argues that while pacification does provide some small
                                 social benefits to Rio’s favela constituencies, moreover, it is a core political approach
                                 of a neoliberal government that selectively and aggressively uses military occupation
                                 and takeover to secure vulnerable regions of social space for the primary reason of
                                 increasing capital accumulation [<a href="#R18">18</a>].

                              <p id="d1e246">The military procedure of pacification follows basic steps. First, Special Forces
                                 invade a targeted favela en masse. Police Pacifying Units (UPPs), then set up military
                                 posts inside the favela to control the newly secured territory. It is a difficult
                                 task. They have to hold territory where drug culture is not eradicated but merely
                                 concealed, and where traffickers shift their ground rather than lose it. They may
                                 drive visibly armed criminals out of pacified areas, but in doing so displace them
                                 to areas that are not pacified. After a time, trafficking also tends to reestablish
                                 itself as it adapts to operating inside pacified territory, a situation that often
                                 relies on police collusion.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e248">The police are an easy target for corruption. The complex system in which drug-related
                                 and other criminal activities feed on police corruption and criminal complicity now
                                 permeates Brazil’s political arena—with drug money used to finance politicians and

                                 highest levels [<a href="#R19">19</a>].

                                 ‘war on drugs’, has exacerbated urban violence. Dr. da Silva points out that while
                                 the Global North fights drug consumption through legislation in its own nations, countries
                                 such as Brazil are tasked with the real war of militarized combat aimed at eradicating
                                 drug culture (production, distribution channels and local cartels) [<a href="#R11">11</a>]. This is indeed the case in Rio de Janeiro. Clashes between security forces and
                                 drug traffickers in the favelas have been likened to the military operations being
                                 carried out in places like Afghanistan [<a href="#R13">13</a>]. As Marcelo Burgos points out, Rio continues to tackle the problem of drug trafficking
                                 in favelas using the war metaphor, through aggressive military confrontation that
                                 results in civilian casualties and mistrust of the government, and their ability to
                                 manage or reduce violent crime [<a href="#R20">20</a>]. These operations signal a legitimization of the forceful containment of violence,
                                 potentially impede democracy [<a href="#R21">21</a>], and tends to resign residents to the inevitability of being governed by drug traffickers.

                                 them. Since pacification, Rio has seen an explosion of militias (security and ex-security
                                 forces who control favela territory in a way similar to gangs). In 2004 there were
                                 six militias operating throughout the metropolitan area. In 2014, there were 148 [<a href="#R22">22</a>]. Police have also been heavily criticized for violence, torture, unlawful killings
                                 and cover-ups [<a href="#R23">23</a>], and several UPP commanders have been removed due to their involvement in corruption
                                 scandals [<a href="#R24">24</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e278">Many current and former police officers, especially those in militias, have been linked
                                 not only to extortion, but to extra-judicial killings. 16% of homicides registered
                                 since pacification began took place at the hands of on-duty police officers. Of the
                                 1,275 reported killings by these officers between 2010 and 2013, 99.5% victims were
                                 men, 79% were black, and 75% were between the ages of 15 and 29 [<a href="#R25">25</a>]. These killings are rarely investigated.

                              <p id="d1e283">Police in Rio are the most mistrusted and corrupt in the country. 7.2% of the 8,500+
                                 people surveyed throughout the metropolitan area claim they have been extorted by
                                 police officials. This figure constitutes 30% of all extortion victims nationally
                                 [<a href="#R26">26</a>]. Dismally low police wages also makes drug trafficking an attractive prospect. In
                                 December 2012 alone, some 59 Rio military police were arrested for running an alleged

                              <p id="d1e291">Police morale is generally low. The UPP program, in particular, suffers from a varying
                                 quality of officers, many of who are being deployed to UPPs without wanting to go.
                                 Of 359 police officers interviewed from the first nine UPPs deployed in Rio, 70% said
                                 they would prefer placements in other policing units, and 63% considered their training
                                 inadequate, especially in regards to using non-lethal arms and concerning the reduction
                                 of domestic violence (one of their key mediation duties). In addition, high proportions
                                 of officers believed the UPPs’ principal objectives were ensuring public safety for
                                 the World Cup and Olympic Games and reassuring the middle class. Further, 65% saw
                                 it as a way of guaranteeing support during electoral campaigning. More than half of
                                 the police interviewed noted negative public perceptions, and only a handful regularly
                                 participated in community meetings [<a href="#R28">28</a>].

                              <p id="d1e296">From the onset, the UPP campaign has been rapidly implemented. Now with almost 10,000
                                 officers, some police claim it has grown too quickly. Yet, the overall numbers of
                                 Rio’s security forces are set to expand again, with the expectation that at least
                                 60,000 personnel will be employed to ensure security during the Olympic Games [<a href="#R29">29</a>].

                              <p id="d1e301">R$ 2.5 (US$ 0.6) billion has been dedicated to providing security for the three weeks
                                 of the Olympics—half of the state’s total annual security budget. This excludes the
                                 cost of the UPP—which runs at more than a half billion reals annually (US$ 130 million),
                                 as it currently functions [<a href="#R06">6</a>]. Even if the UPP was able to expand dramatically (an unrealistic scenario given
                                 the current economic downturn), the program will only ever be able to provide security
                                 for a fraction of Metropolitan Rio’s 750+ favelas, suggesting—as is characteristic
                                 of neoliberal governance—that Rio’s public security policy has been produced by and
                                 for specific private interests.

                              <p id="d1e309">David Harvey hypothesizes that capital(ism) is constantly reconfiguring its routes
                                 of circulation and accumulation in order to expand power through ways that are historically
                                 and geographically contingent on an amalgamation of i) the devaluation of existing
                                 assets (through disinvestment, abandonment, annihilation, etcetera); ii) the reinvestment
                                 of surplus capital in promoting economic growth (expanded reproduction); and iii)
                                 rent extraction (leveraging of commodified assets such as labor, land, public utilities,
                                 pension funds, et cetera) [<a href="#R30">30</a>].

                              <p id="d1e314">The releasing, seizing, appropriation, and leveraging of sets of assets at very little
                                 to no cost, at the expense of democratic rights, is basically what Harvey refers to
                                 as accumulation by dispossession [<a href="#R31">31</a>]. These processes tend to happen in areas of uneven geographical development and
                                 lived space, and are dependent on a union between the State and the predatory facets
                                 of finance capital—what Harvey refers to as ‘vulture capitalism’ [<a href="#R05">5</a>]. In Rio, they look very much like Naomi Klein’s idea of ‘disaster capitalism’ [<a href="#R32">32</a>].

                                 came about in 2007 with the signing into law of the Document of Governmental Guarantees
                                 [<a href="#R39">39</a>]—a private adhesion contract with the Fédération Internationale de Football Association

                                 demands without any allowance for negotiation of specific terms. In other words, the

                                 corporate alliances, investors, transactions and investments, in blatant non-compliance
                                 with Brazil’s Federal Constitution [<a href="#R40">40</a>]. This law paved the way for the 2009 adoption of the Olympic Act and the 2012 General

                                 to regulations such as building codes, or adherence to the legal principle of the

                                 of wider public interest.

                                 rights. They expend massive amounts of public funds on militarization; bankroll facilities

                                 set of economic goals laid out by the city as a set of urbanization strategies [<a href="#R50">50</a>] that James Freeman defines as the business of building, preparing and marketing
                                 Rio as a mega-event city: the valorization of real estate, and securing the favelas
                                 as commodities and markets for commodities [<a href="#R06">6</a>]. In other words, pacification is a structure through which public security policy
                                 paves the way for economic expansion through rapid urbanization.

                              <p id="d1e419">The marketing of mega-events is about selling spectacle and image [<a href="#R36">36</a>] in order to build a picture of Rio that will supposedly lead to years of return
                                 on the investment. It is big business, particularly for organizing bodies such as
                                 FIFA and the IOC, which profit from broadcasting rights, corporate sponsorship, product
                                 licensing, and ticket sales.

                                 This image is promoted as the exotic backdrop to the sports drama that unfolds on
                                 screen to billions of viewers to generate tremendous profit. FIFA received approximately
                                 US$ 4 billion in broadcasting fees for the World Cup, the Olympics is expected to
                                 yield about the same [<a href="#R45">45</a>]. In addition, Rio’s local 2016 Olympic Organizing Committee predicts to receive
                                 around US$ 0.5 billion in revenue from its sales of ‘official merchandise’ [<a href="#R52">52</a>].

                              <p id="d1e435">Protecting this painstakingly constructed illusion of the city—as advertised—is of
                                 critical importance. Disruption, and potential disruption of this image (violence,
                                 poverty, protests, et cetera) must be suppressed at all costs. Even the landscape
                                 surrounding the stadiums is of great significance. Olympic promotional material, for
                                 example, never portrays Rio’s Maracanã stadium with the (pacified) Mangueira favela
                                 in the background; and residents of its neighbor—Favela do Metrô—have suffered under
                                 a slew of illegal housing demolitions[<a href="#R53">53</a>] and forced relocations in order to produce a more desirable view [<a href="#R06">6</a>]. Security perimeters are also established to lock down areas surrounding mega-event
                                 venues.

                                 profited from lucrative contracts to provide security equipment and technology to
                                 law enforcement divisions for mega-events. During the World Cup, teams of Armed Forces
                                 and Special Ops troops took control of the neighborhood surrounding Maracanã stadium.
                                 Missiles were placed on the roofs of condominium buildings and the terraces of private
                                 residences. Rio’s new Command and Control Operations Center—in partnership with IBM—coordinated
                                 over 30 agencies in these operations, including the deployment of security forces.
                                 157,000 troops were deployed throughout the country during the event to deter protestors
                                 at a cost of almost US$ 1 billion. Though it is difficult to make an absolute determination,
                                 Brazil’s total Public Works spending surrounding the World Cup and Olympics may cost
                                 as much as US$ 1 trillion [<a href="#R45">45</a>].

                              <p id="d1e448">An array of money-spinning investment opportunities comes with preparing for mega-events.
                                 Rio’s Olympic bid budgeted R$ 29 billion (US$ 7.25 billion) for revitalization of
                                 the city [<a href="#R06">6</a>], though the figure could easily reach three times that amount [<a href="#R54">54</a>]. The extent of redevelopment and the profits it generates for a handful of private
                                 interest groups is enormous. Leading up to the Cup, the rights to run and profit from
                                 five of the country’s airports—including Rio’s Galeão International Airport—were handed
                                 over to four private consortia for a period of 20–25 years [<a href="#R55">55</a>]. The group that secured the rights to run Galeão is led by Odebrecht—Brazil’s (and
                                 Latin America’s) largest closely held construction and engineering firm.

                              <p id="d1e459">Odebrecht also won four World Cup stadium contracts, including the R$ 1 billion renovation
                                 of Rio’s Maracanã stadium, financed with R$ 1.5 billion (US$ 447 million) of taxpayer
                                 money in the form of subsidized loans from Brazil’s state development bank. Odebrecht
                                 is also part of the consortium that manages Maracanã; and one of its subsidiaries,
                                 Mectron, gained one of the hefty defense contracts to upgrade the military equipment
                                 used to secure its perimeter during events [<a href="#R45">45</a>].

                                 its stadium work [<a href="#R56">56</a>], Odebrecht continues to generate some of the largest profits from the orgy of mega-event
                                 construction currently taking place in Rio. It is part of a consortium that is profiting
                                 from the construction of the new R$5 billion Metro extension and the contentious Bus
                                 Rapid Transit lines (BRT)—currently running at 46% over budget [<a href="#R57">57</a>]. Though the BRT has been described as an example of ‘sustainable transport’, professor
                                 of urbanism Chris Gaffney claims the transit lines are designed to boost real estate
                                 speculation around the Olympic transit route while further fragmenting and isolating
                                 the poor [<a href="#R57">57</a>]. These Olympic Legacy projects have resulted in the forced displacement of thousands
                                 of low-income residents, and driven profits through the roof for some of the city’s
                                 largest developers.

                                 The company has seen a “billion dollar jump” in the value of its real estate holdings
                                 in and around the Olympic site at Barra da Tijuca, thanks to Mayor Eduardo Paes, who
                                 has invested billions in public funds to build the infrastructure to enable the US$

                                 and Odebrecht share equal partnership [<a href="#R58">58</a>]. The social cost has been tremendous and includes violent removal of almost the

                                 for a fifteen-year term. Porto Novo is made up of three of Brazil’s largest construction/engineering
                                 firms—Odebrecht, Carioca Engenharia and OAS—which will do the demolition, build the
                                 new infrastructure, and manage Porto Maravilha once it is completed. Federal FGTS
                                 pension funds, controlled by Brazil’s federal public bank, are providing the R$ 8
                                 billion of infrastructure funding for the PPP, even though the pension funds are supposed
                                 to be used to develop social housing [<a href="#R61">61</a>]. The city has evicted most of the 30,000 poorer residents from the port area and

                                 without any participation” to accommodate “specific interests, which cannot be confused

                              <p id="d1e551">The Municipal Institute of Urbanism (Instituto Municipal de Urbanismo Pereira Passos
                                 or IPP) oversees the social administration of the UPP under a division known as the
                                 Rio+Social or UPP Social [<a href="#R75">75</a>]. As described in Rio’s municipal development plan, its function is to coordinate
                                 various municipal agencies to help achieve social and economic development goals [<a href="#R50">50</a>]. Generally, this process occurs at the nexus of pacification, urbanization and mega-events.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e559">The IPP maps municipal data, manages information, and advises on municipal public
                                 policy [<a href="#R76">76</a>]. Specifically, it identifies municipal initiatives for economic investment and advises
                                 on the needs of, and where best to locate social assets. It also coordinates corporate-sponsored
                                 ‘cultural’ events (<a href="#FIG2">Figure 2</a>).

                              <p id="d1e567">Development specialist, Robert Muggah, has criticized the UPP Social program for not
                                 putting emphasis on service delivery, and for its lack of capacity to respond to local
                                 demands [<a href="#R78">78</a>]. The program is far from ineffective, however. IPP Director, Eduarda La Rocque,
                                 admits that the UPP Social services “the priorities…of the city of Rio de Janeiro
                                 as a whole…[not] what the favela wants” [<a href="#R79">79</a>].
                                 
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e575">The IPP is the department that provides the city with the information necessary to
                                 plan and carry out its regularization activities in the favelas. Regularization is
                                 accompanied with promises that registered entrepreneurs and vendors can access the
                                 formal market through being eligible to apply for microcredit and job training provided
                                 by PPPs. To date, however, out of the 1.5 million people the government claims to
                                 have benefited from pacification [<a href="#R02">2</a>], only 2,027 micro-entrepreneurs have been formalized, and only 5,000 have received
                                 access to micro-credit [<a href="#R80">80</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e583">Shock orders also require home and business owners to formally obtain land titles
                                 for their homes or businesses (a five-year heavily bureaucratized process), and/or
                                 licenses for commercial activities (a three day online approval process)—or face being
                                 shut down. Land regularization comes with the cost-of-living increase that property
                                 tax brings. In addition, landowners and tenants alike must manage sudden and sharp
                                 spikes in the cost of utilities and services that regularization brings. These are
                                 many times higher than what is affordable for most favela residents. Electricity prices
                                 alone have jumped 1400% in some favelas (from US$ 20 a month to US$ 299) [<a href="#R81">81</a>]. In this economic climate, even if a favela resident is fortunate enough to have
                                 full-time employment (earning minimum wage of around US$ 225 per month), they will
                                 likely be priced out of their homes.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e588">Though land regularization and urban upgrading are important first steps for integrating
                                 favelas into the formal city, it is important to critique if and how regularization
                                 functions to impact the informal sector. Regularization and slum upgrading are, in
                                 themselves, meager rights to strive for. As urban planner Mark Purcell puts it, “not
                                 just housing but decent and affordable housing, not just jobs but good jobs, not just
                                 transportation but efficient and convenient transportation” [<a href="#R42">42</a>] are necessary to ensure what Lefebvre conceived of as ‘the right to the city’ [<a href="#R82">82</a>]. Regularization in Rio, rather than bringing stability, is bringing financial strain
                                 to an already fragile economic environment.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e596">Another function of the IPP is to identify ‘geo-risk’ housing—those structures vulnerable
                                 to flood, landslide, or collapse. The Mayor’s Morar Carioca slum upgrade program uses
                                 ‘geo-risk’ as a tactic to validate evictions through “the elimination of risk areas
                                 [and the] resettlement of residents”. Even though the program charter guarantees the
                                 right of civil “participation…in all stages”, residents are not consulted in this
                                 process [<a href="#R83">83</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e601">Rio’s evictions in relation to mega-events have directly affected almost 70,000 individuals
                                 [<a href="#R84">84</a>] and put up to 40,000 more at risk [<a href="#R85">85</a>]. The process is being accelerated through a policy of lightning evictions introduced
                                 in 2015 to secure favela property for economic development activities for the Olympics.
                                 The evictions are typically enforced by police who are deployed in legally dubious
                                 maneuvers with operational teams that cut electricity, remove residents, and bulldoze
                                 neighborhoods, sometimes with little to no warning [<a href="#R86">86</a>]. Dispossessed residents and their neighbors are merely left with abandoned piles
                                 of rubble that exasperate threats to health and safety (<a href="#FIG3">Figure 3</a>) [<a href="#R87">87</a>]. Many are unable to resettle in the same neighborhood because of the increase in
                                 the cost of living brought about through pacification.

                                 estate and rental markets in and around favelas. The perceived reduction in crime
                                 associated with the presence of the UPP also drives up the price of real estate both
                                 inside the favelas, and in the surrounding <i>asfalto</i> neighborhoods. This real estate spike has led to an overall increase of approximately
                                 15% across the formal city as a whole between 2008–2011 [<a href="#R19">19</a>]. In favelas, the jump has been as high as 300% [<a href="#R88">88</a>].

                                 and disseminated through various means by scholars, mainstream and independent media,
                                 NGOs, government, and international organizations, reflects the overwhelming challenge
                                 of accurately evaluating the many facets of an ever-evolving pacification campaign
                                 and the urbanization activities related to it.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e660">At first, the results of the UPP occupations seemed positive. Ignacio Cano’s 2012
                                 report, Os Donos do Morro, quantified the program’s impressive impact on registered
                                 crime. Cano showed a dramatic drop in homicide rates inside the favelas, and pointed
                                 to this facet of the campaign as an unprecedented success [<a href="#R91">91</a>]. This reduction in homicides bolstered the overwhelming support already bestowed
                                 on the program by the city’s ruling elite, middle classes, and mainstream press.

                              <p id="d1e665">Surveys conducted in select pacified favelas through 2012 also suggested that residents
                                 perceived a general improvement in security, but that they also feared the government
                                 would abandon the favelas after the Olympics and that traffickers would return. In
                                 addition, the surveys identified a lack of community facilities and services in the
                                 areas of health, education, and leisure, as well as problems associated with the relationship
                                 between community members and police, and in levels of crime other than homicide [<a href="#R28">28</a>].

                              <p id="d1e670">Gradually, the praise the UPP had received during its first few years began to wane.
                                 The mediascape started to expose cracks in the UPP as the 2014 World Cup drew close,
                                 and new assessments of data began pointing to rising crime (up by 116% in Niteroi
                                 in 2013) [<a href="#R92">92</a>]; increases in conflict [<a href="#R93">93</a>]; and a slew of human rights violations [<a href="#R94">94</a>]. Scholars began cautioning against any euphoric adoration of the UPP policy [<a href="#R95">95</a>]. Esther Werling’s HASOW report [<a href="#R28">28</a>] determined that the UPP did not represent a paradigm shift in public security policy
                                 at all, but was merely a continuation of vertically structured intervention and historical
                                 segregation. Robson Rodrigues concluded that the policy was embedded with structural
                                 inequalities and instituted without dialogue or effective participation [<a href="#R96">96</a>], and the citizen-led movement, Rio Com Vamos, declared a lack of institutional reform
                                 both in the police and the criminal justice system. This, Rio Com Vamos charges, contributes
                                 to a culture of violence and corruption that dominates Rio’s political landscape and
                                 affects how it plays out in the favelas [<a href="#R97">97</a>].

                                 das Favelas, studied favelas in close proximity to those presented in this paper.
                                 His report concluded that if the State’s perpetual culture of legitimized violence
                                 could be overcome and trust between police and residents restored, the UPP may open
                                 up a social space where the citizenship rights of the informal sector could be affirmed.
                                 He suggested that if this perception could be turned into organized opinion, a fracture
                                 may occur in the current institutional model (based on the violent social control
                                 of the urban poor), and transition to a model which operates under the language of
                                 rights [<a href="#R20">20</a>].

                              <p id="d1e699">However, with the UPP losing funding with the phasing out of Pronasci (the federal
                                 program which supplied its multi-year seed funds), and the collapse of the campaign’s
                                 largest corporate contributor, the EBX Group in 2012 (now bankrupt and under federal
                                 investigation), it is doubtful the UPP can continue to occupy the favelas after the
                                 Olympics in the way as it does now (if at all). Though the city remains silent on
                                 the issue, it is evident that the UPP is already having trouble holding onto much
                                 of the ground it has gained.

                              <p id="d1e705">Three case studies implemented in and bound by three different favelas were selected
                                 for this report. Each explores police occupation, social interventions, and economic
                                 development activities and their effects on favela residents and the territories in
                                 close proximity to them.

                              <p id="d1e707">The case studies have been chosen because of the variance they offer: each has been
                                 pacified for a different length of time; each has a different socio-economic level;
                                 each is varied in population size; each deals with different levels of violence; and
                                 each is situated in a different geographical area. All were controlled by drug trafficking
                                 gangs prior to pacification.

                              <p id="d1e719">Because this study focuses on only three of the 38 favela communities under UPP control,
                                 it is limited in its scope and ability to generalize. In addition, though it tries
                                 to take into account a large number of shifting dimensions, the conditions inside
                                 favelas are subject to an ever-evolving set of precarious and fragile social variables.
                                 This renders it impossible to measure the overall impact of pacification in definitive
                                 terms. Its aim is, therefore, to more intimately convey how the UPP operates, how
                                 it enables urbanization activities, and how residents are being affected within these
                                 three pacification scenarios.

                              <p id="d1e721">Due to incongruities and unreliability of available data due to official underreporting,
                                 and the inability to acquire accurate quantitative information inside favelas, this
                                 case-study impact report used a mixed methodology approach based on multi-year qualitative
                                 field research that was cross-analyzed against a range of empirical data. The qualitative
                                 research was conducted while the author was working in land use restoration projects
                                 in favelas with favela residents from 2010 through 2015 [<a href="#R98">98</a>]. The information is derived from direct observations, conversations with favela
                                 residents, meetings with citizens’ committees and Residents’ Associations, interactions
                                 with drug traffickers, UPP officers, PAC workers, and municipal stakeholders, including
                                 the Department for the Environment.

                              <p id="d1e734">The cluster of favelas that include Babilônia and Chapéu Mangueira are nestled into
                                 the mountainsides of the wealthy neighborhood of Leme, located at the end of Copacabana
                                 beach, the most popular tourist destination in Rio. This privileged location provides
                                 favela residents easy access to the largest service and construction industries’ job
                                 market in the city. Many of the women from these favelas work as maids and nannies
                                 for the wealthy residents of Rio’s affluent South Zone, while the men provide the
                                 labor as the construction workers and bricklayers who build the high-rises that dominate
                                 the dramatic beachfront skyline.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e736">Over the decades, the residents of Babilônia and Chapéu have not established prominent
                                 labor or union associations. Instead, their political agency has tended to be rooted
                                 in the favelas themselves. These favelas have always been the proving grounds for
                                 State interventions, including the UPP, because of their small scale, their relatively
                                 low levels of conflict, and their spatial and social proximity to those who draft
                                 the public policies implemented in them.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e738">Babilônia has the best socio-economic indicators among the three case studies analyzed
                                 in this report, with a high Social Development Index [<a href="#R01">1</a>] and well developed infrastructure when compared to other favelas in Rio. There is
                                 almost complete access to water, sewage and garbage collection in these two communities,
                                 and approximately 75% of residents are homeowners. Despite such high social development
                                 indicators, illiteracy remains a problem, particularly in Babilônia, where 15.9% of
                                 the population older than fifteen is illiterate [<a href="#R100">100</a>].

                              <p id="d1e746">This area has had one of the most harmonious relationships between a trafficking-dominated
                                 favela and its surrounding neighborhood. Up until the mid-2000s, drug-related conflicts
                                 were rare, <i>baile funks</i> (dance parties) were attended by middle class youth, and there had been little adverse
                                 effect on the formal real estate market in Leme. By 2005 however, the favelas had
                                 suffered a series of attempted takeovers by enemy drug factions, and relations between
                                 the formal and informal communities began to strain under the stress of frequent gunfire.

                              <p id="d1e751">In May 2009, Special Ops Military Police moved in to occupy the two hills of Chapéu
                                 and Babilônia, making arrests and seizing drugs and arms. By June, the UPP had established
                                 their headquarters in the upper reaches of Babilônia, and 107 UPP officers were installed
                                 to oversee 3,740 residents [<a href="#R14">14</a>]—a ratio of one police officer per 37 people. Though Rio’s Mayor Eduardo Paes and
                                 State Governor Sérgio Cabral both came to Babilônia to formally inaugurate the historic
                                 event [<a href="#R101">101</a>], residents were not informed of the community ceremony. This demonstrates, in a
                                 most basic way, how favela residents are left out of even the smallest of public gestures.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e759">The relative success of Babilônia’s pacification is often emphasized as part the sustainable
                                 legacy of the city’s mega-events. Many sustainability initiatives were implemented
                                 in Babilônia in preparation for the United Nations Rio+20 Sustainable Development
                                 Summit. Under Rio’s Morar Carioca Verde program, designs were drawn up for new housing,
                                 a commercial center, and a cultural center, along with weatherizing interventions
                                 in private homes, plans for household waste management and recycling systems, and
                                 water and energy efficiency improvements (LED lamps, solar water heaters, rainwater
                                 collection systems). Reforestation of the surrounding area was also planned so that
                                 tourists could access trails with locals serving as guides.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e761">By the end of 2013, sixteen ‘green’ houses had been built, an LED pathway installed,
                                 and almost 200,000 seedlings planted [<a href="#R102">102</a>]. 60 homes were also demolished [<a href="#R103">103</a>]—without consulting residents. The cost of the project in total was R$ 43 million
                                 (US$ 23.5 million) [<a href="#R104">104</a>].

                              <p id="d1e772">Another initiative, the corporate-funded Sustainable City project, also launched around
                                 the same time to coincide with the UN Rio+20 mega-event. The project included a housing
                                 improvement program that trained 110 participants as masons, electricians, plumbers,
                                 and locksmiths; fifteen volunteers were given classes in domestic-scale agroecology;
                                 and residents were offered a community tourism program that resulted in dozens of
                                 tourism operators being ‘regularized’—sanctioned by the government.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e774">One of the great social promises of the UPP was that it would bring jobs opportunities
                                 for residents, however very limited forms of micro-tourism may be one of the only
                                 ways in which this promise has actually been delivered. There are a few local tourist
                                 guides in the more accessible South Zone favelas, and in Babilônia and Chapéu Mangueira,
                                 the community has a registered tour guide cooperative designed to take tourists on
                                 the nature trail up through the forested hillside. Some residents complain tourists
                                 do not bring much money into the community while others see it as a small opportunity.
                                 A few small-scale private initiatives also offer cheap accommodations to foreign backpackers
                                 wanting to stay in favelas, though most are run by foreigners, and only one by local
                                 residents. The favela is brazenly advertised in the UPP Social’s promotional video,
                                 which depicts a group of gringo tourists happily being served by a local proprietor
                                 as the only patrons in the restaurant [<a href="#R105">105</a>]. Babilônia may have become the UPP’s poster child for local business success delivered
                                 through pacification, but residents and critics alike claim it is little more than
                                 urban propaganda [<a href="#R106">106</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e782">Babilônia provides the city’s most sanitized location for dignitaries to be taken
                                 to see a tranquil image of Rio’s pacified favelas. Former New York City Mayor Michael
                                 Bloomberg was ushered through the favela during the UN Rio+20 Summit to see the success
                                 of pacification and of the Morar Carioca Verde program. In the forty minutes he was
                                 there, he did not interact with a single resident.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e785">According to the IPP, about 4,000 residents overall have benefited from infrastructure
                                 and urbanization programs in the Babilônia and Chapéu under the UPP. However, many
                                 challenges still persist. Education remains a problem. Municipal school enrolment
                                 numbers decreased by 15.2% between 2007 and 2010 [<a href="#R107">107</a>]. Housing also presents barriers to stability. Some residents have waited years for
                                 regularization approvals, while others have been forcibly evicted, received low financial
                                 compensation for relocation, or been forced to move to the periphery (a three hour
                                 commute back to the city) [<a href="#R108">108</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e793">Next to the favelas, in the <i>asfalto</i> neighborhood of Leme, residents whose apartments faced Babilônia/Chapéu Mangueira
                                 suffered from the negative effect the communities had on their property values prior
                                 to the UPP occupation. Many also felt at risk of being injured or killed by stray

                                 conflicted about the pacification, not only because of gentrification, but because
                                 of the way in which citizen involvement in decision-making processes is neglected,
                                 and because the implementation of most social programs is isolated to coincide with
                                 major international events [<a href="#R79">79</a>]. Other complaints charge that access to community facilities, such as sports complexes
                                 (previously open for use 24/7) are now micro-managed by the UPP and require a lengthy
                                 bureaucratic approval process and advanced scheduling before entry to them can be
                                 gained. Community entertainment is either subject to restrictions such as curfew,
                                 or is banned altogether, as is the case with <i>baile funks</i>, which have been made illegal under UPP policy.

                              <p id="d1e831">The Tijuca favelas are a cluster of small favela communities located in the North
                                 Zone of Rio de Janeiro. They occupy the social middle ground somewhere between the
                                 economic privilege of Babilônia and the impoverishment of Manguinhos.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e833">Complexo do Borel comprises of three communities—Borel and Casa Branca, situated on
                                 the hillside slopes, and Chácara do Céu, at the top of the hill. Formiga is another
                                 part of the favela cluster, located on a nearby hillside along a winding road. It
                                 is one of the oldest and steepest communities in the area, and has a high level of
                                 built density. Formiga originated as a formal subdivision that was later declared
                                 illegal. Borel also originated as a formal occupation, with residents being relocated
                                 to the hills from the city center in early favela removals. Other relocations followed
                                 in the 1950s.

                              <p id="d1e835">Associational life developed historically in this area as part of the struggle against
                                 the city’s removal policies. It later evolved to advocate for education, health and
                                 leisure facilities. The development and sense of political agency of these favelas
                                 has been deeply entwined with labor movements and unions. This was where the city’s
                                 first community association, the Union of Favela Workers, was formed in 1954. It has
                                 since served as an important example for other neighborhood associations.

                              <p id="d1e837">Over the years, adding to the conflict that has to do with forced removal and relocation,
                                 residents have had to contend with intense violence erupting between rival gangs for
                                 the control of favela territory. Over a period of twenty years, the predictability
                                 of the conflict between these favelas had become so commonplace that it developed
                                 certain regularities, including the scheduling of armed engagements, which came to
                                 be known as “shootouts at an agreed upon time” [<a href="#R01">1</a>].

                              <p id="d1e842">The ongoing conflict translated into a series of limitations on residents’ mobility
                                 across the city. Territorial disputes over the <i>bocas</i> (drug selling points) broke apart the communities that had once been perceived as
                                 extensions of one another. These favelas had shared a long history of unified political
                                 mobilization and social life spanning from family relations to religious ties, from
                                 participation in one of the oldest and most traditional samba schools in the region
                                 (Unidos da Tijuca), to the attendance of <i>baile funks</i>, the dance parties now banned under the UPP.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e850">The banning of <i>baile funks</i> is complex issue. Funk Carioca (funk music from Rio de Janeiro) originated in the
                                 favelas in the 1980s, and by the 1990s <i>baile funks</i> had become popular community events. The UPP takes the position that <i>baile funks</i> promote drug culture and gang affiliation among youth. Because the <i>baile funks</i> are often hosted by the ruling gang, the use of drugs and the presence of traffickers
                                 have been prominent at such events. Social analysts claim, however, that banning the
                                 parties, which extends to the banning of funk music in general, shuts down an authentic
                                 cultural expression of favela youth [<a href="#R115">115</a>]. Both sides of the argument can be legitimatized.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e867">In the case of the Tijuca favelas, the rift between rival <i>baile funk</i> scenes (associated with the rivalry between gangs), greatly altered the social panorama
                                 of the entire area. By the end of 2009, attending a Friday night <i>baile funk</i> came with the added risk of gun violence because both the ADA and the CV gangs were
                                 involved in an intense territorial war for control of the different hillsides [<a href="#R116">116</a>].

                              <p id="d1e878">Because of the gang wars, the close ties that had traditionally linked these favela
                                 communities were progressively cut off from one another. Factions marked favela residents
                                 with gang identities, and prohibited their mobility through rival territories. Residents
                                 were compelled to change their commuting routes in order to avoid entering ‘enemy’
                                 territory. These turf disputes spilled over into the formal city to impact nearby
                                 public schools. By the mid-1990s, drug trafficking violence had led to a radical depreciation
                                 in property value for buildings that faced the favelas, with real estate prices plummeting
                                 to the point that they were virtually equal to that of the favelas [<a href="#R117">117</a>].

                              <p id="d1e883">By the time the UPP advanced in these neighborhoods, residents had already anticipated
                                 their pacification with high expectations. Borel’s UPP occupation was the eighth established
                                 in the city, and the first in Rio’s North Zone. In June 2010, the UPP entered Borel.
                                 By July, Formiga was also occupied. UPP units, with 500 military police officers in
                                 total, now occupy seven Tijuca favela communities, controlling an area that is home
                                 to approximately 60,000 inhabitants.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e885">The UPP directly oversees about 12,815 residents from the favelas, with troops operating
                                 at a ratio of one officer to every 33 inhabitants [<a href="#R02">2</a>]. Due to the built density of the area, the steep geography, and the social complexity
                                 of relations between residents, traffickers and police, the difficulties the UPP face
                                 to remain in control of territory are substantial. Moreover, the Social Development
                                 Index for this area remains disturbingly low (0.468) [<a href="#R118">118</a>].

                                 complain that there is no real government interest in creating employment and that

                                 [<a href="#R121">121</a>]. Emop also claims that the planning process was participatory, though this semblance
                                 of involvement was, at best, ostensibly superficial (for example, children were invited

                                 the mandatory curfew imposed by the UPP. The youth demanded entitlement to come and
                                 go freely from the favela, claiming that now, more than ever before, they were unable
                                 to move through their community. A coordinator of a religious organization in Borel
                                 also claims that many adolescents—those aged between 11 and 18 who previously worked
                                 in the <i>bocas</i>—are now aimlessly roaming the favelas as outcasts constantly harrassed by police
                                 [<a href="#R130">130</a>]. UPP-imposed arbitrary curfews, police brutality, and the illegal taxes extorted
                                 by UPP officers [<a href="#R131">131</a>] continue to spark human rights protests and paint a portrait of state oppression
                                 that has become familiar to Borel residents over the years.

                              <p id="d1e955">In Formiga, things are different in regards to public security. Formiga is a small
                                 favela, with 4,312 residents governed by 111 UPP officers [<a href="#R02">2</a>]. Because of its size, Formiga has possibly been easier to pacify. This has been
                                 one of the most successful implementations of the UPP in Tijuca. The UPP in Formiga
                                 has resulted in less conflict than the other pacifications in the area, and security
                                 concerns are lower in comparison with the other favelas [<a href="#R132">132</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e963">On the whole, the UPP has improved the Tijuca communities by stopping, if only temporarily,
                                 the regularity of violent conflicts between the police and armed groups, and between
                                 rival gang factions. This has produced an immediate relief in the daily lives of many
                                 residents, many of whom have been caught in the crossfire, literally, for decades.
                                 However, as the violent character of policing in general continues, citizens of these
                                 areas still need to be vigilant in regards to their security situation. As well, they
                                 must overcome the obstacles put up by the government and police that prevent them
                                 from receiving adequate attention in regard to their complaints concerning the lack
                                 of adequate infrastructure improvements, social freedoms, employment opportunities,
                                 and civic participation in decision-making. This scenario mirrors the overall criticisms
                                 leveled against the UPP by human rights critics of the program [<a href="#R74">74</a>].

                              <p id="d1e971">Manguinhos is located around an old industrial suburb in the North Zone of Rio. It
                                 has been intricately connected to the favela removal efforts since the 1940s—as an
                                 area to which people were relocated to after they were removed from other favelas
                                 around the city.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e973">The Manguinhos Complex is a cluster of fifteen favelas and housing projects inhabited
                                 by a population of 35,000 people [<a href="#R02">2</a>]. This large complex is located in close proximity to many other densely populated
                                 favelas that weave a fabric of irregular housing across the sprawling North Zone of
                                 the city. The flat landscape of Manguinhos extends as far as the eye can see, enmeshed
                                 with the ruins of derelict and abandoned factories turned into ‘occupations’ and incorporated
                                 into the favela landscape along with the government relocation housing projects built
                                 in the 1970s.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e978">Manguinhos is today hemmed in by a series of open sewers that once flourished as healthy
                                 rivers, and a labyrinth of highways and super-highways overflowing with traffic. The
                                 favela is located under live, high voltage transmission lines next to an elevated
                                 train track. The area is plagued by floods, urban waste and toxic pollutants. Numerous
                                 environmental risks afflict the residents of Manguinhos, and in particular its youth,
                                 who are 500 times more likely to develop cancer and neurological disorders because
                                 of exposure to high levels of lead that pollute the area [<a href="#R133">133</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e983">The demographics and poverty indicators of Manguinhos are dismal. The Human Development
                                 Index is 0.65%—among the five lowest in Rio. 15% of girls between the ages of fifteen
                                 and seventeen have children. The monthly per capita income for 2012 was R$ 188 (US$
                                 60), and unemployment rates languish at between 30–50% [<a href="#R134">134</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e988">The demise of industry in Manguinhos from the mid-1980s on resulted in an intensification
                                 of the drug trade. The favela’s location at the core of a vast region dominated by
                                 the CV gang secured Manguinhos as a trafficking stronghold that held both the police
                                 and rival factions at bay. Thus the boldness of the drug trade’s appropriation of
                                 the public spaces of the favela reached new heights.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e990">Referred to as Rio’s ‘Gaza Strip’, Manguinhos was the site of the city’s largest <i>crackolândia</i> (crackland) and one of its most violent drug trafficking centers. The situation was,
                                 for all practical purposes, a full-blown internal armed conflict and the ultimate
                                 representation of Rio’s urban warfare issues. The organized drug trade, open conflict
                                 with rival factions and/or conflict with State military forces, laid bare the humanitarian
                                 impact on civilians trapped by daily violence. From public executions to police shootouts
                                 with Special Forces units, Manguinhos was the pinnacle example of gang rule [<a href="#R135">135</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e998">The drug trade had taken root to the extent that the <i>bocas</i> had become a long string of shanties, littered with broken couches and old mattresses,
                                 where crack addicts of all ages prostituted themselves, and where makeshift lean-tos
                                 provided shelter for the crack dealers who worked, literally, behind the counters
                                 of stalls originally used by vendors in the farmers’ market. Drug culture spilled
                                 over to the bars and brothels and into the streets, to permeate almost every aspect
                                 of community life.
                                 
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e1003">The heightened visibility of the drug trade in Manguinhos can be attributed to the
                                 uncontested hegemony of the Comando Vermelho, the oldest drug faction in the city,
                                 where the gang leadership was least vulnerable to enemy invasions. The CV’s operations,
                                 including the stockpiling of weapons and the regional distribution of drugs to the
                                 favelas city-wide, were centered in the nearby Complexo do Alemão favela until late
                                 in 2010 when the UPP took control there. Manguinhos subsequently absorbed the bulk
                                 of CV operations, including its headquarters. This increased the already large-scale
                                 visibility of the drug economy and elevated the flow of drug migrants into the favela.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e1005">The social landscape of Manguinhos visibly changed in October 2012, when BOPE units
                                 stormed in with 1,300 troops assisted by helicopters and tanks, to smash through whatever
                                 obstacles were in their way and symbolically liberate the favela from the stronghold
                                 of the CVs. The UPP consequently installed 588 officers in Manguinhos, one for every
                                 60 residents [<a href="#R02">2</a>]. The shacks of the <i>crackolândia</i> were demolished and addicts were deposited in shelters for a few days before finding
                                 their way back to the streets [<a href="#R134">134</a>]. Though the physical armed presence of the CVs no longer dominate the landscape,
                                 they still remain highly active in the area (<a href="#FIG4">Figure 4</a>).
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e1019">Even before the favela’s takeover by the UPP, a large-scale urbanization project was
                                 well underway to redevelop the area that surrounds Manguinhos leading up to the Maracanã
                                 Sports Stadium. Funded by PAC, the urbanization project began in 2008 and is coordinated
                                 by the State Ministry of Works (Seobras), in partnership with Emop. According to the
                                 State Department of Finance, the total PAC investment between 2008 and 2010 was around
                                 R$ 3.1 billion (US$ 1.6 billion). Among the works delivered in 2009 was a 35,500 square
                                 meter Civic Center located on the grounds of a new mid-rise housing complex built
                                 on the grounds of the old Army Supply Depot (DSUP). The Center included a library
                                 (with a theater and cinema), a recycling facility, an ‘income generation center’,
                                 a health clinic, a women’s social service center, a legal aid center, a sports court,
                                 and a high school attached to a swimming pool known as the ‘Manguinhos Water Park’
                                 [<a href="#R136">136</a>].

                                 to the neighborhood [<a href="#R137">137</a>], but many services, including the library, the swimming pool, and the youth center,
                                 have already been shut down, or operate in a reduced capacity, due to lack of funding.

                              <p id="d1e1037">The swimming pool, in particular, is a prime example of the gulf between political
                                 rhetoric and service delivery. The project was initiated after a thirteen year-old
                                 Manguinhos teenager photographed swimming in a mud puddle went viral. In response
                                 to the public embarrassment, former President Lula announced a community pool for
                                 the people of Manguinhos. The Water Park was subsequently built along with the high
                                 school and inaugurated in 2009 with the President in attendance at the opening ceremony.

                                 according to the State Department of Education, people were “smashing the place”.

                                 to experience respite from the heat (which reaches up to 47° C), children continue
                                 to swim in the rivers that the untreated sewerage runs into [<a href="#R139">139</a>].

                                 outlined in these three case reports, and has seen the most interventions of the three
                                 districts examined. Residents have been allowed little voice in the redevelopment
                                 of their neighborhood, and tensions between police and residents remain critically
                                 strained. However, there have been some improvements brought to the area through pacification,
                                 most notably in ending the high visibility of the armed drug trafficking trade on
                                 the street and the effect this has on young children. There has also been a decrease
                                 in the likelihood of death or injury by stray bullets, even though youth, in particular,
                                 remain at risk of violence through police actions.

                                 those who work in the garden, or those whose homes overlook the kilometer-long space.
                                 Children can now exit their homes without fear, and are able to see clean, productive
                                 space, rather than a dangerous and vermin-infested <i>crackolândia</i> built on top of a garbage heap. Children often comment on how much better their neighborhood

                                 have some merit, particularly in smaller favelas where conflict is low and policing
                                 is delivered in conjunction with social services, provided they can be continued.

                                    <p id="d1e1285">One of the most positive aspects brought to favelas by the UPP is the interruption
                                       to drug trafficking brought about by a reduction in the visibility of <i>bocas</i> and a decrease in ‘open carry’ drug trafficking culture, though there still remains
                                       substantial pressure on teenage boys to enter into gang culture (<a href="#FIG8">Figure 8</a>). De-normalizing the propensity for the open carry of firearms by civilians is important
                                       in making Rio a safer place to live, and the UPPs have helped begin this process by
                                       giving a generation of youth the opportunity to grow up in environments in which gang
                                       violence is not the dominant feature of social control.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e1293">The most obvious positive change brought by the UPPs was the reduction in lethal violence
                                       inside pacified favelas between 2008 and 2011. During this time, the presence of the
                                       UPP is estimated to have saved 60 lives per year per 100,000 inhabitants, and overall
                                       lethal violence, including extra-judicial police killings (known as resistance killings)
                                       were also reduced [<a href="#R91">91</a>].
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e1298">However, the numbers of resistance killings at the hands of police since 2012 have
                                       again been on the rise. Youth homicide rates in Rio de Janeiro reached 56.5 homicides
                                       per 100,000 in 2012 [<a href="#R178">178</a>]. Though this was not only attributable to the UPPs, they were a dominant contributor
                                       to this growing trend. More recent figures show resistance killings by police between
                                       January and August 2015 (459 cases) [<a href="#R179">179</a>] exceed the numbers for all of 2013 (416), and are equal to 80% of total cases reported
                                       for the year 2014 (563 cases) [<a href="#R180">180</a>].

                                    <p id="d1e1309">Residents cite a general decrease in armed conflict between rival gangs and between
                                       gangs and police. However, the incidences and threats of armed violence perpetrated
                                       by the UPP produce ongoing psychological stress within the community, particularly
                                       in youth [<a href="#R181">181</a>]. Residents continue to be restricted in their mobility and are searched, detained,
                                       and arrested at will by police both inside the favelas and at UPP checkpoints that
                                       control the entry and exit points to them [<a href="#R182">182</a>].

                                    <p id="d1e1317">Though open warfare has decreased overall, armed conflicts between police and gang
                                       members, and between rival gang members now vying for domination of the same internal
                                       territory has created an unpredictability to gunfire exchanges that continue to result
                                       in civilian deaths. The arbitrariness of violence in combination with police corruption
                                       has exasperated the problems associated with the disruption of drug trafficking. As
                                       well, the dismantling of the drug trafficking economy itself has been deliberately
                                       avoided as a goal of the UPP campaign, therefore the culture of drug trafficking remains
                                       endemic and unabated. In addition, drug trafficking and possession of marajuana, crack,
                                       and cocaine within the armed forces rose 337% between the years 2002 and 2014 [<a href="#R183">183</a>]. Complaints about abuse and corrupt practices in the UPP police are increasing [<a href="#R101">101</a>]. In 2012, more than 300 military police were expelled from the institution for corruption
                                       or involvement with militias, including murder and extortion crimes [<a href="#R184">184</a>].

                                       in its ‘war against crime’ [<a href="#R185">185</a>], are largely motivated by populist electoral politics. Time and time again, these
                                       policies have been discontinued due to regime changes and budget cuts [<a href="#R186">186</a>], leaving residents to cope, again, with living under gang rule [<a href="#R20">20</a>]. This, coupled with the rising tide of police killings [<a href="#R187">187</a>], continues to reinforce negative perceptions of Rio’s police interventions. Police
                                       commit more than one in every six of Rio de Janeiro’s homicides. Four out of five
                                       of them are perpetrated on young, poor Afro-Brazilians. Deaths caused by the police
                                       of Rio de Janeiro grew 18% in 2015, with police killing 517 people just between the
                                       months of January and September [<a href="#R188">188</a>]. Police often alter evidence to conceal the facts, another reason that leaves the
                                       general public, and favela residents in particular, mistrustful of them [<a href="#R189">189</a>].

                                       of their communities. Public demonstrations, as well as community attempts to legally
                                       organize or unionize are swiftly and harshly quashed by the city.

                                       that has been delivered—the schools, daycares, health clinics, libraries and gardens
                                       are highly valued by residents, but are continually at risk of being shut down.

                                       was allocated by the state for project management and staffing. The library was first
                                       forced to reduce its operating hours in April 2015, and by November, employees were

                                       in the favelas. In 2010 alone, the company invested R$ 38 million to rewire communities

                                       urbanization activities that are propelling gentrification [<a href="#R30">30</a>]. Rents have now overtaken sales in favelas, and rents for homes and lajes (concrete

                                       than rents for the city as a whole. Sales of regularized real estate in favelas now

                                       ways to earn a living, many will not turn away from the illicit sources of income
                                       obtainable through selling drugs. Income generation would also help absorb the rising
                                       cost of living brought about by pacification. Increased and better vocational training

                                       would require i) employment creation to allow residents to afford rising living costs
                                       and to replace former illicit sources of income; ii) a reduction in violence on the

                                       favelas, if only in a limited way, is necessary, at least in theory. It is a step
                                       that should have been taken long ago. But the current process is defective because
                                       instead of being a security strategy for the entire city, the UPP is driven to fulfill
                                       the needs of mega-events, construction conglomerates, real estate interests, and those
                                       who see favelas as potential markets. Urbanization decisions are made without participation,

                                       As long as the state continues its interventions through an exclusionary culture that

                                 However, the pacification of select favelas, rather than being viewed as a public
                                 security policy, must be understood as a policy designed specifically for the purposes

                                 into a mega-events host city strengthens an already aggressive urbanization agenda.
                                 All this capital accumulation involves a degree of dispossession—at the very least
                                 the dispossession of public assets and political process. Favela communities, although
                                 they may be somewhat liberated from the influence of drug gangs, are also dispossessed
                                 of their self-determination in relation to community affairs under the UPP. On a very
                                 physical level, thousands are being evicted from their homes or forced out through
                                 gentrification.

                                 previously abandoned by the State, and now considered enormously valuable as the object
                                 of real estate speculation, are appropriated by force in disregard of the right to

                                 to enhance the right to the city for all, will require reassigning key roles in decision-making
                                 apparatuses to recognize the importance of inclusive citizenship and the benefits
                                 of social equality. Introducing mechanisms whereby citizens begin to have a voice
                                 in how their communities are shaped and managed is critical to creating wider public
                                 security and sustainable socio-economic development.

                              <p id="d1e1473">Favela residents are critically positioned to advise the city on their needs. As a
                                 consequence and necessity of informality, favelas are shaped by ingenuity. Residents’
                                 capacity to adapt to new and challenging contexts distinguishes them as exceptionally
                                 able to organically plan, design, and evolve within complex and heterogeneous mixed-use
                                 contexts. The qualities displayed in the resilience and flexibility of these communities’
                                 abilities to create alternative systems for real estate title exchange, loans and
                                 financing, public service infrastructure delivery, urban planning, and housing construction,
                                 realized with few material resources, offer an ingenious platform from which to develop
                                 vibrant, community-centered approaches to both policing and urbanization. Even though
                                 many internal associational structures have been compromised under gang control, there
                                 are still opportunities for building inclusive municipal models in which favelas,
                                 and their residents, can better integrate into the broader fabric of the city through
                                 collaborative city-building processes that mobilize informal sector residents without
                                 disenfranchising them. In other words, pacification is a political choice, and the
                                 way pacification is implemented also consists of sets of political choices that perceives
                                 of, and deals with informality in a particular way.

                              <p id="d1e1475">There are four dominant, and somewhat overlapping perspectives on informality. The
                                 Dualist school of thought subscribes to the notion that informal activities have few
                                 connections to the formal economy, and that the sector operates as a separate, less-advantaged,
                                 or dual segment of the economy. Dualists believe governments need create more jobs,
                                 credit, business development services, basic infrastructure and social services for
                                 the sector. Structuralists see the informal and formal economies as intrinsically
                                 linked, with informal wage earners subordinated by the interests of capitalist development.
                                 They argue that governments should address the unequal relationship between big business
                                 and subordinated producers and workers by regulating both commercial and employment
                                 relationships. Legalists believe in a formal regulatory environment but acknowledge
                                 that formal commercial interests collude with government to bureaucratize or legislate
                                 to their advantage, and argue that governments need to simplify bureaucratic procedures
                                 in order to incentivize informal enterprises to regularize their businesses, property
                                 and assets. Voluntarists charge that informal enterprises have an unfair advantage
                                 because of their avoidance of formal regulations, taxes, and other costs of production
                                 and services. They argue that informal enterprises should be brought into the formal
                                 regulatory framework in order to increase the tax base and profit margins of the public
                                 and private sectors. The informal sector can also be seen as illegal, because it is
                                 involved in producing activities that are forbidden, unauthorized, or operate in non-compliance
                                 with regularization laws [<a href="#R209">209</a>]. Whatever the perspective, at the core of all these theories lies an opposition
                                 between the informal and formal.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e1481">Within this oppositional dichotomy lies the assumption that the informal sector is
                                 unorganized. On this assumption, it is often discredited for its deficiencies, whereas
                                 the formal sector is associated with structure, and therefore, organizational success.
                                 This is an important aspect of the formal versus informal debate, especially in regard
                                 to policy decisions that lead to formal interventions—often with disastrous results.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e1483">In recent years, theorizing about the formal-informality dichotomy has begun to move
                                 beyond this conceptualization to discuss the specific objectives of policy intervention
                                 outside of this narrow development discourse. There is much evidence to suggest that
                                 informally organized communities can be highly functioning and more effective than
                                 inefficient or corrupt government structures, and in the case of Rio, the government’s
                                 revolving-door intervention policies [<a href="#R210">210</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e1488">Each circumstance, however, is different. Each region, or even favela, presents diverse
                                 and variable conditions that make generalizing about informality difficult. Each favela
                                 of different size, topography, geography, whether under gang control or free of it,
                                 presents a very unique set of complex circumstances. Therefore, Rio’s informal sector
                                 defined in terms of a lack of social and legal protections may not be the only, or
                                 even the foremost aspect to examine with respect to fostering inclusive stability.
                                 For example, some people may choose to enter or remain in the high end of informal
                                 employment voluntarily because it pays more than formal employment, whereas those
                                 that work informally because of limited opportunities have very different degrees
                                 of choice within the informal economy. On the other hand, informal employment (and
                                 informality in general) that is the outcome of structural constraints that limit choice,
                                 is a clear barrier to inclusivity [<a href="#R211">211</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e1493">Social protection policies that are designed to reduce risks among Rio’s vulnerable
                                 sector should also focus on designing appropriate forms of social protection based
                                 on actual sources of risk and need. Evaluating how issues concerning favelas should
                                 be integrated into State development policy requires determining to what extent access
                                 to social and legal protections represents freedoms or constraints in the ability
                                 of individuals to participate in, or benefit from, municipal intervention activities.
                                 Informality or regularization may exasperate other social or economic constraints,
                                 rather than representing distinct, separate constraints in themselves. For example,
                                 a lack of access to micro-finance represents a constraint for many small-scale enterprises,
                                 yet the UPP curtails access even further through excluding the informal sector from
                                 being eligible to receive this financial service. In Brazil, micro-credit’s largest
                                 failure is that it is unable to reach those that need it most because of lending policies
                                 [<a href="#R212">212</a>]. The solution involves providing informal enterprises with access to credit, rather
                                 than excluding them from it because they are informal, per se.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e1498">Part of the solution to integrating favelas into the formal city of Rio may involve
                                 creating new institutions, relationships, practices, and access to opportunities that,
                                 through their existence, make informality more stable, rather than focusing on the
                                 goal of eradicating informality in general. In addition, inclusivity requires not
                                 only expanding the number of choices available to individuals, but also the quality
                                 of those choices [<a href="#R211">211</a>].

                                 lowest-income constituencies requires consistently representing their identities,
                                 interests and concerns. In recent years, the rise of third sector social movements
                                 advocating justice, inclusion and peace as priorities for the urban poor have intensified
                                 reform pressure against corruption and brought attention to flawed government priorities
                                 and demands for sustainable services and policies. Dedicated activism and a strong
                                 independent mediascape continue to struggle within a geography of fragmented resistance
                                 to protest neoliberal policy in relation to the mega-events—at great personal risk

                                 National Movement for Housing Vindication, the Landless Workers’ Movement, Global
                                 Justice, the Institute for the Defense of Human Rights, and the National Movement
                                 for the Fight for Housing, to name a few, seek a holistic solution to urban reform
                                 and an end to the housing crisis through coordinating the informal sector and promoting
                                 their right to the city. Many local civil sector organizations also engage in justice
                                 issues that aim to redress human rights and territorial issues concerning the architecture
                                 of power and economic transition in relation to the changes being brought about in
                                 connection to Rio’s mega-events.

                              <p id="d1e1505">Overall, however, this is only achievable through institutional reform, and institutional

                                 it is highly improbable that Rio de Janeiro will gather the political will to progress
                                 beyond what it already is—a city of exception designed to benefit the bourgeoisie.

                                          first inaugurated. Launched in a state program known as the ‘UPP Social’, they were
                                          promoted as part of an overall strategy to im- prove services and foster democratic
                                          inclusion of the favelas. Rio’s former state Governor S´ ergio Cabral claimed the
                                          program would be the positive state pres- ence that would rebuild social capital in
                                          the favelas. Within months, however, the state had transferred the UPP’s social responsibility
                                          to the municipality where it continued to stall. Eventually, in 2014, the UPP Social
                                          was rebranded as the Rio+Social and is now administered under the IPP, which has developed
                                          a partnership with UN-HABITAT to advise on the pro- gram.

                                       <td> One mother showed me the place where a stray bullet had come through a window of
                                          her Leme apartment and lodged itself in the headboard of her four year-old daughter’s
                                          bed. Favela homes are even more vulner- able to stray bullets. Bullet holes are visible
                                          in many of the brick exteriors of homes that have been in the way of armed exchanges.
                                          The brick is easily pen- etrated by the high-powered firearms used by both police
                                          and traffickers, leaving residents little protec- tion, even inside their homes. If
                                          caught in crossfire it is, more than likely, extremely difficult to get out due to
                                          the complex geography and built density of favelas, and the intensity of armed gunfire
                                          exchange. If shot, it is almost impossible to access medical attention until the conflict
                                          is over—which can last hours or even days;.
