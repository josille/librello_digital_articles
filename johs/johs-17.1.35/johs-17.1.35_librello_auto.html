                                 so that students can honestly express their individuality and opinions without fear
                                 of being the target of violence harassment, or hate speech. In this paper, we examine
                                 the relationship between the school environment, individual characteristics and family
                                 in shaping students’ perceptions of safe learning environment. The Safe Learning Environment
                                 Survey was designed and distributed to a convenience sample of 360 undergraduate students
                                 at universities in Poland and Vietnam. Results reveal that neither sex nor family
                                 context affect students’ feeling of safety at school. However, there is a high association
                                 with nationality in feeling safe at school. Polish and Vietnamese students differ
                                 in their opinions why safe space should be enhanced as well as what the teacher and
                                 peers’ roles are in shaping safe atmospheres. These findings have significant implications
                                 for multicultural classes: understanding the factors that enhance school safety will
                                 help to form the collaborative and inclusive environment where students’ performance
                                 improves.</span></div>

                              <p id="d1e127">Learning space has been a central topic of pedagogy, traditionally understood as a
                                 physical, brick and mortar learning environment [<a href="#R1">1</a>, <a href="#R2">2</a>] where face-to-face lectures constrained learning in terms of time and space. Numerous
                                 perspectives on learning, such as the Social Learning Theory (e.g. [<a href="#R3">3</a>]), Sociocultural Theory of Learning (e.g. [<a href="#R4">4</a>]), and Situated Learning (e.g. [<a href="#R5">5</a>]), ascertain that most learning takes place beyond formally designated learning spaces
                                 [<a href="#R6">6</a>]. Even though the educational system provides formal instruction in a planned and
                                 organized manner that is imposed by the curriculum, much of the learning takes place
                                 through socializing agents: adults (teachers or other school employees) and peers,
                                 where the development of not only cognitive, but also social and affective dimensions
                                 takes place. Therefore, learning space, or positive space, is a place where students
                                 assimilate knowledge, behavior, and thinking as well as shape their attitudes, norms,
                                 values and opinions through interaction with others. It is frequently an environment
                                 where transition, or in some cases transformation, takes place when students ‘‘experience
                                 a shift or reorientation in their life world’’ [<a href="#R7">7</a>] due to a change in identity or role perception, so that they perceive the world
                                 in a different way. Therefore, it is important that learning space is a safe space
                                 where students feel secure enough to openly express their opinions, share their attitudes,
                                 and take risks so that their performance is enhanced and the outcomes improved. In
                                 this paper, we hope to contribute to the debate about safe space in education by putting
                                 forward a cross-cultural perspective on fostering and maintaining safety in the educational
                                 context globally. It should be mentioned that the expression ‘taking risks’ in education
                                 is related to specific behavior which may encounter negative feedback from social
                                 environments. Such feedback negatively affects interpersonal relations. Safe space
                                 is risk free as it constitutes ‘brave space’, namely, an environment free from abuse
                                 and ridicule. On the other hand, [<a href="#R8">8</a>] argues that real education always involves risk. The author identifies seven key
                                 educational areas: creativity, communication, teaching, learning, emancipation, democracy,
                                 and virtuosity and argues that ‘taking risk’ in adverse conditions may lead to negative
                                 experiences that impede personal and social development in any of the abovementioned
                                 areas.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e154">The cross-cultural perspective will consider two nations: Poland and Vietnam. The
                                 rationale for conducting the comparative research is related to closer Polish-Vietnamese
                                 relations, which concerns educational migration and economic-oriented migration [<a href="#R9">9</a>, <a href="#R10">10</a>]. It will also provide a theoretical framework for other similar comparative research
                                 on this topic.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e162">Understanding the factors that undermine school safety will help to reduce the long-term
                                 negative outcomes of victimization at school and reduce the risk of exposure to an
                                 unsafe school environment. Despite the importance of the topic of school safety, there
                                 remains a paucity of evidence on individual characteristics and school context on
                                 students’ perception of a safe learning environment. Furthermore, there have been
                                 no studies which compare national differences in the perception of school safety.
                                 This paper explores the ways in which the school environment, i.e. teachers, peers,
                                 students themselves, and individual characteristics such as sex nationality and family
                                 affect students’ perceptions of a safe learning environment. This study makes a major
                                 contribution to research in education by demonstrating individual differences in the
                                 perception of school safety. Previously published studies are limited to local surveys
                                 that focus on the low socio-economic context of ethnic groups. This is the first study
                                 to investigate how students with different cultural backgrounds (Polish and Vietnamese)
                                 perceive school safety.

                                    <p id="d1e167">The concept of safe space originates from the 1970s feminist and LGBT movement. It
                                       originally referred to a meeting place where marginalized people could meet and share
                                       their experiences without discrimination [<a href="#R11">11</a>]. Safe space programs or safe zones at schools and universities were established,
                                       e.g. at a classroom or an educator’s office where marginalized youth could feel at
                                       ease and discuss issues that troubled them. Receiving such support, even being aware
                                       that there is a place they could go to find support, helped to build their sense of
                                       self, form a supportive community and cope with bias [<a href="#R12">12</a>]. As a result, communities of people flourished, especially at university campuses
                                       or workplaces, e.g. EQUAL!, an educational and support group in Nokia Corporation
                                       (
                                       https://equal.org/), but also in primary schools in the UK [<a href="#R13">13</a>], US and Canada [<a href="#R14">14</a>]. The communities brought together understanding and trustworthy people who were
                                       supportive of LGBTQIA+ people if they needed advice. More recently, safe space policies
                                       at universities have been criticized for inhibiting the freedom of speech as they
                                       prevent contested issues from being discussed [<a href="#R15">15</a>, <a href="#R16">16</a>].
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e188">Safe-space classrooms in educational institutions differ from the safe-space policy
                                       in higher education institutions or workplaces because the rules and goals of cohabitation
                                       differ [<a href="#R11">11</a>]. Therefore, safe space describes a classroom climate that feels secure, supportive
                                       and risk-free so that students can honestly express their individuality, opinions,
                                       attitudes, knowledge, and behavior [<a href="#R17">17</a>] without fear of being the target of violence, harassment or hate speech. Safety
                                       in this context exceeds physical safety and ‘‘refers to protection from psychological
                                       or emotional harm’’ [<a href="#R17">17</a>]. Safe learning space entails creating a positive atmosphere that encourages students
                                       to break down their isolation, form an inclusive and collaborative classroom community
                                       [<a href="#R12">12</a>, <a href="#R18">18</a>, <a href="#R19">19</a>], which is encouraging for expression without fear of ridicule and supports their
                                       well-being, resilience and moral identity [<a href="#R19">19</a>]. Moreover, a safe learning environment correlates with the performance of students
                                       [<a href="#R20">20</a>], especially in programs for troubled teens [<a href="#R21">21</a>].
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e218">The climate of safe space is the main precondition for both intercultural dialogue
                                       and exploring the diversity of opinions, values and attitudes [<a href="#R22">22</a>, <a href="#R23">23</a>]. Therefore, cultivating safe-space encourages self-disclosure in students despite
                                       the fear of negative consequences following such disclosure [<a href="#R17">17</a>] because a climate of safe space does not entail comfort. In order to develop cognitively,
                                       emotionally and socially, students need to experience challenges and struggles [<a href="#R4">4</a>, <a href="#R24">24</a>]. In an environment where not only knowledge but also identity can be challenged,
                                       students’ learning and creativity can flourish [<a href="#R7">7</a>]. However, a learning space rich in engagement, challenge and struggle will not be
                                       free from conflict. Discussion, especially on controversial issues, may easily steer
                                       from polite to provocative and tensions might arise; that is why [<a href="#R25">25</a>] suggests replacing the concept of safe-space classrooms, which is for him too ambiguous,
                                       with the notion of communities of disagreement, which he defines as ‘‘a group with
                                       identity claims, consisting of people with different opinions, who find themselves
                                       engaged in a common process, in order to solve shared problems or challenges’’. Similarly,
                                       Arao &amp; Clemens [<a href="#R26">26</a>] criticize the concept of safe space for giving students false ideas of safety and
                                       being too closely related to power relations. In turn, the researchers suggest using
                                       the notion of brave space because, in order to engage in authentic learning and dialogue
                                       about diversity, both students and teachers need to be ready to put themselves at
                                       risk and challenge their comfort zones, which requires bravery, not the illusion of
                                       safety. However, regardless of the term used to denote a supportive learning environment,
                                       the researchers emphasize the need to make classrooms pro-social spaces where a variety
                                       of individuals get along and are respectful to one another despite their differences
                                       in race, ethnicity, language, religion, gender, individual or personal qualities.
                                       The climate of safe space therefore entails forming an environment free from abuse,
                                       manipulation and unstable social links, which can be done by developing students’
                                       communication skills [<a href="#R19">19</a>, <a href="#R27">27</a>] and implementing effective classroom management [<a href="#R28">28</a>], including setting ground rules that all students and school staff comply with.
                                       Establishing guidelines for participation and contribution should be the outcome of
                                       shared collaborative work between teachers and students because commonly established
                                       rules help to develop trust and safety [<a href="#R29">29</a>]. Ground rules include using appropriate language devoid of racist, sexist comments
                                       and hate speech, challenging ideas, but not the individuals who express them, justifying
                                       opinions that have been expressed and giving everyone the opportunity to voice their
                                       opinion [<a href="#R23">23</a>], respecting one another, and not taking things personally [<a href="#R26">26</a>].

                                    <p id="d1e267">The structure of a learning space is formed on the one hand by externally imposed
                                       institutional norms, and on the other hand, by the needs and expectations of the community
                                       that has established the space. An environment that is conducive to learning includes
                                       the following components: physical resources (e.g. materials, technology, and the
                                       classroom) and the social groups students interact with [<a href="#R29">29</a>]: teachers and peers. The quality of relationships at school, at home and in the
                                       community plays a significant role in forming a safe and supportive learning space.
                                       In this study, we are going to focus on two elements that form the safe space: the
                                       students themselves (individual context) and their peers, teachers, and family.

                                       have an impact on students’ perception of what safe space is [<a href="#R30">30</a>, <a href="#R31">31</a>]. A larger percentage of primary than secondary school students are afraid of being
                                       attacked or harmed. These findings are, however, inconsistent, because other studies
                                       [<a href="#R32">32</a>, <a href="#R33">33</a>] found that middle and high school students tend to have more school safety concerns
                                       than primary school students.

                                    <p id="d1e289">A higher percentage of male than female students provoked disciplinary incidents,
                                       whereas more female students reported feeling unsafe at school and avoided school
                                       activities or certain places in the school for fear of being attacked or harmed [<a href="#R34">34</a>, <a href="#R35">35</a>]. Female students are more likely to experience gender-related harassment and sexual
                                       crimes, which contributes to them perceiving the school environment as more dangerous
                                       [<a href="#R36">36</a>]. Other studies, however, reveal contrasting results. Akiba [<a href="#R37">37</a>] and Welsh [<a href="#R38">38</a>] provide evidence that more male than female students tend to fear for their safety
                                       at school. Mijanovich and Weitzman [<a href="#R39">39</a>] have not found evidence for any correlation between gender and fears about safety
                                       at school.

                                    <p id="d1e310">The family context can be associated with perceptions of safety at school, in particular
                                       parental involvement with children and feelings of isolation [<a href="#R34">34</a>, <a href="#R40">40</a>]. However, other studies [<a href="#R33">33</a>] found that parental school involvement is not correlated with a perception of school
                                       safety. Students’ low socio-economic status increases the risk of perceiving school
                                       as an unsafe environment [<a href="#R33">33</a>, <a href="#R39">39</a>, <a href="#R41">41</a>]. This may be related to the fact that students with low socio-economic status live
                                       in impoverished areas with higher rates of misbehavior. They are, therefore, more
                                       frequently exposed to bullying and other crimes, which is projected onto feelings
                                       of threat and insecurity at school.

                                       attending disorderly schools that fail to impose regulations are more concerned about
                                       their safety [<a href="#R37">37</a>, <a href="#R38">38</a>, <a href="#R39">39</a>]. The school climate is more strongly correlated with the perception of safety in

                                       which may be related to the fact that these teachers take more interest in their students
                                       [<a href="#R37">37</a>]. Students who enjoy a close relationship with their teachers feel safe at school

                                       [<a href="#R41">41</a>], large school size [<a href="#R43">43</a>] and the presence of school security measures, such as metal detectors, security
                                       guards, and surveillance cameras [<a href="#R44">44</a>]. Significant analysis and discussion on the subject was presented by Juvonen, Nishina
                                       and Graham [<a href="#R45">45</a>] who studied the perception of safety among ethnic minorities. High classroom diversity
                                       not only lowers concerns for their safety among minority students but also empowers
                                       learners to cope more effectively with the emotional effects of threat and stress.

                                       the sharing of common experiences in communities, manifests itself at different layers
                                       of depth. It is expressed in social behavior, norms shared, as well as in knowledge,
                                       beliefs, arts, laws, customs, capabilities, and habits of the individuals. The Hofstede
                                       framework was applied in the cultural analysis of the countries as it was assessed
                                       as stable. The findings suggest that ‘‘although cultural change has occurred, it has
                                       occurred in the same way for all societies, leaving countries’ relative positions
                                       largely unaffected’’ [<a href="#R50">50</a>]. On the basis of the theory of Geert Hofstede [<a href="#R51">51</a>], five dimensions were analyzed: power distance, individualism–collectivism, masculinity–femininity,
                                       uncertainty avoidance, and short-term orientation–long-term orientation. Later, a
                                       sixth dimension, indulgence-restraint, was added [<a href="#R52">52</a>]. Power distance, strength of social hierarchy, is defined as ‘‘the extent to which
                                       the less powerful members of organizations and institutions (like the family) accept
                                       and expect that power is distributed unequally’’ [<a href="#R51">51</a>]; individualism-collectivism—is ‘‘the degree to which people in a society are integrated
                                       into groups’’ [<a href="#R53">53</a>]; masculinity–femininity, task-orientation versus person-orientation, is ‘‘related
                                       to the division of emotional roles between women and men’’ [<a href="#R53">53</a>]; uncertainty avoidance is ‘‘the level of stress in a society in the face of an unknown
                                       future’’; and short-term orientation–long-term orientation, concerns ‘‘the choice
                                       of focus for people’s efforts: the future or the present and past’’. The sixth dimension,
                                       indulgence-restraint orientation refers to ‘‘the gratification versus control of basic
                                       human desires related to enjoying life’’ [<a href="#R53">53</a>]. With regard to the measures, there are six scale intervals (1–20), (21–40), (41–60),
                                       (61–80), (81–100), and (101–120) which are used in describing the intensity of a given
                                       dimension.

                                    <p id="d1e419">Thi &amp; Nguyen [<a href="#R54">54</a>] stress that the Vietnamese values system is affected by the philosophical or religious
                                       systems of Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism. This is reflected in the studious spirit,
                                       family obligations, the desire for reputation, respecting others and harmony. More
                                       specific Confucian values bring respect for social hierarchy, order, and maintaining
                                       social harmony [<a href="#R55">55</a>]. What is more, the Vietnamese have adapted Western values from the French and Americans,
                                       which is reflected in the emergence of individualism, liberty, equality and democracy
                                       [<a href="#R54">54</a>]. The author also notices that due to political conditions, socialist values are
                                       promoted as key rulers of social well-being and prosperousness [<a href="#R54">54</a>]. Any topics which may be seen as inflammatory are rather forced out of social and
                                       political discourse. For instance, the LGBT movement in Vietnam is not legally protected
                                       and the groups are socially marginalized; a heterosexual couple with two children
                                       is the model promoted in the media and politics [<a href="#R56">56</a>].
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e436">Regarding the cultural dimensions analysis, the power distance index (PDI) is 70 for
                                       the Vietnamese, the individualism index (IDV) - 20, masculinity index (MAS) - 40,
                                       uncertainty level index (UAI) - 30 [<a href="#R48">48</a>, <a href="#R52">52</a>], long-term orientation index (LTO) - 57 [<a href="#R54">54</a>], and indulgence-restraint index (IVR) - 35 [<a href="#R52">52</a>]. A high score for the power distance means that the society tends to accept a hierarchical
                                       order with inherent inequalities. The individualism score of 20 is low, which means
                                       that Vietnam is a collectivistic society. In a collectivistic society, loyalty influences
                                       societal rules and regulations, and responsibility for others; any offence causes
                                       shame and loss of face. The index of 40 indicates that Vietnam is a feminine culture,
                                       which is expressed in caring for others and quality of life, equality, solidarity
                                       and quality in their working lives, and compromise. A very low uncertainty level,
                                       i.e. 30, signifies that the Vietnamese tend to establish laws, rules, regulations
                                       and control mechanisms to prevent any ambiguity or risk, and if they are ambiguous
                                       or do not work they should be abandoned or changed. According to Nguyen and Truong
                                       [<a href="#R57">57</a>], on a daily basis, ‘‘Vietnamese people are quite flexible and easy adapt to real-life
                                       situation, sometimes they believe that everything happening depends on fate.’’ The
                                       Vietnamese tend to be characterized as long-term orientated, which refers to family
                                       pragmatism, sustained efforts toward slow results, and revealing respect for circumstances.
                                       It is worth noting that in comparison to other cultures strongly influenced by Confucianism,
                                       it is a significantly low score. In the last dimension, Vietnam is a restrained culture
                                       which is governed by social norms.

                                    <p id="d1e456">Poland, an ex-communist society, with a long but lost history of multiculturalism,
                                       is oriented toward survival and traditional values. The values are closely related
                                       to Catholicism, which affect many areas of life. Some authors even notice that ‘‘interventions
                                       of the Roman Catholic Church in state affairs are made regularly’’ [<a href="#R58">58</a>], or ‘‘religion is central to political identity’’ [<a href="#R59">59</a>]. This significantly shapes the attitude towards inflammatory issues. Similarly to
                                       other post-socialist countries, Poland is characterized by low gender egalitarianism
                                       [<a href="#R60">60</a>, <a href="#R61">61</a>]. With regard to safe space in education, most resources are in Polish and they concentrate
                                       on the general need for taking into account such a concept in culturally diverse environments.
                                       It is more a discourse on the need for cross-cultural education, as well as developing
                                       sensitivity both towards one’s own and foreign culture, which also contributes to
                                       opening a safe space in education. The other characteristics of the society are based
                                       on the six dimensions. For Poland, the PDI is 68, IDV-60, MAS-64, UAI-93, LTO-32,
                                       and IVR-29 [<a href="#R52">52</a>]. In relation to the relatively high PDI, Poland, similar to Vietnam, is a hierarchical
                                       society. The IDV (60) indicates that Poland is an individualist society, where individuals
                                       tend to take care of themselves. As a rather masculine culture, its society is driven
                                       by competition and achievement. A very high UAI reveals that Poland prefers to maintain
                                       control over the future by applying rigid codes of belief and behavior; it is not
                                       tolerant to any kind of unorthodox behavior. The low LTO suggests Poles are more normative
                                       than pragmatic in their thinking and behavior, respecting traditions, tending to believe
                                       in absolute truth, expecting quick results, and because of the restrained culture,
                                       Poles have a tendency to be cynical and pessimistic [<a href="#R62">62</a>].
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e477">It is noticeable that Poland and Vietnam have different backgrounds and experiences
                                       with social diversity. With regard to Hofstede’s analyses of cultural dimensions,
                                       some orientations, such as PDI and IVR are very similar. The remaining dimensions
                                       either differ significantly (IDV, UAI) or in a moderate way (MAS, LTO). The differences
                                       may underlie the perception of safe space in education.

                                 environment, individual characteristics and family in shaping students’ perceptions
                                 of a safe learning environment? We hypothesize that female students with a low socio-economic
                                 status and with low parental closeness perceive the school environment as unsafe (H1).
                                 Furthermore, we think that students’ perceptions on safe space in education vary across

The survey comprised 58 questions divided into 3 sections (see appendix <a href="#TabA1">A1</a>). The first section contained 43 Likert-scale questions addressing school-level factors
                                 (teachers, peers and students themselves) on students’ perception of safe space in
                                 education. The impact of teachers either enhanced the positive space, which was measured
                                 with 10 items (positive space - teacher scale) or it resulted in unsafe perceptions
                                 of the school environment, which was measured with 6 items (negative space - teacher
                                 scale). Similarly, the impact of peers on safety perception was either positive, which
                                 was measured with 6 items (positive space - peers scale) or negative, which was measured
                                 with 5 items (negative space - peers scale). Students themselves also play a role
                                 in creating class atmosphere. A positive impact was measured with 9 items (positive
                                 space - self scale) whereas a negative impact was measured with 4 items (negative
                                 space - self scale). The questions were multiple choice questions and the respondents
                                 could select any number of answers.

                                 Finally, the survey included 5 items referring to individual characteristics of the

                                 students in Poland. Based on the research analysis, some of the original questions

                                       the answers. Inferential statistics were used to investigate differences among the
                                       variables. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov and the Shapiro-Wilk tests for normality were employed
                                       to assess the distribution of the data. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to derive
                                       conclusions about significant differences between dependent measures as a function
                                       of specific demographic variables including sex, socio-economic status, family closeness
                                       and nationality.

                                 Polish (61.4%) and Vietnamese (38.6%). 12.5% of the sample were of low socio-economic
                                 status for whom both parents’ occupation was either employed part-time, unemployed
                                 or unable to work. At the family level, the mean score of the low parental closeness
                                 was 58.9%.

                              <p id="d1e515">The distribution of PSS, NSS, PS and NST is more symmetrical; however, the SD is high
                                 for all scales. The distribution of data is therefore highly varied. Variables representing
                                 the school level factors were teacher attitude, peers’ attitude and the attitude of
                                 the students themselves. The respondents from Poland most frequently marked the following
                                 three features of the teacher that contributed to safe space at school: being respectful
                                 and supportive (31.1% of the Polish respondents marked this answer), unbiased and
                                 non-judgmental (24.4%), challenging students and posing questions (23.3%). The Vietnamese
                                 students marked the following three teacher qualities as contributing to a positive
                                 atmosphere at school: being informative and knowledgeable (19.4%), being respectful
                                 and supportive (15.8%), being friendly and caring (15.5%). Both Polish and Vietnamese
                                 students agreed that the following teacher features disrupted the perception of safety
                                 at school: being biased, opinionated or judgmental (indicated by 27.2% of Polish students
                                 and 25% of Vietnamese students) and being critical, chastising students and shooting
                                 down their ideas (indicated by 25% of Polish students and 23% of Vietnamese students).

                              <p id="d1e517">The behavior and attitude of classmates may promote the feeling of safety at school,
                                 especially if they honestly share thoughts, ideas, opinions, and facts (according
                                 to 35.5% of Polish and 20.5% of Vietnamese respondents), have positive attitudes (24.1%
                                 Polish and 23.6% of Vietnamese students), and are respectful, listen and follow ground
                                 rules (23.6% of Polish and 21.6% of Vietnamese respondents). The behavior of peers
                                 also compromises the feeling of safety. According to Polish students, it is disruptive
                                 when classmates try to please the teacher (this answer was given by 36.6% of the respondents),
                                 are biased, judgmental or close-minded (32.5%) and frustrated, angry or hostile (23.8%).
                                 For Vietnamese students, safety at school is compromised if classmates do not speak
                                 or are afraid to speak (28.8%), are apathetic about the course (27.2%) and try to
                                 please the teacher (22.2%).
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e519">Safety at school is promoted when students themselves are open-minded and consider
                                 the views of their classmates (30.5% of Polish and 18.8% of Vietnamese respondents),
                                 honestly share ideas, views and values (22.7% of Polish and 13.8% of Vietnamese respondents),
                                 and are supportive and respectful towards others (19.1% of Polish and 21.3% of Vietnamese
                                 respondents). On the other hand, safety is compromised when students are not confident
                                 (31.3% of Polish and 33% of Vietnamese respondents), are fearful, worried, intimidated
                                 and insecure (29.4% of Polish and 24.1% of Vietnamese respondents), and do not invest
                                 in the course (30.8% of Polish and 22.5% of Vietnamese respondents).

                              <p id="d1e521">Both Polish and Vietnamese students believe that it is important to create safe space
                                 in the classroom where students can freely speak their mind (48.6% of Polish and 37.7%
                                 of Vietnamese students agree with this option).

                              <p id="d1e523">The Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic takes a value between 0.119 and 0.405 (Table <a href="#Tab1">1</a>), whilst the Shapiro-Wilk statistic takes a value between 0.646 and 0.952. The p-value
                                 is 0.000. Therefore, we reject the hypothesis that the variable follows a normal distribution.
                                 The Shapiro-Wilk’s test agrees with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov p-value &lt; 0.05. The skewness ranges from 0.225 to 1.170. The skewness value for the PSS and
                                 NSS scales is approximately symmetric. For other scales, the skewness is high but
                                 acceptable.

                              <p id="d1e832">This study set out to investigate the perception and experience of safe learning space.
                                 There were two general hypotheses developed for the study. First, we hypothesize that
                                 female students with low socio-economic status and with low parental closeness perceive
                                 the school environment as unsafe (H1). However, this hypothesis is not supported by
                                 the data. Firstly, the results show that there are no gender differences in the way
                                 in which students perceive a safe atmosphere in the classroom, which is in line with
                                 [<a href="#R39">39</a>], who have not found evidence for correlation between gender and school safety fears.
                                 Other studies, however, have produced contrasting results. They [<a href="#R33">33</a>, <a href="#R35">35</a>, <a href="#R36">36</a>] found that female students are more likely to experience violence; therefore, girls
                                 report feeling unsafe at school; whereas, [<a href="#R37">37</a>] and Welsh [<a href="#R38">38</a>] have proved that male students more frequently perceive school as an unsafe environment.
                                 Secondly, concerning the family context, we have not found any correlation between
                                 parental involvement and the perception of safety, which is consistent with Hong and
                                 Eamon’s study [<a href="#R33">33</a>] but in contrast with [<a href="#R34">34</a>] and [<a href="#R40">40</a>]. Finally, in contrast to earlier studies [<a href="#R33">33</a>, <a href="#R39">39</a>, <a href="#R41">41</a>] we have not found any correlation between students’ socio-economic status and feeling
                                 safe at school.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e872">As mentioned earlier, no studies were found on how students from different cultural
                                 backgrounds perceive school safety. The results of the study revealed that there is
                                 a significant difference in the opinions in relation to the nationality of the students;
                                 therefore, the second hypothesis (H2: students’ perceptions on safe space in education
                                 varies across cultures) has been supported. First, students differ in their opinions
                                 on why safe space should be created. The Polish students would like to form space
                                 at school for speaking their mind freely and discussing controversial issues. The
                                 Polish and Vietnamese students differ in their perception of the teacher’s role in
                                 the classroom. For the Polish students, it is important that the teacher is respectful,
                                 supportive, open, is not biased nor judgmental, and encourages class participation.
                                 For the Vietnamese students, on the other hand, teachers build safe space if they
                                 are informative, knowledgeable, respectful and supportive. The respondents also differed
                                 in their opinions on disruptive teacher behavior. Teachers’ reliance on the didactic
                                 format being abrupt or rude is more inconvenient for the Polish rather than the Vietnamese
                                 students. Both groups of students agree that teachers being critical towards students
                                 and biased and opinionated disrupts safety in the classroom. These differences may
                                 be accounted for in the educational experience of both groups. Polish students are
                                 invited to share opinions in the classroom despite the dominant traditional teaching
                                 style. However, in Vietnam, respect for authority and the collectivist culture result
                                 in an expectation that the teacher is the center of the classroom and the students
                                 listen in silence. Vietnamese students therefore do not feel insecure when their opinions
                                 are not required or sought after by the teacher, but might feel threatened by a teacher
                                 who positions the student at the center of a lecture.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e874">The respondents also differed in their perception of the role of their peers in shaping
                                 atmosphere as the Poles believe that sharing thoughts and ideas mostly promotes a
                                 positive atmosphere, whereas the Vietnamese students pointed at the need for their
                                 classmates to have positive attitudes. This is reflected in cross-cultural differences
                                 where the Poles are increasingly individualistic, whilst Vietnamese culture is feminine
                                 and collectivist. Furthermore, Poland’s educational system is focused on developing
                                 critical cognitive skills through individual work and high competitiveness, whilst
                                 schools in Vietnam foster unity and agreement in order to avoid conflict and challenges
                                 in order to maintain social harmony and societal rules.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e876">Finally, the students differ in their opinion on their own role in shaping positive
                                 and negative space at school. The Polish students believe that being open-minded and
                                 honestly sharing ideas leads to a feeling of safety, whereas the Vietnamese students
                                 are more supportive towards others. The answer to this question clearly shows cross-cultural
                                 differences between the two groups. The Vietnamese students find it important to maintain
                                 social harmony, whilst the Poles are more self-assured, outspoken, and active in their
                                 pursuit of justice and fairness for the individual.

                              <p id="d1e881">The aim of the study was to investigate the associations between different individual
                                 student characteristics and the formation of safe educational space in a sample of
                                 undergraduate students from Poland and Vietnam. In particular, the study examined
                                 the effect of sex, nationality, and family context on students’ perception of a safe
                                 learning environment. The study indicated that neither sex nor family context affects
                                 students’ feeling of safety at school. However, feeling secure at school is considerably
                                 associated with nationality. Culture is therefore the key to understanding the perspectives
                                 which govern the principles underlying the approach to safe space in education. Not
                                 only do students from different cultural backgrounds have a different experience of
                                 how teachers and peers affect the formation of learning space at school, but they
                                 also have different expectations towards their own role in shaping a safe atmosphere
                                 at school.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e883">These findings have significant implications for an understanding of how to shape
                                 a safe learning space. Feeling safe, supportive and risk-free is a prerequisite to
                                 forming an environment where students can assimilate knowledge, behavior, and thinking,
                                 as well as shape their attitudes, norms, values and opinions; consequently, it improves
                                 students’ performance [<a href="#R7">7</a>, <a href="#R21">21</a>, <a href="#R63">63</a>]. In a safe environment, students are encouraged to break out of their isolation,
                                 form collaborating classroom communities [<a href="#R12">12</a>, <a href="#R19">19</a>], and express themselves without fear. This is in line with the concept of cultural
                                 safety, which incorporates ‘‘an environment that is spiritually, socially and emotionally
                                 safe, as well as physically safe for people; where there is no assault challenge or
                                 denial of their identity, of who they are and what they need’’ [<a href="#R61">61</a>]. Enhancing cultural safety entails not only treating every individual with respect
                                 but also empowering students to become more self-confident and effective as learners.
                                 Adopting such an approach will eventually enhance human security, and, as a result,
                                 ease tensions and intercultural conflicts [<a href="#R62">62</a>, <a href="#R64">64</a>]. Therefore, goals such as promoting respect for diversity and encouraging the student
                                 voice, as well as enhancing cultural awareness and competences, need to shape the
                                 hidden curriculum. It is important that learning space is a safe space where students
                                 feel secure to openly express their opinions, share their attitudes, and take risks
                                 so that their performance was enhanced and outcomes improved.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e910">One source of weakness in this study which could have affected the findings was the
                                 small sample size. Future studies might carry out the analysis on a larger population.
                                 Another limitation is the overrepresentation of students from Poland, which was substantially
                                 higher than of students from Vietnam. The study also did not include age as a factor
                                 that might affect the perception of safe space. The last major limitation is that
                                 the theory of G. Hofstede was applied for our analyses; therefore, the conceptualization
                                 of culture reflected the interpretations of differences between Poland and Vietnam.
                                 Given the increasingly multicultural classrooms all over the world, the findings of
                                 the study have important implications for enhancing the education of students that
                                 are from different cultural backgrounds. Understanding the factors that undermine
                                 school safety helps to reduce the long-term negative outcomes of victimization at
                                 school and lower the risk of exposure to unsafe school environments. Developing school
                                 safety programs enhances school safety, supports the creation of cooperative school
                                 structure, supports relationships with peers and reinforces the appropriate behavior
                                 of both teachers and all school personnel. Furthermore, other studies suggest the
                                 need to establish and enforce fair rules to enhance school safety [<a href="#R33">33</a>, <a href="#R41">41</a>], development of community programs aimed at reducing violence in the neighborhood
                                 [<a href="#R65">65</a>], and intervening at the family, school and community levels [<a href="#R33">33</a>]. Further work is needed to fully understand how students from different cultural
                                 backgrounds perceive and experience a safe learning environment, in particular the
                                 role of their teachers, of their peers and their own role in shaping the atmosphere
                                 at school. The correlation between school safety and individual characteristics or
                                 school context is complex.
