                                 the world both in developed and developing countries. Similarly, Information and Communication
                                 Technologies (ICTs) have been embraced by many developed countries to augment COP
                                 initiatives. However, very little is known about the application of ICTs in COP in
                                 developing countries, particularly South Asia. In this article, we review the current
                                 ICT-based COP initiatives by focusing on some of the selected projects from developed
                                 countries and South Asia. The paper has used COP in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province
                                 of Pakistan as a case. While meaningful insights can be derived through learning from
                                 the experiences of developed countries, we highlight some major issues and challenges
                                 that are likely to be faced while implementing ICT based COP in South Asia. Moreover,
                                 we provide an overview of some exciting opportunities that arise as a result of embracing
                                 ICTs to enhance COP efforts for building trusting community-police relations and hence
                                 improving human security in the region.</span></div>

                              <p id="d1e115">The police is considered the most visible and interactive face of government authority
                                 [<a href="#R01">1</a>]. Over the past decades, a number of innovative and interesting policing models,
                                 such as smart policing[<a href="#R02">2</a>], hot spots policing [<a href="#R03">3</a>], evidence-based policing [<a href="#R04">4</a>], problem-oriented policing [<a href="#R05">5</a>], intelligence-led policing [<a href="#R06">6</a>], and Community-oriented policing (COP)[<a href="#R07">7</a>, <a href="#R08">8</a>] have been introduced. COP is one of the most widely discussed initiatives that has
                                 gained popularity in various parts of the world [<a href="#R09">9</a>, <a href="#R10">10</a>]. The objective of COP is to include the local community in decision and policy making
                                 to build trust and improve human security through interactive exchange of information
                                 [<a href="#R11">11</a>, <a href="#R12">12</a>, <a href="#R13">13</a>]. COP can be helpful in (a) engaging local communities in problem-solving, (b) combating
                                 crime, (c) building trust between police and communities (d) decreasing fear in citizens
                                 of being victimized, (e) public security information dissemination, and (f) augmenting
                                 limited police resources. COP aims to build an environment of trust and vigilance
                                 between community and police to improve human security by focusing resources on identifying
                                 and reducing chances for crime instead of chasing and catching criminals. The ideal
                                 candidates to identify and eliminate insecurities are not the police, but common citizens
                                 that know the area, people and circumstances they live in. On the other hand, despite
                                 the police having the legal right to utilize physical force, they have limited capability
                                 to proactively identify and reduce crime. Therefore, police need to develop a partnership
                                 with complementary resources including local community and civil society organizations
                                 [<a href="#R14">14</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e161">In this article, we aim to review how means, i.e., police, community, and ICTs might
                                 be leveraged for community-oriented policing (proximal end), which in turn could lead
                                 to achieve one or more ultimate ends that include human security, the protection of
                                 human rights, and improvement in trust between police and the community (see Figure
                                 <a href="#Fig1">1</a>). The focus of this work is to analyze various COP initiatives that are being taken
                                 in different regions of South Asia to built trust between community and police and
                                 improve human security.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e166">Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), such as smart phones, computers,
                                 and the Internet have the potential to support COP in that they can provide opportunities
                                 for extended participation and consultation of the local community in policing. ICT
                                 in COP in developing countries can also: (a) improve communications between police
                                 and community, (b) identify a wider variety of insecurities that are context based
                                 (c) effectively utilize limited resources through targeted policing, (d) move beyond
                                 the customary bureaucratic procedures (e) improve participation of women, minorities,
                                 and vulnerable population in COP, and (f) contribute to empowerment of the community.
                                 ICT-based COP should have the capacity and technology to identify and respond to local
                                 challenges.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e168">While the potential of using ICT in COP in developing countries is promising, it can
                                 at the same time face significant ethical and socio-economic challenges. The use of
                                 ICTs can, for example, give the police quick access to huge data and information,
                                 such as wanted criminals, crime history of a criminal, digital fingerprints, stolen
                                 vehicles, traffic violations, and information on firearms, that could contribute to
                                 more effective crime prevention, reporting and response. Access to a large volume
                                 of public data and information could, however, be misused by authorities for targeting
                                 vulnerable groups and individuals, and would require both an accountable and depoliticized
                                 police, as well as technical capacity to ensure proper data privacy and protection
                                 measures. Socio-economic constraints on both the police and public can also be significant,
                                 limiting access to devices, as well as one’s capacity to use ICTs due to, for example,
                                 limited literacy and access to training.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e170">In general, the majority of the literature related to ICTs in COP is devoted to the
                                 experiences and projects conducted in developed countries. There are very few works
                                 reported in the literature about the experiences and projects conducted or being conducted
                                 in developing countries, and in particular in South Asian countries including: India,
                                 Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and Pakistan. To the best of our knowledge, there is no comprehensive
                                 study that provides a detailed review and analysis of recent initiatives in the domain
                                 of ICT for COP. A main objective of this study is to fill this gap, posing the question:
                                 What is the state-of-the-art in the use of information and communication technologies
                                 for COP in South Asia? Through this exercise, we wish to gain better insight in the
                                 potential use of ICTs in community-oriented policing in South Asia. In doing so, we
                                 analyze potential challenges and opportunities that can arise while integrating ICTs
                                 in COP and related activities in developing countries of South Asia.

                              <p id="d1e207">According to Nalla and Mamayek [<a href="#R11">11</a>], the majority of the top 20 democratic countries of the world have included community
                                 members in the process of overseeing the police. They claim that this reflects the
                                 importance of civilian participation in police accountability in democratic societies,
                                 something which leads to increased public satisfaction as well as improved police-community
                                 relationships [<a href="#R11">11</a>]. The ways in which community members interact with the police in order to ensure
                                 accountability, trust, and constructive communication, however, vary according to
                                 the local historical and cultural context. Nevertheless, there are several types of
                                 activities that can be identified in many of the contexts where COP has been implemented.

                                       relations as well as reducing crime rate and fear of crime in communities. This contrasts
                                       with a traditional policing model where the police are available at the police stations
                                       and people are to required visit police station to report the crime. In COP models,
                                       police officials often perform regular patrols, on foot or vehicle, to meet and interact
                                       with the community. Moreover, it is believed that continuous and regular presence
                                       of police in neighborhoods has been found to have a positive impact on police-community
                                       relationship because people feel more comfortable to approach and share their concerns
                                       with a person that they are familiar with. Similarly, presence of police in the neighborhood
                                       may also act as a deterring factor to reduce crime [<a href="#R18">18</a>].

                                       the traditional policing model. A brief comparative analysis between traditional policing
                                       and COP is given in Table <a href="#Tab1">1</a>.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e271">In summary, COP emphasizes participation of community in the prevention of crimes,
                                       in contrast to traditional policing that focuses on crime fighting and law enforcement
                                       as a response to crime. Some studies have shown that COP may have limited effect on
                                       crime reduction, but COP features, such as accountability, transparency, and public
                                       feedback may have positive impact on trust in the police and citizen satisfaction
                                       [<a href="#R13">13</a>]. Traditional or standard models of policing involve maintaining order, service provision,
                                       crime reduction, and conflict resolution with little or no consultation with the community.
                                       In contrast, COP is a problem-solving process that draws upon active citizen participation
                                       in identifying and solving causes of disorder, crime, and fear in the community.

                                    <p id="d1e276">An essential feature of the traditional policing model is the use of force by the
                                       police to apprehend criminals. The reasoning behind this is that offenders do not
                                       like to get caught and to be punished [<a href="#R14">14</a>]. It is also believed that given the opportunity, offenders will resist and, consequently,
                                       police must apply force to overcome the resistance. It is this application of force
                                       that raises concerns related to human rights. Human rights training guides the police
                                       on how to apply force while catching the offenders or protecting themselves. There
                                       can be, however, a contradiction between the theory of applying force and adhering
                                       to human rights principles. The police are often faced with situations where they
                                       need to either apply force or respect human rights, and in the end they may fail to
                                       do their basic job of catching offenders [<a href="#R14">14</a>]. While using force may allow police to catch offenders, it does not necessarily
                                       prevent crime. A traditional policing model allows the police to use powers in whichever
                                       way they consider appropriate to catch the offenders, which makes police less accountable.
                                       In a COP model, however, the police establish a partnership with the community to
                                       proactively eliminate crime. Police and the local community jointly work to identify
                                       and solve local problems. The partnership between police and community not only makes
                                       the police more responsive to local problems but also makes them more accountable
                                       in exercising their powers to use force and adhering to human rights.

                                    <p id="d1e287">COP has been implemented in various parts of Asia, such as Japan, China, Singapore,
                                       India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Pakistan just to name a few [<a href="#R19">19</a>]. However, COP models vary in different regions significantly due to the social,
                                       economic, historical, and political context of local communities and the structure
                                       of the police. If a COP model is applied in another context, it would need to be adjusted
                                       according to the local context. For instance, the Japanese COP model, Koban, was imported
                                       to Singapore where it was reconstructed according to local norms as Neighboring Police
                                       Posts [<a href="#R20">20</a>]. In turn, the Singapore COP model was implanted in some Indian states, such as Goa,
                                       Tamil Nadhu, and Uttar Pradesh [<a href="#R20">20</a>]. According to Nalla and Madan [<a href="#R21">21</a>], 12 states in India have over the past decade adopted COP models to improve police-community
                                       relationships and address local problems. Similarly, there are efforts underway in
                                       Sri Lanka [<a href="#R22">22</a>] to implement COP in certain urban and rural regions of the country [<a href="#R15">15</a>]. However, it has been observed that the COP model chosen has proved to be more effective
                                       in rural areas of Sri Lanka where the local community is more supportive of the initiative
                                       compared to the urban areas [<a href="#R23">23</a>].

                                    <p id="d1e381">Bangladesh has also taken steps to introduce COP. In this regard, COP initiatives
                                       are taken in various divisions, such as Rangpur and Rajshahi [<a href="#R25">25</a>, <a href="#R26">26</a>]. In recent years, significant advances have been made by Bangladesh police to incorporate
                                       COP in organizational structure and policy making. These advancements indicate a positive
                                       trend in adopting COP as an institutional culture. Moreover, many policy documents
                                       and guidelines have been developed to support implementation efforts. However, it
                                       is unclear to what extent these policies have been implemented in the field. In many
                                       cases, the implementation efforts depend on the personal motivation and commitment
                                       of police officers (an important point to keep in mind when addressing corruption
                                       issues). Similarly, consistent political support and incentives are required for long-lasting
                                       implementation of COP. Moreover, there is a lack of understanding and misconceptions
                                       among police officials, especially at lower levels, about the interpretation of COP
                                       in the field [<a href="#R25">25</a>]. Even some police officials believe that COP entails that police relinquish some
                                       of their power and functions to community, and that will deprive police from the authority
                                       required to control crime [<a href="#R27">27</a>]. In this context, motivation of political and police leadership to provide sustainable
                                       budgetary and moral support is considered essential. Further, there is no data available
                                       on the role and usage of ICTs in strengthening the implementation of COP in Bangladesh.

                                    <p id="d1e395">The Ministry of Interior Afghanistan (MoIA) envisioned a ten-year program to reform
                                       national police from a ‘militarized’ force to a ‘service’ unit with COP and ICTs at
                                       the heart of this plan [<a href="#R28">28</a>]. To this end, MoIA launched a radio channel “Radio Police” with the aim to improve
                                       contact and communication between police and community. In 2009, a community policing
                                       pilot project was launched in consultation with various stakeholders including civil
                                       society, parliamentarians, academics, NGOs, media, and community members representing
                                       vulnerable groups, such as ethnic minorities, women, and children. Continued involvement
                                       of civil society organizations led to the implementation of Afghanistan Democratic
                                       Policing Project (ADPP). Initiated in 2013, ADPP was a three-year project involving
                                       national and international NGOs focusing on improving police-community relations.
                                       Although one can argue that current efforts of MoIA are very limited, such measures
                                       can play a considerable role in improving trust and the relationship between police
                                       and community despite the insurmountable challenges currently being faced by the conflict
                                       and post-conflict society of Afghanistan [<a href="#R28">28</a>].

                                    <p id="d1e403">Presently, COP units have been established in eight provinces of Afghanistan including
                                       Kabul, Balkh, Kunduz, Baghlan, Bamiyan, Ghor, Herat, and Helmand. In Afghanistan,
                                       COP units are called ‘Police-e Mardume’. They are a part of the regular police force
                                       and perform routine police obligations too. Activities practiced by ‘Police-e Mardume’
                                       [<a href="#R29">29</a>] include community-police consultation sessions, 119 hotline, sport events, mobile
                                       teams, school and university outreach programs (supported by EUPOL, GIZ, LOTFA), joint

                                    <p id="d1e408">In addition to COP, the local or tribal ‘Shura’ is an informal security provider that
                                       may include night and neighborhood watch boards. A civil society organization carried
                                       out a project in northern provinces of Afghanistan during which Shuras were helped
                                       to establish <i>‘neighborhood watch committees’</i>. Similarly, neighbor watch groups established in the Nimruz province proved to be
                                       effective in improving security situation at night. It must be noted here that these
                                       neighborhood/night watch committees are more focused towards crime prevention rather
                                       than fighting terrorism and counterinsurgency. Shuras not only establish neighborhood
                                       watch committees but also look after conflict resolution by involving community elders.
                                       Although these are informal institutions, they can as well link with COP to improve
                                       police community relations.

                                    <p id="d1e413">COP has been implemented in many regions of Pakistan adopting different models. For
                                       instance, in the province of Sindh, and particularly in the city of Karachi, Citizens
                                       Police Liaison Committees (CPLCs) have been established [<a href="#R30">30</a>]. The primary goal of CPLC is to take preventive measures to improve the deteriorating
                                       situation of law and order with the coordination of law enforcement agencies. CPLC
                                       is a unique initiative of community-police partnership where citizens volunteer their
                                       services and take charge to maintain law and order. The focus of CPLCs is to provide
                                       technical assistance to law enforcement agencies for crime prevention and monitoring
                                       using ICTs, such as computerized sketching, crime pattern recognition, and mobile
                                       phone tracking to name a few. CPLC has started Neighborhood Care (NC) projects in
                                       different areas of Karachi to improve safety and security through close liaison between
                                       residents and police. The NC project resulted in significant decrease in heinous street
                                       crimes along with other neighborhood maintenance operations. Historical data shows
                                       a more than 90% reduction in crimes, such as burglaries, mugging, and other street
                                       crimes. In addition to Karachi, CPLCs have also been established in other cities of
                                       the country, such as Faisalabad, Lahore, Sargodha, and Peshawar. Similarly, in 2011
                                       Inspector General of Police (IGP) Sindh introduced the concept of Community Policing
                                       Centers (CPCs). The objective of establishing CPCs was to facilitate liaison between
                                       police and local community to control the street crimes in the province. However,
                                       despite the initial establishment of 160 CPCs, the initiative did not continue due
                                       to lack of resources and personnel. To promote COP in the capital city of Islamabad
                                       Citizen Police Coordination Committees (CPCCs) were established. The aim of CPCC is
                                       to: (a) improve police-community relations, (b) monitor activities at police stations,
                                       (c) provide suggestions to improve traditional police station culture, (d) report
                                       non-cognizable cases. Non-cognizable cases (e.g., assault, cheating, and forgery)
                                       are those wherein a police officer has no authority to arrest without a warrant, and
                                       (e) resolve minor civil disputes through arbitration [<a href="#R31">31</a>].

                                    <p id="d1e421">Another interesting initiative has been launched by district police of Khanewal in
                                       Punjab province of Pakistan to implement COP at Union Council (UC) level. In this
                                       model each UC is considered a ‘beat’. In each beat, crime control and reconciliation
                                       committees are created comprising up to 10 members including a beat in-charge police
                                       officer and community members. The role of the crime control committee is to identify
                                       crimes, criminals, crime hotspots, and information gathering. Reconciliation committees
                                       on the other hand assist the police in resolving disputes at local level [<a href="#R32">32</a>]. The UC-based beat initiative became successful and received support from local
                                       community and police departments in terms of appreciation and resources. Consequently,
                                       the UC-based beat model has been implemented in other three districts of Multan region
                                       including Vehari, Lodhran, and Multan. Moreover, the Punjab police chief is considering
                                       replicating the UC based beat model across the province and in this regard feedback
                                       has been sought from other districts.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e426">In various other parts of the region, some form of community based policing is already
                                       present but with a distinction from the model currently present in western countries,
                                       such as USA, UK, and Canada. For instance, in contemporary China, mass-line policing
                                       is followed [<a href="#R33">33</a>]. The mass-line policing model can be simply defined as <i>‘for the masses, relying on the masses, from the masses and to the masses’</i> [<a href="#R34">34</a>]. Similarly, in various parts of Pakistan and India the traditional <i>“Jirga”</i> or <i>“Panchayat”</i> system is adopted to resolve issues at village level [<a href="#R35">35</a>, <a href="#R36">36</a>]. In Gujranwala district of the Punjab province, Pakistan, for example, villages
                                       effectively linked police with community meetings based on the traditional <i>‘panchayat’</i> system of community elders [<a href="#R35">35</a>]. The COP model was based on two tiers. On the first tier, community meetings are
                                       held in villages, where community members can express their concerns and share opinions
                                       with village elders, police, and council members. The second tier consists of <i>‘chowkidars’</i>; local residents responsible for bridging the gap between police and community. <i>Chowkidars</i> are given the charge to tackle the confrontational disputes in villages and provide
                                       information and intelligence to the police [<a href="#R35">35</a>]. Similarly, local peace committees (LPCs) initiatives made a significant contribution
                                       towards maintaining peace in the conflict-affected district of Lower Dir in KP province
                                       [<a href="#R37">37</a>]. LPCs bridge the gap between local community and state authorities by providing
                                       information, identifying miscreants, and reporting subversive activities in the neighborhood.
                                       In the recent past, LPCs played a role in providing social justice and fighting militancy
                                       in some of the terrorism affected areas of KP. However, it must be noted that LPCs
                                       may not be considered as CoP but an extended system of informants. In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
                                       (KP), police have moved beyond these informal institutions and started an initiative
                                       to formalize the involvement of local community by introducing Dispute Resolution
                                       Councils (DRC) across the province [<a href="#R38">38</a>]. For instance, DRCs established in difference cities of KP province solved more
                                       than 7,000 cases while 1,465 cases were referred to relevant legal forums for action
                                       in the year 2017 [<a href="#R39">39</a>]. DRCs aim to provide free and fast justice to citizens in petty civil cases. DRC
                                       members represent a cross-section of the local community, including retired civil
                                       and military officers, educationists, retired judges, religious scholars, professionals,
                                       businessmen, and journalists. They meet in a designated room within the police stations,
                                       where a police officer is assigned to ensure the meetings are held and followed up.

                                    <p id="d1e475">Tabular analysis of COP projects in Pakistan in terms of services provided by these
                                       projects and anticipated objectives is presented in Table <a href="#Tab2">2</a> and Table <a href="#Tab3">3</a>, respectively. In Table <a href="#Tab2">2</a>, we see that there is no information to the public while most initiatives provide

                                       seen in Table 3 that people are still feeling insecure (victimized). Whereas, common
                                       objectives of all the initiatives include engaging local community in problem solving.

                                    <p id="d1e487">Similarly, there are COP initiatives taken in other countries of South Asia, such
                                       as Nepal [<a href="#R40">40</a>] and Maldives [<a href="#R41">41</a>]. In case of Nepal, the initiatives are not widespread and a significant proportion
                                       of local community is either unaware of the existence of COP or do not understand
                                       how COP works. In the Maldives on the other hand, police have a proactive approach
                                       for reducing crime and incorporate COP through interaction with community elders,
                                       youth, parents, and business owners. COP in Maldives is more focused on reducing gang-related
                                       violence that is also linked with drug trafficking. The Maldives police started an
                                       interesting initiative to engage local youth and even gang members in sports activities,
                                       such as soccer. According to police, these sports events have proven to be effective
                                       in building trust and improving relationships with local youth. Another initiative
                                       by the Maldives police is the establishment of crime prevention committees with the

                                    <p id="d1e750">Women police are often considered better communicators compared to male colleagues,
                                       exhibiting better interpersonal skills. According to studies conducted in the US,
                                       women police officers are preferred by community members to respond and defuse potentially
                                       dangerous situations [<a href="#R42">42</a>]. As the focus of policing shifts from a forceful, physical model to a service model,
                                       and women’s roles in society have become less rigid, arguments of women being unsuitable
                                       for the police are becoming less prevalent. Communities now demand more interaction
                                       with police in non-traditional less enforcing matters, such as crime prevention, youth
                                       interaction, and presence of police personnel in the neighborhood [<a href="#R43">43</a>]. Better communication and interpersonal skills are thus in greater demand, which
                                       are often more associated with women police. Moreover, research studies show that
                                       women have more respect for citizens and generally are more supportive of community
                                       policing principles [<a href="#R42">42</a>].
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e761">Similarly, women police have proven to be more effective in handling complaints of
                                       domestic violence. A fundamental aspect of community policing is that it should reflect,
                                       understand, and appreciate varying experiences within the community. Since domestic
                                       violence is mostly experienced by women, it is reasonable to believe that women police
                                       are better positioned to respond to such cases [<a href="#R44">44</a>]. According to Gilmore and Srivastava [<a href="#R44">44</a>], policewomen are less likely to use excessive force, be involved in allegations,
                                       receive bribes, and engage in corruption. Consequently, increasing the percentage
                                       of women in police is likely to reduce the complaints against police and can have
                                       positive impact on police-community relationships [<a href="#R44">44</a>, <a href="#R45">45</a>].

                                    <p id="d1e775">In South Asia, there have been a few community policing initiatives specifically targeted
                                       to address the security issues faced by women. For instance, a one-year pilot project
                                       was launched in two cities of India (Hyderabad and Chennai) to make public spaces
                                       secure and safe for women with the help of teams comprising police and student volunteers
                                       [<a href="#R46">46</a>]. Similarly, many model police stations have been established in different cities
                                       of KP province of Pakistan. These model police stations have women’s desks where trained
                                       women staff deal with the complaints from women and assist them in legal processes
                                       [<a href="#R47">47</a>]. Dispute Resolution Councils (DRCs) are also established at model police stations
                                       as an alternate dispute resolution mechanism comprising community leaders and elders.
                                       However, there is little representation of women in the DRCs, which makes it less

                                    <p id="d1e824">In 2004, police forces of two Dutch regions launched a communication service termed
                                       <i>SMS-alert</i> [<a href="#R51">51</a>]. This particular COP initiative aimed to improve the service delivery and interaction
                                       with the citizens. SMS-alert was designed as a location-based service that works by
                                       informing and mobilizing citizens in an early stage of an incident. For instance,
                                       in case of a missing child or a robbery in a specific area the people in the proximity
                                       are alerted through SMS. Moreover, in SMS-alert service citizens are not mere receivers
                                       of the information but they also act as co-producers of public safety. In this way
                                       citizens act as eyes and ears of police, actively participating in the reduction and
                                       prevention of crimes in the neighborhood. With the success of SMS-alert in two police
                                       departments of Netherlands, after three years, seven more departments of the region
                                       adopted the SMS-alert service with several more interested to adopt in the near future.
                                       According to Korteland and Bekkers [<a href="#R51">51</a>], the factors that contributed to the success of SMS-alert and its adoption by other
                                       police forces include: <b>(a)</b> marketing by the project manager, <b>(b)</b> experience sharing, and <b>(c)</b> coverage by media. Similarly, the authors also highlight the fact that in certain
                                       police forces the adoption of <i>SMS-alert</i> was hindered due to another competing technology termed <i>Burgernet</i> also named <i>Citizens Net</i> [<a href="#R51">51</a>].

                                       <i>Citizens Net</i> [<a href="#R52">52</a>] is an ICT based COP initiative in Netherlands that is being supported at the national
                                       level. People from the local community voluntarily sign up to participate in <i>Citizens Net</i>. In case of any incident, police can contact the signed-up participants through a
                                       telephone call or SMS to gather information in the specified area where the crime
                                       has occurred. Moreover, there is a <i>Citizens Net</i> website that provides the status of recent cases as well statistics of previously
                                       handled cases. However, the <i>Citizens Net</i> website does not provide interactive communication between police and citizens. Police
                                       can only contact the citizens in case of any incident.

                                    <p id="d1e874">Chicago police have developed a website named CLEARpath for information sharing with
                                       the community [<a href="#R09">9</a>]. CLEARpath emerged as a byproduct of the web tool CLEAR (Citizen and Law Enforcement
                                       Analysis and Reporting System) developed by the Chicago police. CLEAR helps Chicago
                                       police to <i>“police smarter”</i> through finding crime hotspots, networking with other agencies, and extensive mapping
                                       of crime scenes. The CLEAR system was only intended to be used by Chicago police.
                                       Consequently, CLEARpath was developed to provide information access to local communities.
                                       The CLEARpath website is designed to provide a multitude of information to the community,
                                       such as maps of crime scenes, wanted offenders, awareness related to gangs, information
                                       material related to staying safe, preventing crimes, events, and resources. Moreover,
                                       the website also enables the community to report crimes, launch complains about police
                                       behavior, and community concerns. However, a major drawback of CLEARpath is that it
                                       does not include an interactive groupware module where members of community can engage
                                       in discussions to share their views and actively participate in collective problem-solving.
                                       Apart from the CLEARpath, the representatives of Chicago police have regular monthly
                                       or quarterly meetings with community members to share information and concerns.

                                       include ICTs in COP, developing countries, and especially in South Asia are lagging
                                       far behind in this regard. However, there are few initiatives underway in South Asia
                                       to harness ICTs for improving COP efforts. In the subsequent paragraph we will briefly
                                       outline some of these initiatives.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e887">In the recent past, Punjab, Sindh, and KP police departments in Pakistan have started
                                       initiatives to incorporate ICTs, mainly to enhance managerial efficiency and monitoring
                                       activities such as storage, retrieval, processing, and analysis of crime data. For
                                       instance, the KP police launched an initiative to involve the citizens in improving
                                       the efficiency and service of police department. In this initiative, citizens can
                                       launch a First Information Report (FIR) and check the status of their FIR online through
                                       a website [<a href="#R55">55</a>]. Senior administrative police officials can also view the status and inquire about
                                       the FIR from local police stations. There is another system as well wherein citizens
                                       can report the misuse or abuse of powers by any police or government official over
                                       the phone to the provincial government’s designated officials [<a href="#R56">56</a>]. The KP government has also launched a mobile application that allows citizens to
                                       register complaints regarding government service delivery. Citizens can attach a geo-tagged
                                       multimedia content, such as photo, audio, and video to support the complaint and ensure
                                       prompt action [<a href="#R56">56</a>]. CPLC also uses ICTs to store and analyze crime related data, such as vehicle and
                                       mobile theft, target killings, computer sketching, and crime patterns. The police
                                       have solved various cases with the assistance from CPLC using ICTs. Punjab Information
                                       Technology Board (PITB), developed a web and android-based application that enables
                                       police officials and/or witnesses to report a crime [<a href="#R57">57</a>]. The mobile application allows users to report crime related data with photos/videos,
                                       location, date, and type of crime. The recorded information is collected at a central
                                       data warehouse for further processing and record keeping. An important feature of
                                       the application is that it is developed in the national Urdu language for ease of
                                       use and better understanding. The data collected at the data warehouse can be used
                                       to identify crime patterns, hotspots, and offenders in certain areas. Currently the
                                       application is only being used in the provincial capital city of Lahore. More recently,
                                       Lahore city police has established a centralized operations center to enhance interaction
                                       with local citizens. Citizens can interact with police by sending complaints through
                                       SMS or email and the relevant public feedback monitoring desk (PFMD) ensures that
                                       required action is taken against each complaint [<a href="#R58">58</a>].
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e904">Similarly, there have been a few initiatives taken in India to incorporate ICTs to
                                       improve policing and enhance the participation of the local community. For instance,
                                       in the Andhra Pradesh state police department started eCOPS initiative which is a
                                       database for crime reporting and management [<a href="#R59">59</a>]. The eCOPS system was targeted to ease the process of registering an FIR and monitor
                                       the progress of a case by visiting any police station in the vicinity or through the
                                       police website. This helps citizens to easily register FIRs, have less apprehension,
                                       and feel less inhibited by reducing frequent visits to police stations where they
                                       can face strict formalities related to registering an FIR or inquiring about the status
                                       of an existing FIR. The eCOPS database also facilitates police officials from different
                                       jurisdictions in checking the criminal history of suspects online through the Internet,
                                       something which was earlier done manually through personal calls or faxes. A similar
                                       initiative with the name Lokvani was started in Sitapur district of the Uttar Pradesh
                                       state. In this initiative, Lokvani centers, also termed Lokvani kiosks, were established
                                       in various areas of the district where computer and internet connection was provided

                                    <p id="d1e915">In Afghanistan, the first major ICT initiative taken by the Ministry of Interior Afghanistan
                                       (MoIA) was the launching of 119 helpline in 2009 [<a href="#R28">28</a>]. Initial aim of the helpline was to assist citizens in making complaints against
                                       police corruption, misbehavior, and human rights violations. Later the helpline was
                                       also used to report terrorist and criminal activities. The helpline was extended to
                                       five more provinces of Afghanistan in the year 2013, however, majority of the provinces
                                       still do not have the helpline. Moreover, MoIA started to use Twitter and Facebook
                                       for information sharing. Through Facebook and Twitter pages, police can provide information
                                       about their activities and citizens can provide feedback as well as post problems
                                       within a neighborhood.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e920">Nyborg and Nawab identified challenges in the implementation of Afghanistans 119 helpline
                                       [<a href="#R61">61</a>]. One of the key challenges of such a system is to ensure that the received information
                                       is forwarded sufficiently fast to the correct intended office and the identity of
                                       the caller is protected. Eight years after implementation this was still not the case
                                       and represents a serious defect in the system. This is mainly due to the fact that
                                       the system was developed and delivered without considering the local context, without
                                       sufficient testing, and with no provisions for maintenance. The Afghan National Police
                                       themselves lack the expertise and funds to upgrade the system. Protecting caller identity,
                                       controlling access to data, and ensuring that informants or the police do not use
                                       the system to oppress the community are all aspects which need attention before expanding
                                       the system to new provinces. Neglecting these aspects may lead to reduction in communication
                                       and trust between community and police.

                              <p id="d1e928">In many parts of the world, such as Brisbane [<a href="#R62">62</a>], Durban [<a href="#R62">62</a>], Italy [<a href="#R63">63</a>], and Singapore [<a href="#R64">64</a>], it has been found that ICT-based governance leads to more transparency, accountability,
                                 and better communication between local and national government and the community.
                                 ICT-based e-Governance not only ensures the aforementioned essential factors of better
                                 governance, but also provides numerous opportunities for increased civic engagement
                                 of people in important policymaking. Similarly, policing is also considered as an
                                 information intensive job [<a href="#R65">65</a>]. The availability of timely and accurate information can greatly improve performance
                                 of police in the crucial task of crime fighting. With the use of ICTs coupled with
                                 COP, a number of innovative technologies can be explored that will allow both citizens
                                 and police to create, share, and use a multitude of information in the form of text,
                                 audio, and videos. The introduction of ICT-based COP does not necessarily compete
                                 with the existing organization and mission of the police. Rather, ICTs, when applied
                                 wisely with the interests of the public at heart, can rather enhance and improve policing
                                 in general, as well as the work of other participating agencies [<a href="#R09">9</a>, <a href="#R66">66</a>, <a href="#R67">67</a>].

                              <p id="d1e955">The use of ICTs in policing can be broadly classified into two categories: (a) ICTs
                                 that improve operational efficiency and (b) ICTs that contribute to enhancing COP.
                                 For example, ICTs can be leveraged to augment limited police resources for the implementation
                                 of COP in developing countries, as well as enhance problem-solving efforts, improve
                                 community trust and participation, and increase partnership initiatives between police
                                 and community [<a href="#R68">68</a>]. Below we present some specific areas where ICTs can contribute to policing and

                                             Improved inter-agency collaborations can potentially lead to sustained reduction in
                                             crime and increased crime prevention. Moreover, terrorism has become a major concern
                                             all over the world and South Asia is no exception. Particularly in Pakistan, dealing
                                             with terrorism has become the main challenge for government. According to Chermak

                                             analyze, and disseminate intelligence information regarding prospective terrorists
                                             and terrorist attacks. The information can comprise the individuals who want to attack,
                                             what tactics they can use, and their intended targets. Inter-agency cooperation along

                                             this regard, ICT-based initiatives can play a vital role in enabling women to participate
                                             in community policing efforts without being involved in direct contact with police.

                                          <p id="d1e1003">Crimes that are predominantly experienced by women are gender-based violence and sexual
                                             assault. Police are usually the fundamental first link for providing formal justice
                                             in such cases. These cases, however, are usually not reported to the police, and are
                                             thus not recognized or processed through the formal justice system. While there could
                                             be numerous reasons behind women not reporting these cases, one factor is likely the
                                             lack of responsiveness and unequal gender composition of police, as noted in UN Women
                                             Report 2011 [<a href="#R44">44</a>].

                                             throughout the South Asia. For instance, the average percentage of women in police
                                             is 2% in Pakistan with Gilgit Baltistan region having highest representation of policewomen
                                             at 3.4% [<a href="#R73">73</a>]. India has around 6% representation of policewomen on average in the Indian police
                                             force with highest representation of women in Chandigarh with 14.6% [<a href="#R74">74</a>]. Nepal police had approximately 7% women in the police force in 2015 [<a href="#R75">75</a>], that is expected to increase to 10% by 2018 [<a href="#R76">76</a>]. Similarly, Bangladesh has around 6% women in the police force [<a href="#R77">77</a>], which was less than 1% in 1988 [<a href="#R78">78</a>]. It must be noted that even in most developed countries, representation of women
                                             in police remains less than or equal to one quarter and even significantly less in
                                             higher ranks. Moreover, women belonging to ethnic or racial minorities have very poor
                                             representation in police [<a href="#R44">44</a>].

                                             and aim to increase women’s representation in the police, this has not been practically
                                             realized. The few initiatives taken by Ministry of Interior, Afghanistan (MoIA) have

                                             of women in police. They include [<a href="#R79">79</a>]: (a) 120-bed female residence built by Germany at police academy, (b) a gender adviser
                                             for MoI funded by Canada, (c) in-service training to police women delivered by Norwegian
                                             police, (d) a family violence unit established at a police station in Kabul with the
                                             support of US and UN that provides experience to police women in assisting female
                                             victims. Apart from lack of political will and ill-planned recruitment policies of
                                             the government, major reasons behind lower intake of women in police are cultural
                                             barriers. In general, the police are not considered a respectable occupation for women.
                                             Moreover, issues related to mobility and security of women add to the difficulty of
                                             recruiting and retaining women in police. Similarly, there is growing concern to address
                                             the gender disparity in Pakistan police services. Some of the initiatives taken to
                                             address the gender responsiveness in Pakistan police include: (a) establishment of

                                             [<a href="#R80">80</a>]. Some of the factors that influence gender-responsive policing in South Asia include
                                             gender disparities, religious and sociocultural factors, and availability of resources.
                                             These factors play key role both in the implementation of such initiatives and how
                                             they are received by different stakeholders.

                                             to technology as men. For instance, men in Pakistan are twice as likely to have a
                                             cell phone compared to women [<a href="#R81">81</a>]. In South Asian countries where women are not provided equal space in the public

                                             each other, government services, as well as explore new avenues for self-expression.
                                             For instance, in post-conflict Afghanistan, where women may not be permitted to go
                                             outside their houses, ICTs such as mobile phones and the Internet could provide access

                                             society. Moreover, ICTs have the potential to improve women’s safety and security

                                          <p id="d1e1051">Violence against women is an alarming problem throughout the South Asia. Women are
                                             the victims of sexual harassment, rape, and honor killing just to name a few. Women
                                             as victim are at risk for further victimization under police custody. While many incidences
                                             of sexual and physical violence including rape have been reported under custody of
                                             law enforcement departments, it is likely that the majority of such cases are not
                                             even reported owing to fear of reprisal [<a href="#R82">82</a>]. Therefore, it is important to ensure basic human rights for women and strengthen
                                             their access to law and justice system. The foremost thing to achieve this goal, is
                                             to increase awareness about national and regional violence against women laws. The
                                             more people (both men and women) know about the laws and supporting legal framework,
                                             the more they can claim their rights and support legal mechanisms. To this end, various
                                             ICTs initiatives and radio and TV programs can be leveraged to enhance community awareness
                                             regarding violence against women laws and the legal options available to the victims
                                             including government or NGO-supported shelter homes. National and provincial governments
                                             in Pakistan have started different initiatives to assist women victims of violence.
                                             For instance, at national level a toll-free helpline 1099 has been established to
                                             report human rights violations including violence against women [<a href="#R83">83</a>]. Similarly, Punjab government established helpline 1043, which is supported by Punjab
                                             Commission on the Status of Women. Further, the Violence Against Women Center has
                                             been established in Multan City of Punjab to provide shelter and protection to women
                                             . Similarly, a special court is constituted at the Lahore judicial complex to deal

                                          <p id="d1e1065">To create a truly inclusive society, participation of minorities in all areas of society
                                             is indispensable. ICT-based community policing has the potential to give voice to
                                             minorities, and lower the communication barriers between different ethnic, racial,
                                             and religious communities thereby improving community safety and security. ICTs alone,
                                             however, are not sufficient to address the complexities of minority exclusion; they
                                             need to be combined with a number of non-technical activities to ensure their relevance.
                                             Police forces are often composed of persons belonging to dominant segments of the
                                             community. In particular, women belonging to minorities have very limited representation
                                             in the police. Homogeneous composition of police force can lead to biased behavior
                                             towards certain minority groups, which in turn can lead to confrontational rather
                                             than cooperative behavior between the police and these communities. Poor relationships
                                             between minority communities and police have a profound impact on support for legal
                                             authorities and crime control [<a href="#R85">85</a>]. Experiences show that inclusion of minorities can potentially increase efficiency
                                             of police force significantly, particularly when dealing with different ethnic and
                                             racial groups [<a href="#R86">86</a>].

                                          <p id="d1e1073">The religious and cultural context must also be considered while defining measures
                                             for improving participation of minorities in political, cultural, and social activities.
                                             To build trust and improve relationships with minority communities, it is important
                                             for police to reach out to minorities. In this regard, regular meetings and discussions
                                             can be organized between police and minority community members to build trust and
                                             facilitate the communication of issues and complaints. Feedback should be provided
                                             in terms of actions taken against complaints and justifications where complaints are

                                          <p id="d1e1075">The strategy for inclusion of minorities in police should be part of an overall government
                                             policy to empower minorities. An isolated strategy towards minorities is likely to
                                             be ineffective due to conflicting or inconsistent policies in other minority-related
                                             areas. To ensure equal access to police services and design comprehensive and coherent
                                             policies for minorities, meaningful consultation must be carried out to address their
                                             requirements considering specific minority context. Inclusion of police personnel
                                             recruited from the same minority group has positive impact on police-community relationship
                                             because they are more trusted by minorities compared to regular police officials [<a href="#R86">86</a>, <a href="#R87">87</a>]. Moreover, increasing representation of minority women, speaking same language,
                                             is paramount and can positively affect the relationship with minority communities.
                                             Demographic factors, such as gender, age, education, and race of police officials
                                             affect support for community policing [<a href="#R85">85</a>]. Community policing strategy may prove to be effective in building and restoring
                                             good relationship between minority communities and police. This can be achieved when
                                             law enforcement agencies take care and respect cultural values and priorities [<a href="#R85">85</a>, <a href="#R88">88</a>]. Studies show that positive attitude of police personnel towards community oriented
                                             policing is correlated with positive attitude towards minorities [<a href="#R87">87</a>, <a href="#R89">89</a>].

                                             The basic philosophy of COP encourages the development of bi-directional communication
                                             and constant dialog between police and community. ICTs can help to achieve these goals
                                             through online interactive applications, such as web portals, email and mobile alerts,
                                             microblogs, and social networks. For instance, after the explosion of bombs at the
                                             Boston Marathon, Boston police department used Twitter (a micro-blogging service)
                                             to inform the public about investigations, request assistance, correct wrong information
                                             propagated through press, and calm the nerves and stay restraint [<a href="#R90">90</a>]. Afterwards, state and federal investigation agencies decided to <i>‘crowdsource’</i> and ask the public for help to forward any media (e.g., videos and photos) or leads
                                             related to bomb attacks. Within few hours, thousands of photos, videos, and textual
                                             data was received that led to successful identification and arrest of the two lead
                                             suspects [<a href="#R91">91</a>].

                                          <p id="d1e1119">In COP, there must be continuous communication between the local community and the
                                             police department. The community should be consulted and fully involved in making
                                             important policy decisions. This will lead to greater transparency in decision-making.
                                             Moreover, in certain instances, the use of ICTs can enhance community confidence as
                                             well as success of COP efforts. Three large police departments in North America, Washington
                                             DC, Boston, and Toronto have used ICTs to improve police-community relationships and
                                             strengthen COP efforts [<a href="#R68">68</a>]. For instance, Toronto Police Service (TPS) uses a networking strategy to ‘humanize
                                             the police’ and ‘narrowcasting’. TPS uses Twitter and Facebook to build networks between
                                             citizens and police officials. TPS social media strategy supports bidirectional communication
                                             between police and citizens where both can share information and multimedia content.
                                             Similarly, Metropolitan Police Department in Washington, DC uses Facebook, Twitter,
                                             and YouTube for supporting specific tasks depending upon the case requirements to
                                             provide as well as receive information to and from citizens [<a href="#R68">68</a>].

                                          <p id="d1e1130">Various innovative ICTs can be used to support COP. For instance, mobile technology
                                             can be used to provide required information to police officers on patrol that will
                                             enable them to engage more effectively with the local communities [<a href="#R92">92</a>]. Moreover, this will enable police officers to be more proactive in street patrolling
                                             by concentrating on certain problem areas identified through community feedback. Similarly,
                                             social media can provide a novel communication platform to engage with citizens, share
                                             information, and address the issues that are relevant to certain localized communities.
                                             For instance, Greater Manchester police has been using Twitter to engage local communities
                                             and exchange various types of information, such as reports about criminal activities,
                                             information requests, and type of actions taken by police officers in a certain situation
                                             [<a href="#R93">93</a>]. Latest developments in crowd sourcing and social networking applications can be
                                             effectively utilized to enhance COP efforts [<a href="#R68">68</a>, <a href="#R90">90</a>, <a href="#R91">91</a>].

                                          <p id="d1e1147">Technologies and applications that support community policing increasingly rely on
                                             cell phones that have become ubiquitous in our daily lives. There have been initiatives
                                             in different South Asian counties that exploit cell phones to promote community policing.
                                             However, it is important to analyze the level of cell phone penetration in the given
                                             area before considering deployment of mobile phone-based applications. Table <a href="#Tab4">4</a> provides an overview of current mobile phone penetration in different regions of
                                             South Asia.
                                          </p>
                                          <p id="d1e1152">The Table <a href="#Tab4">4</a> clearly shows that cell phone penetration is more than two thirds of the population
                                             in all South Asian countries, with the proportion of mobile internet users comparatively
                                             lower. Currently, most mobile internet users belong to the densely populated urban
                                             areas, since rural areas lack high-quality mobile internet coverage. However, the
                                             number of mobile internet (3G/4G) users is expected to increase significantly in the
                                             next few years. For instance, 3G and 4G coverage in Pakistan is expected to reach
                                             90% and 80% by 2020, respectively [<a href="#R94">94</a>]. Similarly, LTE (4G) coverage in India is expected to reach around 84% by 2019 [<a href="#R95">95</a>]. Mobile broadband has the potential to reduce the digital divide between urban and
                                             rural areas. With the rapidly growing penetration of mobile internet (3G/4G), internet
                                             access disparity between urban and rural areas is anticipated to diminish.

                                    <p id="d1e1166">There are certain factors, such as institutional capacity, resource availability,
                                       and institutional willingness that determine how well ICTs respond and contribute
                                       towards achieving the desired goals of COP. A significant proportion of policing procedures
                                       entails the data processing and efficient communication and dissemination of relevant
                                       information. ICTs can improve these procedures through improved data management and
                                       efficient communication systems. In a region like South Asia, where resources are
                                       limited, efficient utilization and better management of available resources becomes
                                       even more crucial. This fact is also acknowledged by many donor agencies, such as
                                       World Bank, UNDP, and UNESCO that view ICTs as a means to achieve more transparency
                                       and better data management that will contribute to better service provision [<a href="#R62">62</a>, <a href="#R96">96</a>]. Some of the factors that contribute towards the successful implementation of ICT
                                       based COP are depicted in Figure <a href="#Fig2">2</a>.

                                    <p id="d1e1177">There have been many initiatives to inculcate COP in almost all the countries of South
                                       Asia, and some of them have proved more successful than others. COP in South Asia,
                                       however, has not in general been adopted as an organizational philosophy in police
                                       strategies. There can be multitude of factors behind the failure to adopt COP in police
                                       ethos. Some of the most prominent factors that affect widespread implementation of
                                       COP in South Asia are: <b>(a)</b> deficiency of trust between the community and police, <b>(b)</b> lack of conceptual clarity on the subject by police personnel, <b>(c)</b> strong resistance to change in current police culture, and <b>(d)</b> absence of long-term sincere commitment by the police department and government [<a href="#R31">31</a>]. Implementation of COP is a long-term process that requires consistent police-community
                                       collaboration and partnership. Therefore, it is imperative to establish sustainable
                                       trust between police and community. There are number of factors behind the trust deficit
                                       among citizens, such as high rate of corruption, brutality towards citizens, lack
                                       of internal accountability, lack of political will and absence of oversight mechanisms
                                       [<a href="#R31">31</a>]. The aforementioned factors need to be considered for sustainable implementation
                                       and adoption of COP in South Asia and ICTs can certainly help to overcome the challenges
                                       faced by COP.

                              <p id="d1e1366">Although there are a number of exciting opportunities for the use of ICTs in COP,
                                 there are also immense challenges in implementing ICT-based COP in South Asia. We
                                 have organized some of these challenges into three broad categories i.e. institutional,
                                 social and technical (see Figure <a href="#Fig3">3</a>). In the subsequent sections we briefly discuss how these challenges need to be addressed
                                 for effective implementation of ICT based COP in South Asia. Majority of the challenges
                                 presented in this Section are authors’ own assessment based on scientific literature
                                 review. Moreover, some of the challenges were identified during our field surveys
                                 that include interviews of community representatives and focus group discussions conducted
                                 at the KP province, Pakistan. However, the list of challenges included here should
                                 not be considered exhaustive.

                                    <p id="d1e1381"><b>a) Resource availability:</b> The cost of resources plays a vital role in adopting any new technology. To implement
                                       ICT-based COP in initiatives (such as call numbers), a centralized system is needed
                                       to manage the required data. Such a system should also provide the necessary computing
                                       facilities required to store, retrieve, and process large amounts of data. To fulfill
                                       such huge storage and computational requirements, data centers could be established
                                       in different regions of the country. Regional data centers could provide services
                                       to multiple police forces of the region. Moreover, the regional data centers could
                                       be connected through high speed networks to create a large interconnected data center.
                                       To establish the data centers at regional and national level, financial support from
                                       national and local governments as well as international donor agencies could be sought.
                                       
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e1385"><b> b) Institutional capacity: </b>
                                       In addition to technical resources, well-trained and motivated human capital is equally
                                       important for successful implementation of ICT-based COP. Even if a government provides
                                       the required computational resources, if the police staff is not trained to effectively
                                       and correctly use the resources then they will be wasted. Currently, most of the staff
                                       hired in police departments are not very well trained in using ICT tools. To address
                                       this issue, a two-pronged strategy could be adopted: (1) to hire new staff that are
                                       already trained in using ICTs; and (2) provide on-the-job training to existing staff
                                       that are motivated to learn how to use ICT tools for implementing COP. Likewise, there
                                       is often a lack of understanding of COP policy and practice – compounded by the fact
                                       that there is no single global definition of COP. This is partly due to the fact that
                                       social, cultural, and political values and contexts vary greatly, both nationally
                                       and regionally. Therefore, it is important for the police personnel to comprehensively
                                       understand what COP entails, and how to develop an approach to working with communities
                                       that is relevant for their context. In this regard, proper education and on-the-job
                                       training in how to understand and implement COP is important. Moreover, seminars and
                                       workshops should be arranged for the awareness of community. The awareness programs
                                       should include what are the benefits and goals of COP might be, and what is in turn
                                       expected from both the police and the local community to make the initiatives a success.
                                       It has been observed in many case studies that either police or community or even
                                       both may not fully understand the concept of COP and therefore are unable to carry
                                       out the required tasks []. It is in fact only when both the police and communities
                                       understand the concept and practice of COP, that ICT tools can be used to support
                                       their activities.

                                    <p id="d1e1389"><b>c) Institutional and political willingness:</b>
                                       One of the most important factors that determines the success or failure of ICT-based
                                       COP is institutional willingness, especially from higher police management. A strong
                                       motivation and commitment from government and higher police administration is vital
                                       for success of ICT based COP initiatives.

                                    <p id="d1e1393"><b>d) Sustainable support:</b> Implementation of COP together with the adoption of ICTs will be a slow process.
                                       It has been observed in many case studies that visible progress on such initiatives
                                       can take up to several years [<a href="#R109">109</a>]. Therefore, strong sustainable support from higher police administration and political
                                       government is highly desirable [<a href="#R110">110</a>].
                                       
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e1403"><b>e) Ethical considerations:</b> Use of information technology in policing is expected to accumulate large volume
                                       of data pertaining to crime and criminals [<a href="#R111">111</a>]. Moreover, use of ICTs in COP could as well generate contents in various forms,
                                       such as text, photos, and videos [<a href="#R90">90</a>,<a href="#R102">102</a>]. However, care must be taken to ensure anonymization of data to ensure protection
                                       of community members participating. Similarly, it is equally important to make sure
                                       that the data/information is not misused by any entity, neither police nor criminals.
                                       For instance, social networks generated through ICTs may be misinterpreted and can
                                       potentially lead to false inferences [<a href="#R113">113</a>].

                                    <p id="d1e1419"><b>f) Additional efforts:</b> Use of ICTs introduce complexities and additional demands compared to traditional
                                       police operations that may undermine the potential of ICTs to be successful. On the
                                       one hand, new ICT tools provide police greater access to information, on the other
                                       hand these tools often require extensive reporting from police in the field. The need
                                       for more reporting may negate the expected efficiency and can lead to lesser interaction
                                       with the community and engagement in proactive police work as well as create frustration

                                    <p id="d1e1429"><b>a) Local context: </b>It is important to consider the social and cultural values of local communities while
                                       developing COP. Otherwise, the local COP efforts are likely to fail. In the case of
                                       Hong Kong, Lau (2004) found that initial COP efforts failed mainly because an alien
                                       model, imported from America and Britain, was transplanted there without due consideration
                                       given to the local context. Lack of consideration of the socially and economically
                                       diverse population was a key reason for the meager achievement of local COP in Hong
                                       Kong. Ideally, national police institutions would, rather than implementing external
                                       models of COP, engage civil society in the development of locally appropriate COP
                                       approaches, which would, per definition, include activities such as community engagement,
                                       dialog and joint problem solving which would incorporate local contexts in the process.
                                       
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e1433"><b>b) Lack of coordination: </b>There are different departments that come under the police, and different government
                                       ministries and agencies that are relevant to include in COP activities. How much and
                                       to what extent they coordinate and share data with each other is another challenge.
                                       To overcome this obstacle, a central authority could exist that would be able to integrate
                                       and coordinate COP efforts among various police and other government departments.
                                       There are examples of this, such as Brisbane’s smart city project, that show that
                                       coordinated efforts are required. Moreover, there can be many opportunities for creative
                                       public, private, and social sector partnerships. A major drawback of having fragmented
                                       ICT-based COP efforts in different regions from various communities of society is

                                       duplication. To achieve concerted efforts from various stakeholders, such as government
                                       agencies, community, and private sector strong networking among stakeholders is required.

                                       has been a challenging problem. In cultures where a uniformed police officer is a
                                       symbol of fear rather than safety, establishing trust between community and police
                                       is even more difficult. However, ICTs could aid in achieving the trust where there
                                       is very little direct face-to-face interaction possible among the involved parties.
                                       Efforts to build online relationships with the citizens can provide basis for improving
                                       offline police-community interactions. Similarly, the actions taken by police management
                                       against complaints registered through ICT tools could be instrumental in building
                                       trust and gaining respect in community. In this regard, a transparent mechanism for
                                       citizens to track the complaints and follow up their cases would require an easy-to-operate

                                       and equipment required to access the Internet. More developed areas such as urban
                                       centers may have sufficient technology available to access the high-speed broadband
                                       internet access. Many large and medium cities are as well covered by third generation
                                       (3G) cellular services. However, the less developed, rural areas may not have access
                                       to the same level of ICT infrastructure. Furthermore, the affordability of computing
                                       devices to participate in ICT-based community interaction is another critical issue
                                       for less developed areas of the region. This provides interesting opportunities for
                                       public/private partnership to provide computers and cell phones at low prices to people

                                       areas [<a href="#R117">117</a>]. As we saw above, rural populations have limited access to ICT resources, such as
                                       computers, Internet, and cell phones. Therefore, it is critical to provide ICT access
                                       to rural populations for their inclusion and active participation in COP related activities.
                                       Various initiatives have been taken in the past to provide ICTs to rural populations
                                       in South Asia. For instance, “Public Access Internet Kiosks” have been established
                                       in remote villages of different states of India including Tamil Nadu and Madhya Pradesh.
                                       These kiosks are equipped with computers and Internet connection and are operated
                                       by local individuals having working knowledge of computers [<a href="#R118">118</a>]. Another initiative was taken in villages of two Indian states to introduce ICT
                                       ecosystem for the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA)
                                       Project. The MGNREGA initiative includes information kiosks, internet connectivity,
                                       mobile phone service, and community radio to raise awareness among rural women. A
                                       salient feature of MGNREGA is that it ensures active and compulsory participation
                                       of rural women because 33% of jobs at any given worksite are reserved for women [<a href="#R119">119</a>]. In conflict and post-conflict societies, women do not have equal access to technology.
                                       This divide is even more evident in rural population. Therefore, there is need to
                                       introduce similar initiatives in other countries of the region with certain modifications,

                                       between human and environment security is somewhat complex. Human security is linked
                                       with the availability of natural resources and is greatly affected by environmental
                                       vulnerabilities. On the other hand, environmental change is both directly and indirectly
                                       affected by conflicts and human activities [<a href="#R120">120</a>]. In particular, climate change is contributing to unprecedented natural disasters

                                       impact human livelihoods and quality of life [<a href="#R121">121</a>], and ICTs have a potential role to play in responding to these to contribute to
                                       human security. However, there are several studies that also investigate possible
                                       negative effects of ICTs [<a href="#R122">122</a>]. Throughout its lifetime, ICT hardware can affect human health and environment.

                                       and green house gas (GHG) emissions. Moreover, disposing and recycling of ICT hardware
                                       as e-waste in landfills or disassembling at the end of its lifecycle have negative
                                       impact on the environment [<a href="#R123">123</a>]. In contrast to general municipal waste, certain components found in electronic

                              <p id="d1e1520">Successful implementation of ICT-based COP in South Asia can effectively enhance police-community
                                 relations and citizen participation in policing. This can lead to trust-building,
                                 and improved police efficiency in reducing crime, fear of crime, and terrorism. However,
                                 it is not easy to introduce ICTs in COP especially for developing regions such as
                                 South Asia. In this article, we have reviewed the current state-of-the-art related
                                 to implementation of ICTs for use in COP in developed countries and what lessons can
                                 be learned by developing countries from such projects, highlighting some of the significant
                                 challenges for implementation of ICT-based COP. Although there are certain initiatives
                                 being undertaken in some countries of South Asia, there is still a long way to go.
                                 Nevertheless, it is recommended to gradually integrate ICTs in COP initiatives in
                                 order to ensure they are appropriate and accepted. In this regard, readily available
                                 technologies, such as computers, internet, and mobile phones can be used to develop
                                 user-friendly systems keeping in view the local context. Embracing ICTs for COP can
                                 give rise to many interesting opportunities, such as use of social networks, inclusion
                                 of women, and inter-agency cooperation to achieve the desired goals.

                              <p id="d1e1522">Although ICTs hold great potential for improving policing practices, care must be
                                 taken while selecting or developing such technologies. Questions must be raised as
                                 to what extent these technologies can improve human security by analyzing the impact
                                 of these technologies on police efficiency as well as privacy and well-being of citizens.
                                 Adoption of ICTs alone do not always lead to obvious and easy enhancements in police
                                 productivity, management, communication, and building of trust with communities; they
                                 need to be combined with people-focused COP approaches which can address the complexities
                                 and diversity of local contexts. More research is required in each case to analyze
                                 which organizational strategies including implementation, management, training, and
                                 evaluation are critical to achieve desired objectives with ICTs and at the same time
                                 avoid negative, unintended consequences. In fact, new ways of evaluating ICT use in
                                 COP need to be developed based on local criteria together with civil society to be
                                 sure that a set of common objectives emerges. Typically, ICTs should only be used
                                 where they enhance human security—care must be taken to ensure that they do not allow
                                 for the targeting of vulnerable populations.
