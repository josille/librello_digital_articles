                                 from a prehospital emergency medical services (EMS) perspective. The aim of this review
                                 was to 1) categorize preconditions for emergency response in tunnel environments based
                                 on Haddon’s matrix and 2) identify specific EMS knowledge of providing prehospital
                                 care. Twenty eight articles, reports and book chapters were selected for further analysis.
                                 Firstly, sorting the data from each included article was done according to Haddon’s
                                 matrix. The result covers human factors, technical factors, physical environmental
                                 factors and socioeconomic environmental factors all related to preconditions for emergency
                                 response. To describe the EMS’s knowledge the data was also sorted according to command
                                 and safety, communication, assessment, and triage treatment and transport, also known
                                 as CSCATT. Few studies, especially of high quality, actually provide detailed information
                                 regarding emergency response to tunnel incidents and those that do, often have a main
                                 focus on management by the rescue service. While many incidents studied were caused
                                 by fires in tunnels, thus requiring rescue service in action, the subsequent EMS response
                                 issues that have taken place appear to have been given limited attention. To optimize
                                 the survival rates and health of the injured, as well as to provide a safe and effective
                                 work environment for the emergency services, there is a need to explore the event
                                 phase.</span></div>

                              <p id="d1e115">Mass casualty incidents (MCIs) remain an extraordinary challenge for prehospital response.
                                 A number of studies of MCIs have highlighted the need for further general knowledge
                                 in the areas of initial treatment and transport of patients [<a href="#R1">1</a>], communication [<a href="#R2">2</a>, <a href="#R3">3</a>], joint training of emergency services [<a href="#R4">4</a>], and call for more systematic reporting and research on possible associations between
                                 actions and outcomes to improve the emergency response [<a href="#R5">5</a>]. The ramifications of incidents in difficult and confined environments, such as
                                 tunnels or other underground sites adds further challenges for emergency response
                                 and the outcomes can be devastating, as seen in the Baku Metro fire (289 people killed)
                                 [<a href="#R6">6</a>] and the Daegu underground railway station fire (198 people killed) [<a href="#R7">7</a>]. Other types of incidents are tunnel collapses, e.g. at a nuclear test site in North
                                 Korea (about 200 people killed) [<a href="#R8">8</a>], which in turn, led to concerns about radiation and safety for personnel as half
                                 of the deaths occurred during prehospital response.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e142">Increasing traffic frequencies, driving speeds, number of hazardous goods transports,
                                 and higher loading capacities constitute some risk factors for increased numbers of
                                 tunnel incidents [<a href="#R7">7</a>, <a href="#R9">9</a>]. While the probability of an incident in a tunnel can be considered comparatively
                                 low to on open roads [<a href="#R9">9</a>, <a href="#R10">10</a>], the consequences are more extensive, measured in percentage of injured and killed
                                 [<a href="#R10">10</a>, <a href="#R11">11</a>, <a href="#R12">12</a>]. Should a fire ensue, self-rescue will most likely determine chances of survival,
                                 given the speed with which a fire develops. However, some of the tunnel users may
                                 require assisted evacuation by emergency services i.e. rescue services (RS) and emergency
                                 medical services (EMS) [<a href="#R10">10</a>]. Meanwhile emergency response to tunnel incidents may be impaired, because of limited
                                 access routes and possible traffic jams [<a href="#R10">10</a>, <a href="#R11">11</a>, <a href="#R12">12</a>] as well as conditions in the tunnel, for instance impaired vision and extreme heat
                                 exposure in the case of a fire [<a href="#R13">13</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e182">With regard to tunnel fires, stakeholders often have an overly optimistic view of
                                 the risk of an incident and its severity, combined with unrealistic expectations of
                                 emergency response and underestimation of the potential for loss of life [<a href="#R14">14</a>]. Most of the existing literature on how to reduce the consequences of an incident
                                 investigate aspects such as smoke, ventilation, fire dynamics, construction, and risk
                                 assessment [<a href="#R15">15</a>]. In the rare cases where the rescuers’ perspectives regarding tunnel incidents have
                                 been studied, they focus on the RS [<a href="#R14">14</a>, <a href="#R15">15</a>, <a href="#R16">16</a>] not the EMS response. The practical problem is thus that the tunnel environment
                                 directly increases the injurious effects of incidents while the EMS possibilities
                                 to respond and save life are inhibited. The scientific problem is that research has
                                 focused on primary prevention of technical issues related to fire or other emergencies
                                 and aiding self-rescue, but studies on EMS response to tunnel incidents are scarce.

                                 (Table <a href="#Tab1">1</a>). Slightly different keywords and clusters were used in the databases, as MeSH terms
                                 could not be used in Academic Search Elite. Tested words/terms did not add any records
                                 or generated only irrelevant records (Table <a href="#Tab2">2</a>).

                                 secondly, the chosen abstracts and then the full texts were examined to confirm that
                                 they did not meet the exclusion criteria. To determine inclusion or exclusion of articles,

                                       searches (Figure <a href="#Fig1">1</a>). Many studies were excluded as they focused on questions of engineering aspects

                                       28 scientific articles, reports and book chapters were deemed relevant and of scientific
                                       quality to merit inclusion. According to the evidence hierarchy used in the study
                                       (c.f. [<a href="#R19">19</a>]) none of the included literature were systematic reviews or cross-sectional studies,

                                       response in tunnel environments, the matrix of Haddon Jr. regarding injury prevention
                                       [<a href="#R20">20</a>] was used. The data was applied to the matrix as a method for providing structure
                                       and to understand the content of the included articles. In the Haddon matrix, injury
                                       mechanisms (harmful energy) and their injury vector (energy carrier) [<a href="#R21">21</a>] are sequentially separated over time versus their contributing factors, i.e. human,
                                       technical, and environmental. Environmental aspects may be further separated into
                                       physical and socioeconomic factors. In this study, the Haddon matrix was used in an
                                       adapted fashion as it is typically applied to a specific incident, not to compile
                                       a summary of factors found in studies containing many types of incidents. Additionally,
                                       some incident types (e.g., fires) are quite difficult to summarize in such a matrix
                                       as the incident is dynamic; the duration of “the event” is longer. This complicates
                                       determination of what constitutes an event as opposed to a post-event factor. Lastly,
                                       the actions of different actors (e.g. tunnel users, rescue personnel) are included

                                          <p id="d1e364">In a tunnel fire the heat and smoke quickly create a fatal environment [<a href="#R23">23</a>]. A tunnel fire test has shown that the level of smoke rises very rapidly and that
                                             an area can become completely engulfed in smoke in 5 minutes. Thus, it is crucial
                                             that the tunnel users swiftly evacuate and that emergency services reach the area
                                             quickly [<a href="#R24">24</a>]. Meanwhile several studies have shown that people tend to stay in their vehicles
                                             [<a href="#R24">24</a>, <a href="#R25">25</a>, <a href="#R26">26</a>] as they often do not recognize the seriousness of a fire and worry about their possessions
                                             [<a href="#R24">24</a>]. This means that people are more willing to stay in the well-known and “safe” environment
                                             than to leave the car to evacuate [<a href="#R27">27</a>]. Examples of this kind of delayed evacuation have been seen in several mass casualty
                                             tunnel fires, such as in the Mont Blanc tunnel [<a href="#R27">27</a>]. Encouraging people to find and use emergency exits, if available, is reported as
                                             an issue as many instead evacuate towards the tunnel portals, as these are a familiar
                                             way out [<a href="#R27">27</a>]. Through fire drills in tunnels or first-aider training the public can gain local
                                             knowledge and useful skills which makes them more inclined to find their way out of
                                             the tunnel and/or help others [<a href="#R28">28</a>]. Knowledge of previous incidents can also be vital [<a href="#R29">29</a>].

                                             if the emergency response is to be achieved quickly [<a href="#R30">30</a>]. This includes technical factors seen in installations in the tunnel and equipment
                                             for the public and the emergency services. To enable evacuation, emergency exits (less
                                             than 300 m apart), signage and auditory systems must be purposefully designed [<a href="#R24">24</a>, <a href="#R25">25</a>, <a href="#R26">26</a>]. Additional aspects to enable emergency response include blast resistant lightings,
                                             high setting emergency lighting and signage visible through smoke [<a href="#R24">24</a>, <a href="#R26">26</a>], as increased visibility eases rescue operations. Access to first aid equipment
                                             and portable fire extinguishers may also be helpful [<a href="#R30">30</a>].

                                          <p id="d1e427">Communication issues during the response are well-known and common in mass casualty
                                             incidents due to overload of mobile network, and presents an even greater challenge
                                             in the tunnel environment where mobiles and radios are often non-functional [<a href="#R28">28</a>, <a href="#R30">30</a>, <a href="#R31">31</a>, <a href="#R32">32</a>, <a href="#R33">33</a>, <a href="#R34">34</a>, <a href="#R35">35</a>, <a href="#R36">36</a>]. An installed radio communication system can facilitate communication between different
                                             services [<a href="#R23">23</a>]. Personal mobiles and available mobile network infrastructure can allow data sharing
                                             and dissemination of information in and across organizations [<a href="#R37">37</a>]. Another important issue for the EMS response is a functional fire detection system,
                                             heat sensors and monitoring and surveillance equipment [<a href="#R23">23</a>, <a href="#R26">26</a>], to identify the precise location of the fire [<a href="#R29">29</a>]. A fire detection system being out of service and lack of knowledge of fire location
                                             can delay emergency response [<a href="#R25">25</a>, <a href="#R29">29</a>]. While some tunnels have 24-hour monitoring system, fire-fighting facilities, fire
                                             trucks and dedicated response teams, others are dependent on aid by emergency services

                                             extended duration breathing apparatus, personal protective equipment (PPE), head lamps
                                             and extra oxygen for casualties [<a href="#R30">30</a>, <a href="#R32">32</a>, <a href="#R34">34</a>, <a href="#R38">38</a>].

                                          <p id="d1e495">In confined spaces such as subway architecture, fire gas might disperse less rapidly
                                             than it does in an open space [<a href="#R39">39</a>]. Fire ventilation can enable responders to better fight the fire [<a href="#R23">23</a>] and enable a quick emergency response. In a twin tube tunnel fire, the smoke will
                                             probably be vented and fire extinguishing can begin in a smoke-free environment. However,
                                             the same fire in a single-tube tunnel can cause major difficulties in terms of extinguishing
                                             the fire depending on whether the smoke can be vented. Without the possibility of
                                             fire ventilation, the fire may require an advanced smoke diving operation before the
                                             fire extinguishing can begin [<a href="#R27">27</a>]. This, in turn, delays the response and worsens the situation leading to several
                                             deaths and injuries [<a href="#R26">26</a>]. One conclusion, in terms of response to large tunnel fires, is that focus should
                                             be on providing ventilation. The duration of exposure to smoke is very important for
                                             the outcome [<a href="#R31">31</a>]. Natural ventilation may also play a role as shown by an incident where four people
                                             who were exposed to smoke for one hour survived due to beneficial winds, which allowed
                                             for some breathable air [<a href="#R26">26</a>, <a href="#R40">40</a>]. The wind can also have detrimental effects [<a href="#R23">23</a>].

                                             goods, infrastructure, and responders [<a href="#R41">41</a>]. Tunnel design aspects, such as its length, number of tubes, bi or uni-directional
                                             traffic flow, provision of a service tunnel and fresh air ducts, have implications
                                             for emergency response [<a href="#R30">30</a>]. Moreover, escape galleries or lighted air-locked corridors allow for users to evacuate
                                             the tunnel and may also provide storage for smaller evacuation vehicles. Train tunnels
                                             emergency stations may provide passengers the opportunity to access an evacuation
                                             tunnel or communication branches may allow passengers to evacuate through a train
                                             on the opposite side. Refuges, allocated evenly along the tunnel, are made to protect
                                             tunnel users from the direct atmosphere of the tunnel by ventilation through fresh
                                             air ducts and a light under-pressure which imposes an air flux [<a href="#R23">23</a>]. It is vital that emergency call niches are not confused with escape galleries or
                                             refuges [<a href="#R29">29</a>]. What might happen when risks are underestimated and emergencies not considered
                                             during construction, are e.g. that tunnels may not have emergency routes nor lighting,
                                             no means of communication or to open the doors for the passengers [<a href="#R33">33</a>].

                                             and built a long time ago, and for other types of vehicles and less traffic, impact
                                             the emergency response. For example, the deep tube lines in London are designed with
                                             only a 15 cm clearance around the carriages and the tunnel sides, which severely impacted
                                             access and evacuation in the London bombing [<a href="#R42">42</a>]. Moreover, confined spaces such as subway trains, buses and tunnels exacerbate effects
                                             of bomb detonations since surface reflections amplify and prolong the blast wave.
                                             In turn, the blast wind is channeled, and heat and gases are contained [<a href="#R35">35</a>, <a href="#R42">42</a>]. Thus, the severity of injuries among survivors and mortality is greater in confined
                                             space bombings compared to explosions in open-air environments [<a href="#R32">32</a>, <a href="#R43">43</a>].

                                          <p id="d1e627">Scene safety is pointed out as a huge concern in tunnel incident scenarios [<a href="#R25">25</a>, <a href="#R32">32</a>, <a href="#R42">42</a>]. Scene safety assessment includes different types of issues: 1) Environmental (e.g.
                                             confined space, heat, hazardous materials, collapse); 2) Biological (e.g. sharps and
                                             debris, positive infective risks); 3) Chemical (e.g. smoke, combustion products, particulate
                                             matter), and 4) Electrical (in the event of incident in train/subway tunnel). Furthermore,
                                             there may be intentional dangers, if the incident had an antagonistic cause [<a href="#R25">25</a>, <a href="#R26">26</a>, <a href="#R32">32</a>, <a href="#R42">42</a>]. In addition to these direct threats for EMS responders and victims there may be
                                             indirect threats in tunnel environments that result in danger depending on subsequent
                                             events [<a href="#R25">25</a>]. Challenging working conditions described by the EMS include lighting problems,
                                             high temperatures, poor ventilation, obstructed access and contamination by smoke,
                                             debris and dust [<a href="#R25">25</a>, <a href="#R32">32</a>, <a href="#R35">35</a>].

                                          <p id="d1e666">Challenges regarding communication are par for the course during incident response,
                                             and these issues are often augmented by an incident scene in a tunnel. There are several
                                             reasons for this. Firstly, technical difficulties commonly hamper communication in
                                             tunnel environments, which may isolate EMS responders from dispatch centers [<a href="#R32">32</a>, <a href="#R38">38</a>]. Secondly, two command posts and evacuation sites are often set up, since tunnel
                                             users escape in two directions, implying additional needs for coordination [<a href="#R31">31</a>, <a href="#R32">32</a>, <a href="#R38">38</a>]. Thirdly, the two command posts may report to different dispatch centers if the
                                             involved organizations belong to different districts or even different countries [<a href="#R29">29</a>, <a href="#R31">31</a>, <a href="#R38">38</a>]. Lastly, some tunnels have different operators responsible for different sections
                                             of the tunnel, who also need to be included in the response [<a href="#R30">30</a>]. Meanwhile the ability to manage the incidents significantly decreases if communication
                                             infrastructure fails by hampering communications between EMS responders, dispatch
                                             centers and hospitals. This in turn affect patient distribution with the risk of overwhelming
                                             receiving hospitals [<a href="#R34">34</a>, <a href="#R35">35</a>, <a href="#R39">39</a>]. Suggestions for overcoming communication difficulties on scene include using runners
                                             or cars [<a href="#R28">28</a>, <a href="#R31">31</a>], reserving priority lines in the mobile phone network, and using loudspeakers and
                                             megaphones to inform crowds [<a href="#R46">46</a>].

                                          <p id="d1e718">In terms of assessment, the tunnel environment typically means difficulties for the
                                             EMS to get an overview of the scene, which is necessary to determine what is happening
                                             and suitable tactics. This hampers the gathering of information by the EMS and means
                                             important decisions on what actions to take in the initial stages of response must
                                             be made on available and limited information, which may delay response [<a href="#R26">26</a>, <a href="#R27">27</a>]. One method used to gain information for assessment is through monitoring equipment
                                             installed in the tunnel combined with predetermined, well-thought-out communication
                                             and user interface. One study conclude that reduced visibility is the first critical
                                             mechanism that limits EMS assessment possibilities. Heat is the second mechanism that
                                             impedes emergency response or fire-fighting possibilities. Carbon monoxide does not
                                             pose a real threat to EMS responders with breathing apparatus, whereas the effect
                                             of falling rubble is a psychological barrier [<a href="#R25">25</a>].
                                          </p>
                                          <p id="d1e729">Suitability of the chosen assessment tactic depends on the type of fire, surrounding
                                             premises and number of people involved, which makes information gathering for EMS
                                             assessment one of the most important sub-goals initially. Another vital focus of assessment
                                             may be on the prevention of uncontrolled escalation of an incident, especially in
                                             tunnels that are imbedded in soft soil or beneath water level as the consequences
                                             could be catastrophic if the integrity of such tunnels failed [<a href="#R25">25</a>].
                                          </p>
                                          <p id="d1e734">The need for EMS responders and their effectiveness in versus outside the tunnel environment
                                             has to be considered and evaluated in each case. In several cases RS have transferred
                                             casualties from the most hazardous area on-scene to a place where EMS responders have
                                             taken over [<a href="#R31">31</a>, <a href="#R36">36</a>]. If an approach of advanced care by the EMS in a safe environment is chosen, it
                                             will amount to a very resource intensive effort if the number of injured people is
                                             large [<a href="#R27">27</a>]. Quickly moving the first found people is not always the most effective life-saving
                                             effort [<a href="#R27">27</a>]. However, in the aftermath of an explosion rapid removal of seriously injured with
                                             minimal medical intervention may be an appropriate response [<a href="#R32">32</a>]. In the response to the Gudvanga tunnel fire, EMS were released into the tunnel
                                             to pick up road users after the fire was determined to be under control, but the EMS
                                             responders turned around as they considered the area unsafe without protective equipment
                                             [<a href="#R31">31</a>]. There have also been instances where medically trained personnel among the public
                                             and EMS responders have died while trying to help casualties [<a href="#R36">36</a>].

                                          <p id="d1e761">The last three elements during incident response are more focused on the casualties
                                             and concern Triage, Treatment and Transport. Rapid arrival to the scene may be especially
                                             problematic for tunnel incidents as the transportation infrastructure itself is affected,
                                             which often results in road congestion [<a href="#R35">35</a>, <a href="#R38">38</a>]. Depending on whether it is an urban or rural scene some access issues may be overcome
                                             through use of bicycles, helicopters and reversal of traffic direction on certain
                                             stretches of road [<a href="#R35">35</a>, <a href="#R38">38</a>, <a href="#R45">45</a>]. Delayed dispatch, arrival or timing problems on scene have also resulted due to
                                             long distance to reach the injured, safety concerns, confusion regarding number of
                                             incidents or injured [<a href="#R32">32</a>, <a href="#R38">38</a>, <a href="#R47">47</a>]. Delayed response in combination with an incident development that often is rapid,
                                             constitute some factors why response to tunnel incidents is normally thought of as
                                             a two-phase process; an initial phase, which includes detection, alarm and self-rescue,
                                             followed by the emergency response intervention phase [<a href="#R44">44</a>].
                                          </p>
                                          <p id="d1e791">The most common types of tunnel incidents mentioned in the articles were fires, bombings,
                                             and tunnel collapses. Therefore, the treatment section focuses on inhalation injuries,
                                             blast injuries and crush injuries. In fire incidents, there have been instances were
                                             casualties have had burns on their skin even though their clothes have appeared unharmed.
                                             This was seen in the King’s Cross fire where people needed to be hosed down prior
                                             to treatment, as their clothes were too hot to touch [<a href="#R36">36</a>]. Considering smoke inhalation injury it is of utmost importance to realize that
                                             exposure to smoke in a tunnel will continue even though the fire is put out, dependent
                                             on natural wind and use of ventilation [<a href="#R31">31</a>]. Tunnel fires often result in long-term smoke exposure and relatively high smoke
                                             intensity and might be associated with additional complications as they can easily
                                             induce systemic poisoning [<a href="#R31">31</a>, <a href="#R48">48</a>]. Some of the most common mechanisms are absorption of toxic gases in the blood,
                                             inhalation of soot particles, and inhalation of bronchopulmonary toxins/irritants
                                             [<a href="#R31">31</a>]. The presence of soot and facial burns suggest a thermal lesion, which indicates
                                             direct cell injury and is associated with swelling and may complicate the first 24
                                             hours of treatment. As stated, in confined spaces the reflection of blast waves from
                                             walls and other surfaces creates complex waves of longer duration, which allow greater
                                             transfer of energy to the body, thereby increasing the risk of primary blast injuries.
                                             Moreover, inhalation of carbon monoxide and cyanide may cause systemic poisoning;
                                             a frequent and lethal problem resulting from fires in confined spaces. The main treatment
                                             consists of administering complementary oxygen until the injured person becomes asymptomatic.
                                             Death caused by hydrogen cyanide is not uncommon in casualties due to the burning
                                             of plastics [<a href="#R36">36</a>]. Supplemental oxygen (100%) is recommended in mild cases while patients with severe
                                             symptoms may benefit from methylene blue or transfusion of red blood cells [<a href="#R48">48</a>].

                                          <p id="d1e815">In case of collapse, some casualties become entombed which makes post-collapse rescue

                                 implications for the EMS response. Regarding the EMS response, research highlights
                                 communication issues due to overload or non-functional radios in tunnel environments,
                                 difficulties with getting an overview of the scene, and the lack of real-life experience
                                 or training in this specific environment, which could impede the evacuation and EMS
                                 response. Overall, there is a need for more research including the EMS perspective
                                 regarding tunnel incidents and training, but much can likely be clarified by merging
                                 already existent research and future projects using inter-disciplinary approaches,
                                 but also for a more extensive collaboration between different actors in the construction
                                 phase of tunnels. Compared to research on e.g. the injury mechanisms of terrorist
                                 attacks [<a href="#R51">51</a>], studies of the medical response to tunnel incidents are clearly lacking.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e2264">This review also found that safety is a huge concern. There are several safety-limitations
                                 for the EMS to apply offensive operational tactics in a threatened tunnel tube. Offensive
                                 action might result in endangering the lives of EMS responders, while the effects
                                 in terms of rescue are highly uncertain. In case of a fire, the conditions like visibility
                                 and temperature have usually deteriorated in such a way that an effective rescue operation
                                 is risky [<a href="#R25">25</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e2269">In the included studies, it has been shown that if an incident occurs in a tunnel,
                                 the immediate mortality rate and severity of injuries increase and the consequences
                                 may further be worsened as emergency services can be impeded from swift access and
                                 are constrained from using their normal work practices. Recent medical development
                                 and EMS training, such as the use of tourniquets and rapid transport to advanced trauma
                                 centers, has meant that injuries sustained in bombings, such as traumatic amputations,
                                 that were once considered a marker for a lethal outcome, are now survivable [<a href="#R51">51</a>, <a href="#R52">52</a>].

                                    <p id="d1e2280">There is a need to increase the specific knowledge of EMS response during major incidents
                                       in tunnels. To optimize the survival rates and health of the injured, as well as to
                                       provide a safe and effective work environment for the emergency services, there is
                                       a need to explore the event phase. Knowledge gained from the incident’s post-event
                                       phase and through exercises need to be explored, to better prepare responders for
                                       joint effective tactics. When it comes to prevention of MCI, there is also a lot to
                                       learn from table-top and full-scale exercises and actions taken when low-scale incidents
                                       were prevented from becoming large-scaled.

                                    <p id="d1e2282">Further investigation of specific challenges regarding information exchange, collaboration
                                       and initiatives for knowledge transfer between responders to provide prehospital care,
                                       and how to establish joint efforts in the emergency response (specifically during
                                       the initial event phase) is needed. Similarly, with regard to EMS care in major tunnel
                                       incidents where more offensive interventions are far away, preparation and practice
                                       is lacking.

                                    <p id="d1e2287">This study had the ambition to review information about emergency response and EMS
                                       care associated with incidents in tunnels. However, the existing literature presented
                                       few such examples, resulting in the inclusion of related issues and grey literature
                                       to a larger degree than initially planned.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e2289">Aspects that were problematic to fully map out were those that precede the care during
                                       rescue operations in tunnels. The difficulty in finding these issues partly lies in
                                       the systematic literature search methodology. It was a balance act to identify preventive
                                       actions that directly impacted the need and possibilities for an effective EMS response
                                       without also including indirect matters. It was especially challenging to find relevant
                                       information if “embedded” or surrounded by clearly irrelevant information, which resulted
                                       in the inclusion of articles that contained only a sentence or two of interest. Thus,
                                       the precondition aspects may not have been fully mapped out as, for example, studies
                                       focusing on technical matters and human behaviors in tunnel incidents were excluded
                                       while these might have (at least secondary) essential impact on EMS response and care.
