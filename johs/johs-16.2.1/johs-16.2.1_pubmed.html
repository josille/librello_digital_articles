                  <p class="first" id="d1e73">The world is increasingly interconnected - insecurity in one country can both directly
                     and indirectly affect the security of people, countries and regions that are far away.
                     Therefore, when conflict erupts in one part of the world, the international community
                     responds in various ways to mitigate its effects, both locally and internationally.
                     Whether it be through the provision of police, military and/or civilian personnel,
                     humanitarian assistance, or post-conflict development assistance, the international
                     community has repeatedly attempted to mitigate the effects of conflict, as well as
                     to contribute to reforms which might lead to the prevention of local and global insecurity
                     in the future.&nbsp;This Special Issue is dedicated to exploring community-oriented policing
                     (COP) and police reform in a series of post-conflict contexts: Kosovo, Guatemala,
                     Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia and Kenya. The papers are based on mixed-methods research
                     conducted under the EU-funded project ‘Community-Oriented Policing and Post-Conflict
                     Police Reform’ (ICT4COP 2015-2020). In this project, and in the papers in this special
                     issue, we explore how police reform in volatile contexts has taken place, and whether
                     a focus on COP approaches rather than militarized approaches might be more effective
                     in building trust, preventing violence and ensuring human security.

            <p id="d1e102">‘Conflict’ is a broad term that can range from low-level conflicts between individuals,
               to larger conflicts at sub-national or regional levels. In our research, the use of
               the term post-conflict refers to the period following an intense, violent conflict,
               and where there has been a particularly focused response nationally and/or internationally
               to improve relations between the government and its citizens, or within society in
               general, through peace building, development and SSR. The cases included in the project
               and this special issue have all experienced such larger conflicts, but the nature
               of conflict has of course been qualitatively different in each historical context.
               For example, in Kosovo there was ethnic violence, a war, and a contentious independence
               movement (1990-2008), in Guatemala, there was ethnic conflict and a lengthy civil
               war (1960-1996), in Afghanistan there was first an occupation by the USSR, and then
               a civil war (1979-2001), in Pakistan there was an armed conflict in the Swat Valley
               (2009) and unrest in the border areas with Afghanistan, in Kenya there has been decades
               of ethnic violence and a slew of terror attacks, and in Somalia there has been unrest
               and civil war that has stretched on for nearly thirty years. Each of these situations
               has yielded unique research insights, demonstrating that a diversity of contexts must
               be met by a diversity of approaches within COP.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e104">Within this diversity, however, there remains a common aim to gain stability and rebuild
               trust when armed conflict has ceased, both between the government and the population,
               and between different sectors of the population. However, it is important to note
               that despite the passing of a formal political peace process, violent conflict never
               completely ends [<a href="#R6">6</a>]. Conflict persists at several levels – pre-existing conflicts resurface, new conflicts
               emerge, and violence can be extreme. In one sense, conflict can be considered as a
               part of everyday life, and, therefore, something that cannot be ended completely,
               but its violent forms can be minimized. How conflict is understood will influence
               how states, donors, and local communities work to rebuild or transform their societies.
               With this in mind, it is particularly crucial to have a close awareness of the networks
               of power relations within which reform is implemented. In ‘Striving for the Impossible’
               (Hansen, this issue) [<a href="#R7">7</a>], for example, the distinctions of power relationships in post-conflict areas are
               categorized and tied to different strategies of reform, arguing that any approach
               that assumes that ‘one size fits all’ is unlikely to be effective. To explore the
               significance of contextual diversity of reform, we have in this research chosen a
               broad array of case studies representing different stages of conflict and reform,
               including those which are currently experiencing a resurgence of major conflict, such
               as Afghanistan.

               <p id="d1e115">Perhaps the most central concept framing our research is human security. Our choice
                  of human security as a framework is critically anchored in wider debates on security
                  and development in which issues of state building, peacebuilding, post-conflict violence,
                  SSR and COP are tightly embedded. Intensified interest in the relationship between
                  security and development, and the growing recognition of their close interlinkage,
                  led to the emergence of new thinking around security and development in the post-9/11
                  era of terrorism and the rise of global threats [<a href="#R8">8</a>]. A growing recognition of the failure of conventional security approaches to provide
                  the necessary conditions for sustainable development in critical contexts followed.
                  This has resulted in the emergence of new perspectives on the linkage between security
                  and development. Security and development were, for example, increasingly conceptualized
                  as mutually reinforcing and a central link in transitions from conflict to recovery
                  [<a href="#R9">9</a>]. Subsequently, development policies favored greater integration of security matters
                  while the scope of security policies moved to integrate development issues as well
                  [<a href="#R10">10</a>]. In practice, this resulted in the piloting of new constellations of collaboration
                  between the security and development sector, some of which have been highly criticized
                  due to the uneven influence of national and international security interests over
                  development principles in post-conflict contexts where the military is in the driver’s
                  seat of reconstruction policy [<a href="#R11">11</a>]. This was particularly problematic due to the clear focus on military perspectives
                  of security of the state and goals of stability in SSR.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e129">Despite the more recent inclusion of civilian dimensions in international SSR policy
                  [<a href="#R12">12</a>, <a href="#R13">13</a>, <a href="#R14">14</a>], practice continues to reflect a focus primarily on state security. Such an approach,
                  however, has at least two serious limitations. First, an uncritical focus on strengthening
                  state security can result in perverse outcomes such as international support for repressive
                  regimes and elites. Second, this perspective limits our understanding of how people
                  experience insecurities which fall outside of this conceptualization, but are nevertheless
                  experienced and perceived as very real threats to their lives and well-being. This
                  could include, for example, threats to health, livelihoods and resources, which may
                  be either directly or indirectly connected to a conflict, but in ways that may not
                  be so apparent from a military perspective. This can result in a police force trained
                  in military tactics and as a paramilitary force, rather than as a service to protect
                  the broader rights and interests of the population [<a href="#R15">15</a>]. For example, it is possible to observe this in the case of Afghanistan where police
                  at one point were trained by the military to increase the ‘boots on the ground’ needed
                  to face the threat of insurgents, at the expense of training in regular policing skills
                  [<a href="#R16">16</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e146">While the debates around the security-development nexus provided a critical view of
                  two competing worldviews on local and global relations, they did not offer much in
                  terms of an analytical perspective that could bridge these two worlds in a constructive
                  and innovative way. This is where human security was seen to fill the gap. The term
                  was originally coined in 1994 by the UN as freedom from want, and freedom from fear,
                  and expanded in 2003 to include freedom to live in dignity. While much of the early
                  focus was on finding a definition and listing of what types of insecurities comprise
                  human security [<a href="#R17">17</a>], the emphasis has shifted to an understanding of human security in broader, processual
                  terms. Gasper [<a href="#R18">18</a>], for example, examines human security with respect to whose security, security of
                  what, to what extent, and against what threats, and its purpose. In doing so, he identifies
                  a range of definitions, which comprise different human security discourses depending
                  on the purpose and needs of the actors. Some of these definitions are narrow, for
                  example as a security or interventionist policy [<a href="#R19">19</a>], while others are rather broad, encompassing all of human development [<a href="#R20">20</a>, <a href="#R21">21</a>]. Common to many, and important for our research, is a focus on people rather than
                  the state as the object of insecurity, a move beyond physical violence as the only
                  threat, the interconnectedness of threats, and an understanding of humans as more
                  than individuals but part of a social, political context, and as both vulnerable and
                  capable [<a href="#R22">22</a>]. Human security in this sense is both broadened in terms of what constitutes a threat
                  and narrowed to focus on contextual and normative priorities [<a href="#R17">17</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e170">The implications of choosing a human security approach for our research are many.
                  Analytically, a human security discourse provides us with an intellectual bridge between
                  disciplines, sectors and stakeholders. In doing so, it has enabled researchers, policymakers,
                  and practitioners within security, development, policing, technology, political science
                  and anthropology to engage with each other and directly with local women and men to
                  understand and address the complexities inherent in a variety of post conflict contexts.
                  A focus on human security has, thus, had significant implications for our methodologies.
                  We investigate, for example, the ways in which different people define their own experiences
                  of threats to their well-being. To access this information we have employed a qualitative,
                  narrative, anthropological and co-productive methodology in our field studies. We
                  have a strong focus on exploring the contextuality of insecurity. This has required
                  us to pay attention to historical, social and political understandings of conflict
                  and reform processes in each case. We do not only consider vulnerabilities and issues
                  of protection, but capabilities and issues of empowerment i.e. considering how people
                  work to secure their lives in light of conflict and insecurities, individually, collectively
                  and through local state and non-state institutions. We consider the interconnectedness
                  of insecurities in a particular context, and how they interact in each case to result
                  in a particular constellation of roles, responsibilities and outcomes that are relevant
                  for understanding human security. This allows us, for example, to not only critically
                  analyze how police perform their duties in these challenging contexts, but their role
                  in relation to other state and non-state institutions, and to civil society, in addressing
                  and preventing insecurities. Again, this often has different features in each of the
                  cases, as they represent particular histories and institutional constellations.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e172">An important dimension of our use of human security is our focus on the social foundations
                  of power relations, and how they influence the ways in which police reform is both
                  implemented and practiced. We consider, for example, how unequal power relations between
                  the international community (military and police advisors) and local, relatively weak
                  post-conflict governments influence the way in which community policing is designed
                  and implemented both nationally and locally [<a href="#R23">23</a>, <a href="#R24">24</a>]. This power imbalance has sparked concern that the international community has introduced
                  COP and that it represents not only an adherence to liberal peace strategies [<a href="#R25">25</a>, <a href="#R26">26</a>, <a href="#R27">27</a>] by powerful nations in international politics, but also a Western philosophy and
                  policing strategy that is irrelevant to different settings abroad. The role of the
                  international community in COP implementation is discussed in detail in several articles
                  in the first special issue [<a href="#R16">16</a>, <a href="#R28">28</a>, <a href="#R29">29</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e199">Likewise, power relations within and between national government actors, non-government
                  actors, security actors, civil society and local communities are also examined, including
                  issues of youth, gendered relations and the position of vulnerable groups. In this
                  issue, Gjelsvik’s article on the case of Kenya demonstrates how unique power structures
                  between (and within) civil society, the police and the state have provided a challenging
                  landscape for any success from its two state-led COP initiatives [<a href="#R30">30</a>].

               <p id="d1e204">Coenders’ article illustrates unique youth perspectives on rampant systematic corruption,
                  nepotism, and incompetency in the Kosovo police, and reveals the security needs of
                  a largely overlooked group [<a href="#R31">31</a>]. Likewise, Ganapathy, Nimruzi, Ullah’s article on Afghanistan and Pakistan compares
                  how youth are both vulnerable and a resource, whose empowerment (or disempowerment)
                  in society hold significant consequences for the future of both countries [<a href="#R32">32</a>]. In all of our cases, we see that the inclusion of power relations at all levels
                  enables a more critical and complex analysis of the possibilities and limitations
                  faced in police reform that go beyond an instrumental understanding of challenges
                  in terms of lack of resources and training.

            <p id="d1e215">There is broad agreement that without community involvement and support, police reform
               efforts have little chance to prove successful [<a href="#R15">15</a>, <a href="#R33">33</a>, <a href="#R34">34</a>, <a href="#R35">35</a>]. COP is thus now widely recognized as a relevant approach to policing and restoring
               trust in police/community relations even in post-conflict contexts. Despite decades
               of research on COP, however, there remains a lack of consensus on both its definition
               and practice (See for example [<a href="#R24">24</a>, <a href="#R36">36</a>, <a href="#R37">37</a>, <a href="#R38">38</a>, <a href="#R39">39</a>, <a href="#R40">40</a>, <a href="#R41">41</a>, <a href="#R42">42</a>, <a href="#R43">43</a>]). Thus, COP is understood and implemented differently in different contexts across
               the globe. Our research tries to fill some of the gaps in our understanding of what
               COP is, and how it might contribute to post-conflict police reform. There are three
               issues we feel are important to note at this point: focus on community, the challenges
               and opportunities of diversity of definition, and the challenges of international
               police assistance in reform.

               <p id="d1e261">As mentioned in the previous section, a focus on human security in police reform shifts
                  attention to addressing people’s insecurities, and a focus on COP could offer a strategy
                  to do so. While COP does have an inherent focus on community as a subject of security,
                  there is a nevertheless a lack of attention in the COP literature to how the community
                  should in fact be understood. Who is the community in COP? Research and analysis on
                  COP has largely ignored people and their engagement in police reform and democratization
                  processes. The diversity of people themselves, the changes that they have lived through
                  both during and after decades of conflict, and their relation to governmental law
                  enforcement agencies like the police has not been adequately addressed [<a href="#R44">44</a>, <a href="#R45">45</a>]. We therefore suggest that the thinking and practice of COP could benefit from more
                  attention to ‘community’ through an in-depth qualitative understanding and integration
                  of local experiences [<a href="#R24">24</a>]. Our research offers insight from extensive interviews with local community members,
                  including vulnerable groups such as women, youth and minorities, who reflect on both
                  their own insecurities, and the possibilities of building trust between the police
                  and communities. Noteworthy examples in this issue include the articles from Kosovo
                  (Coenders, this issue) [<a href="#R31">31</a>] and Afghanistan and Pakistan (Ganapathy, Nimruzi, Ullah, this issue) [<a href="#R32">32</a>], which feature thorough perspectives from youth and women in each of these areas.
                  Additionally, research from Kenya in this issue [<a href="#R30">30</a>] represents a variety of voices from women’s, youth, human rights, and religious
                  organizations.

               <p id="d1e285">The diversity of definitions of COP is also challenging for police reform. Studies
                  focusing on post-conflict police reform see the role of COP differently. Some focus
                  on the way COP might contribute to police effectiveness in terms of quality, responsiveness
                  and accountability of police services. Others focus on engaging with communities for
                  community-based solutions to local issues re-establishing the broken links between
                  communities and police, establishing them where they may never have existed, or re-negotiating
                  them where they were poor in the past, improving public perceptions of the police,
                  and rehabilitating the police institution in a way that encourages citizens to trust,
                  interact and support their police in preventing, reporting and fighting crime and
                  terrorism [<a href="#R46">46</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e290">While such diversity can lead to experimentation and innovation towards improvements
                  in human security, it can also result in lack of clarity and competing perspectives,
                  which may hinder positive effects of reforms, both internationally and nationally.
                  In <i>Police Reform and Community Policing in Kenya</i> (Gjelsvik, this issue) [<a href="#R30">30</a>], the different approaches to COP implemented by different parts of the security
                  sector, within the same country, implemented side-by-side, has earned COP the reputation
                  as being “a chameleon”, due to its “vagueness around initiatives” [<a href="#R47">47</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e301">This has done little to enlist the trust of communities, particularly in light of
                  Kenya’s colonial policing history. This research reveals that COP initiatives failed
                  to take account of this history, where the police were beset by corruption and were
                  often a source of violence and even in some cases criminal activity. Community participation
                  in COP was therefore low out of fear that individuals who collaborated with the police
                  would have their names recorded and even be punished for participation. Each approach
                  is as well aligned with different political interests, which again have different
                  perspectives on what the role of the police in fact is in terms of its interaction
                  with communities.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e303">In our research we ask what we can learn from this diversity. We ask whether there
                  are ways of understanding trust-building, accountability, government-civil society
                  relationships that are contextually specific, but can nevertheless inform an understanding
                  of COP on a broader level. Indeed, we hope this might provide some new insight that
                  can be used to improve reform processes and contribute to improved human security
                  for all. What we are learning from our cases, is that post-conflict reform processes
                  have tended to focus on administrative and territorial questions, as well as the activities
                  of international actors and the specific interests of donors, rather than on the specific
                  interests and needs of citizens. While the steps required to promote COP in postcolonial
                  Kenya may differ greatly from those of indigenous areas of Guatemala, we do witness
                  general commonalities between these cases. This diversity of cases emphasizes the
                  need to address human concerns to foster trust between communities and police, and
                  the need for well-funded programs in which participants fully understand they are
                  being heard.

               <p id="d1e308">Whilst COP is now widely recognized as a strategic aspect of police assistance programs,
                  how it relates to conventional approaches to police reform needs to be studied more
                  closely. Institutional reforms of the police in post-conflict settings has often involved
                  support to, for example, institutional re-structuring, establishment of and improvements
                  in police training and education systems, human capacity building in both operations
                  and strategy development, and upgrading of equipment. The focus has often been on
                  improving police efficiency and effectiveness in maintaining the rule of law and can
                  also involve links to reforms of the judiciary and prison sectors. In the aftermath
                  of armed conflict, however, police-community relations and trust levels in society
                  in general are typically very low. In our project we have tried to identify how police
                  reform processes can contribute to greater cooperation between law enforcement agencies
                  and citizens in post-conflict contexts. In some cases this dynamic is complicated
                  by histories in which citizens may have recently been the victims of abuse by the
                  same law enforcement agencies before, during and post-conflict.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e310">The increased attention to COP in police reform in international police missions,
                  however, has proved challenging. International police advisors often experience frustration
                  in their missions, and typically report a lack of adequate knowledge on COP and the
                  specific contexts in which they conduct their assignments [<a href="#R48">48</a>]. They often rely on their national understanding of COP, even when working on developing
                  ‘locally owned’ forms of COP for the country where they are posted. They can as well
                  face ethical dilemmas when local institutions seem at odds with international human
                  rights. Likewise, national actors may feel that COP is a Western approach to policing
                  that is imposed upon them. They may experience a lack of consideration of and respect
                  for existing traditional conflict resolution and justice institutions and mechanisms
                  when COP is being designed and implemented.
                  
               </p>
               <p id="d1e315">The tensions arising at the interface of international, government and traditional
                  institutions is a recurring theme in several of our research cases. Rather than fall
                  into an essentialist, binary discussion of what such relations and roles should be,
                  our cases attempt to unravel the complexities and dilemmas inherent in these interfaces.
                  The article on state institution building notes that supporters, donors and facilitators
                  of security sector and police reform often expect a Western configuration of the state,
                  where responsibility is clearly located in a uniform organizational hierarchy (Hansen,
                  this issue) [<a href="#R7">7</a>]. By distinguishing four drastically different configurations of (state) power organization,
                  the importance of recognizing, understanding, and often working with non-state security
                  providers within COP efforts is made readily apparent. These cases demonstrate that
                  we need a more nuanced understanding of these relationships in order to move beyond
                  a view of local institutions as always a problem, and international assistance as
                  always an imposition.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e320">There is also need for a discussion regarding the institutionalization and sustainability
                  of COP in police reform assistance. When international actors depart and national
                  actors take over, COP activities may continue as planned, be discontinued, or change
                  into something quite different. While some would see the last two as failures, they
                  could in fact represent adaption to actual local needs [<a href="#R49">49</a>]. On the other hand, if COP continues, is it a clear sign of its institutionalization
                  and sustainability? The article on Kenya notes that, despite the existence of two
                  state-led COP models, a broad gap remains between communities and police. Although
                  the vision and programming for the cultivation of a people-centered police exists,
                  too many pre-existing issues (police abuse, low trust, etc.) remain unaddressed. As
                  a result, these initiatives serve to maintain the status quo rather than challenge
                  problematic societal power structures, and true community-police collaboration remains
                  a concept rather than a reality (Gjelsvik, this issue) [<a href="#R30">30</a>]. The article on Kosovo details that despite COP implementation over many years,
                  youths lack faith in their police due to lack of proper funding, training, performance
                  and consistency; efforts to make COP both successful and sustainable would require
                  these important perceptions to be addressed first (Coenders, this issue) [<a href="#R31">31</a>]. Similarly, Matute’s article on Guatemala in this issue [<a href="#R50">50</a>] notes that, without continued funding for activities, police will be forced to continue
                  to rely on reactive policing techniques to address high levels of violence. Finally,
                  Hansen’s article in this issue reiterates that it is crucial to incorporate local
                  contacts and institutions where possible, to assist and relieve police from ongoing
                  threats [6]. In Afghanistan, police-community consultative groups are one example
                  of how concepts of COP have been sustained through the traditional concept of the
                  <i>shura</i> [<a href="#R51">51</a>], which have provided venues for youth to express their security concerns. These
                  cases illustrate that institutionalization and sustainability of COP are not only
                  a function of how well a program is designed—they are influenced by wider social relations
                  and political processes often outside of the control of the policing system.

            <p id="d1e344">In addition to contextual aspects of policing systems, there are major gaps in the
               literature regarding the use of technology for COP and its ability to facilitate cooperation
               between police and citizens in these difficult contexts. As information and communication
               technologies (ICT) are rapidly developing and spreading, their use by police is increasingly
               discussed, also in the case of police assistance missions abroad. Most of the focus
               has been in using ICT to improve police efficiency, surveillance and crime reporting.
               Much less focus has been on how to use ICT in COP to improve communications and build
               trust between the police and communities. In our project we have attempted to identify
               what possibilities and limitations exist for the use of ICT for COP. Given the difficult
               contexts of intervention and the increased sensitivity of data integrity issues associated
               with the use of technologies in such contexts, the use of ICT remains a challenge.
               A key question we have asked in our work is: How do we ensure that ICT for COP is
               not co-opted for increased surveillance and the creation of a police state?
            </p>
            <p id="d1e346">In the first special issue, Maqsood <i>et al.</i> the South Asian paper considers the different types of technologies used in policing
               in the region, and suggests that there is a potential for expanding the range of ICTs
               to go beyond their use for efficiency and surveillance, to contribute to trust-building
               [<a href="#R52">52</a>]. While this is a relatively new area for policing, the use of ICTs for development
               began in the 1950s. The field of ICT for Development (ICT4D) can therefore provide
               useful experience around the contribution of technology to social, economic and environmental
               development. Mobile technology, for example, has been used to facilitate service delivery
               when other types of traditional infrastructure are lacking [<a href="#R53">53</a>]. In Guatemala, WhatsApp has become a commonly-used tool for police to communicate
               with community representatives and with each other, while other tools such as image
               sharing and portable electronic fingerprint identifiers have facilitated police responses
               to crimes and emergencies (Matute, this issue) [<a href="#R50">50</a>]. ICT4D scholars have also developed frameworks for ethical aspects [<a href="#R54">54</a>] and for identifying risks and challenges in the use of ICT for development that
               might inform discussions of ICT for COP [<a href="#R55">55</a>]. The particular challenges faced by youth described in this issue demonstrate the
               need for police to better utilize ICT to develop trust. For example, in Kosovo, youth
               reporting a stolen iPad to police lost faith in police upon learning that the responding
               officers were not aware of a popular app used to track stolen mobile devices (Coenders,
               this issue) [<a href="#R31">31</a>]. Although staying up-to-date with the ways that youth use ICT (social media in particular)
               can be a challenge for police, it may provide an opportunity improve communication
               and alleviate insecurities between police and a vulnerable cross-section of society.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e370">The challenges for ICT for COP are similar for those for ICT4D, including access and
               availability of technology infrastructure, privacy and security issues and the design
               of effective and affordable feedback loops, ICT capacity building for public sector
               actors, the strategic use of already available technologies, the integration of global
               and local experiences, and monitoring and evaluation [<a href="#R56">56</a>]. Particularly challenging for ICT in both development and COP is the use of bottom-up
               approaches such as participatory technology development [<a href="#R57">57</a>]. In policing, technology development is typically top-down and controlled by the
               police, who may neither trust the population, nor enjoy their trust. There is also
               a tendency to believe that technical solutions alone can replace the need for face-to-face
               communication. Evidence from our research suggests that is not so, particularly in
               contexts with trust deficits. In the first special issue, we saw that before recent
               mistakes, the Nicaraguan model had been successful largely based on its human and
               not technological interface [<a href="#R58">58</a>]. Technologies are likely only a small part of a trust-building process, the nature
               of which are dependent on the context. The way a government, and particularly the
               police, uses technology may in fact be an indicator of how they view their relationship
               with civil society. In Pakistan, improving the image of the police and their relationship
               with communities is promoted using ICT at both national and provincial levels, but
               at the same time, the government has intensified its control of social media content
               and the use of online surveillance technology [<a href="#R52">52</a>, <a href="#R59">59</a>]. The articles in the current issue explore in depth issues of building trust, particularly
               with vulnerable populations, which, in turn, should be in the forefront as police
               consider how they will use ICTs in the future.

            <p id="d1e390">While it may seem that COP is merely the performance of a series of consultations,
               dialogues, and joint activities using good communication skills, as a policing approach
               it touches on the very essence of how governments relate to their populations. In
               the case of Kenya (Gjelsvik, this issue) [<a href="#R30">30</a>], a historical precedent of abuse by police dating back to the colonial era, coupled
               with frequent violations of confidentiality for informants has discouraged cooperation
               between citizens and police, undermining COP efforts that aim to link the two groups.
               Instead, two separate COP efforts exist simultaneously, one of which operates largely
               outside of the police (Nyumba Kumi) while the other includes police (CPCs), resulting
               in political tension and confusion, rather than increased trust between the government
               and communities. In Guatemala, (Matute, this issue) [<a href="#R50">50</a>], there remains little knowledge of COP among civil society, and where it is known
               it is often viewed with distrust based on the violent and repressive role of the police
               historically. Groups that are aware of COP expressed very different understandings
               of its meaning, with major variations between foreign donors, the government, civil
               society, and the police. Location has a significant effect on the degree of adaptation
               of COP: in areas with higher indigenous populations such as Totonicapan, police cooperate
               with representatives of indigenous municipalities that “have the final say”. However,
               this is contrasted in more urban areas such as Villa Canales, where spaces set aside
               for police-community communication are not regularly utilized . Finally, in the case
               of Kosovo (Coenders, this issue) [<a href="#R31">31</a>], youth reported that their efforts to report crime often went ignored by police,
               or that the police simply weren’t capable of taking action on any information they
               were provided.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e401">The papers in this and the previous special issue offer insight into how community-oriented
               policing is practiced and understood in each specific context. They also illustrate
               the emergence of several common themes that need to be addressed when attempting to
               understand COP in post-conflict contexts. These include the following: the significance
               of political, social and gendered power relations at international, national and local
               levels; continued tensions within the police/government and between the need for surveillance
               and control and the provision of services to communities, limited understanding of
               the role of civil society and local institutions in COP, lack of attention to the
               insecurities of vulnerable populations such as women, youth and minorities, limited
               awareness of the potentials and dangers of the use of ICTs in these contexts, and
               the challenges of trust-building in societies where trust both between the police/government
               and society, and within society itself after conflict are clearly in a deficit. In
               subsequent publication and research we will continue to address and further develop
               these insights.
