                  <p class="first" id="d1e130">The present study discusses the role of NGOs in the efforts of the Indonesian Humanitarian
                     Alliance for Myanmar (AKIM: Aliansi Kemanusian Indonesia Untuk Myanmar) to handle
                     the humanitarian crisis experienced by Ethnic Rohingya groups in Myanmar in 2017.
                     This phenomenon in Myanmar began to draw a lot of attention when the AKIM was able
                     to contribute to the cause even though state actors and IGO attempts were blocked
                     by the Myanmar government. In this case, NGOs were able to play a role outside the
                     traditional structure of modern international relations that was inaccessible to state
                     or international organizations (IGOs) or state governments. This phenomenon indicates
                     that NGOs have more access to attempts to settle the humanitarian crisis being experienced
                     by the ethnic Rohingya groups in Myanmar. This is notable because the Myanmar government
                     has blocked the aid of other countries and IGOs and has denied the assistance offered
                     by the United Nations. The qualitative method was used in this study, employing a
                     case study model to observe the effects that occurred. During data collection researchers,
                     used study documents, and then the data was processed through interpretive analytical
                     techniques to draw conclusions and formulate a model for the study.

            <p id="d1e145">There have been many conflicts between ethnic groups since Myanmar became an independent
               country in 1948. One of the interethnic conflicts attracting the most attention from
               the international community is the conflict between the Rohingya (Muslim) ethnic group
               and the majority Rakhine (Buddhist) community. This conflict has made the Rohingyas
               victims in an extraordinary humanitarian crisis. Conflicts in the Rakhine region have
               continued to occur, and the Myanmar government has yet to develop a political policy
               to overcome the conflicts and reduce the violence experienced by the Ethnic Rohingya
               group. The conflict forced most of the Rohingya to flee to various other countries
               to save themselves [<a href="#R1">1</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e150">Ethnic Rohingyas have experienced numerous discrimination and human rights violations.
               One example of this was a suppression event that took place in 1962 when General Ne
               Win executed a coup and seized control of the Myanmar government. Once in power, his
               regime immediately carried out military operations to attack the separatists from
               the Ethnic Rohingya group. One of the military operations launched in 1978, known
               as ’Operation Dragon King’ (Naga Min), caused more than 200,000 Rohingyas to flee
               to Bangladesh as a result of violence, murder, and rape. The Bangladeshi government
               declared a protest against Myanmar over the influx of Rohingya refugees in their territory.
               In July 1978, the United Nations mediated discussions on the situation, and the Myanmar
               government agreed to accept Rohingya immigrants for the return of Rakhine and so on,
               based on information from Amnesty International. This occurred after various discriminatory
               actions, and the suppression of humanitarian rule carried out by the Myanmar military
               junta [<a href="#R2">2</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e155">The Rohingya are not recognized as citizens of Myanmar and are thus under pressure
               from the ethnic majority in Myanmar, most of whom are Buddhist. The Buddhist and Muslim
               communities in Arakan could live in harmony during the pre-colonialism era. However,
               with the regime change that controlled Arakan, and the entry of British colonies in
               Myanmar which led to the emergence of a spirit of nationalism by the Myanmar people
               in general which was based on religious identity, the Rohingya began to be marginalized
               by identity. The regime change that occurred in 1962, at which time the ruling military
               mobilized extraordinary violence against the Rohingya ethnic group by raising the
               issue of racism and xenophobia for political purposes, made the Rohingya ethnic identity
               look completely different from the majority Buddhist community of Myanmar. According
               to Arnab Roy Chowdhury, discrimination experienced by the Rohingya ethnicity is strongly
               influenced by striking differences in identity. The majority Buddhist Myanmar community
               considers that the Rohingya ethnic identity and religious identity are closer to the
               people of Bangladesh [<a href="#R3">3</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e160">Understanding the history of the origins of the Rohingya ethnicity also makes the
               position of the Rohingya ethnic groups often getting into trouble among Myanmar’s
               majority society. The Rohingya people claim that they have occupied the Arakan area
               long before the colonial era. They even claim that the Arakan region has been controlled
               by Muslim kings since the fifteenth century. This understanding then influences the
               different views historically between the majority community in Myanmar and the Rohingya
               ethnic community itself. Even this historical understanding has always taken an active
               role in the political dimension in Myanmar. Every regime in power cannot be separated
               from the issue of differences in identity and historical understanding inherent in
               the Rohingya ethnicity. Even a regime that is expected to be democratic under the
               leadership of Aung San Suu Kyi, who won the 2012 election with his National League
               for Democracy (NLD) party, cannot escape the issue of identity and history of the
               Rohingya ethnicity. The political interests of the elite put the Rohingya in no place
               for politicians in Myanmar to fight for [<a href="#R4">4</a>]. The issue of identity and historical understanding maintained by the ruling regimes
               in Myanmar triggered large-scale human rights violations experienced by the Rohingya
               ethnic group in Myanmar. This condition is one of the reasons that most Rohingya seek
               asylum and become refugees in other countries. Their struggle to save themselves from
               the violence experienced in Myanmar raises new problems, especially for the countries
               to which they are aiming to flee, particularly Bangladesh, which is the main place
               the Rohingya have been seeking protection [<a href="#R5">5</a>]. The Bangladeshi government faces a dilemma when dealing with refugees from Myanmar.
               For now, the Rohingya can be seen as refugees who must be given humanitarian assistance,
               but for the Bangladesh government, in the long run, the Rohingya will become a source
               of conflict [<a href="#R6">6</a>]. These conditions make it increasingly difficult for Ethnic Rohingya groups in their
               efforts to fight for their own human rights.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e171">The current Ethnic Rohingya status is stateless, and therefore they have no national
               protection or rights as legal citizens in Myanmar or in any other country. This violates
               the general concept of human rights, especially in relation to the concept of the
               International Bill of Human Rights (the Universal Declaration of Human Rights), especially
               Articles 13, 14, and 15. These describe a person’s right to obtain citizenship status
               and protection from oppression. Article 13, Paragraphs 1 and 2, confirms these rights,
               explaining the following: (1) Everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence
               within the borders of each state, and (2) Everyone has the right to leave any country,
               including his own, and to return to his country. Similarly, Article 14, Paragraphs
               1 and 2 say this: (1) Everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy asylum from persecution
               in other countries. (2) This right may not be invoked in the case of prosecutions
               genuinely arising from non-political crimes or acts contrary to the purposes and principles
               of the United Nations. Next, Article 15, Verses 1 and 2 presents these ideas: (1)
               Everyone has the right to a nationality. (2) No one shall be arbitrarily deprived
               of his nationality nor denied the right to change his nationality [<a href="#R7">7</a>]. The Ethnic Rohingyaity’s right to have a clear citizenship status has been taken
               away despite their having lived in Myanmar for centuries. All forms of discrimination
               and violence experienced by ethnic Rohingya in Myanmar are violations of human rights.
               Acknowledgment of human rights is stated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
               especially Articles 3, 5, and 18. Article 3 reads as follows: <i>Everyone has the right to life, liberty, and security of person. Then article 5 which
                  reads: No one shall be subjected to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment
                  or punishment. And next is article 18 which reads: Everyone has the right to freedom
                  of thought, conscience, and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion
                  or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or
                  private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship, and observance</i> [<a href="#R7">7</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e182">The articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, clearly proclaim protection
               for human beings from all forms of persecution and acts of violence. In addition,
               they guarantee a sense of security and freedom of religion. Notably, this Declaration
               is explicitly adopted to define the meaning of the terms’ fundamental freedom’ and
               ‘human rights’ as they appear in the UN Charter, which is binding for all member states.
               For this reason, the Universal Declaration is a fundamental constitutive document
               of the United Nations. Besides, many international lawyers have argued that the Declaration
               is part of customary international law. Thus, it is a powerful tool in applying diplomatic
               and moral pressure to governments violating the contents of the articles of the Declaration.
               In 1968 at the International Conference on Human Rights, the United Nations suggested
               that the Declaration ‘is an obligation for the members of the international community’,
               and applies to all people. Therefore, Myanmar has violated this Declaration, which
               should apply to the entire international community without exception [<a href="#R8">8</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e187">Some of the Ethnic Rohingya communities have attempted to survive in Myanmar, even
               though they experience pressure and violence both from the military and from the Rakhine
               (Buddhist) community. In August 2017, hundreds of Rohingya died because they experienced
               violence from the Myanmar military. This outbreak of conflict between the Ethnic Rohingya
               community and the Myanmar military further exacerbated the conditions of the Rohingya
               who remained in Rakhine. This phenomenon attracted the attention of the international
               community, inciting a desire to provide humanitarian assistance to the victims. Ethnic
               Rohingya experienced an extraordinary humanitarian crisis at that time. During this
               humanitarian crisis, the Myanmar government closed all access to outside assistance
               aimed at the Ethnic Rohingya group, who were experiencing hunger and were in dire
               need of such assistance.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e189">The Indonesian government took a stand for giving sympathy to the Ethnic Rohingya
               groups, even deciding in 2015 to accept Myanmar refugees after being pressured by
               the majority of the people in Indonesia [<a href="#R9">9</a>]. Indonesian people who are predominantly Muslim gave support and condemned the actions
               taken by the Myanmar government and the majority of the Buddhist community in Rakhine.
               However, the Indonesian government cannot change Myanmar’s closing access to humanitarian
               aid to Rohingyas. Even humanitarian assistance from the UN cannot be channeled due
               to a blockade from the Myanmar government [<a href="#R10">10</a>]. In 2017, the Indonesian government formed AKIM (the Indonesian Humanitarian Alliance
               for Myanmar), which consists of 11 humanitarian NGOs in Indonesia. Humanitarian assistance,
               which comes from both the government and civil society donations, can be channeled
               by AKIM to the Ethnic Rohingya group in Myanmar through collaboration with local NGOs
               from Myanmar.

            <p id="d1e200">This study used a descriptive and analytic framework within the broader framework
               of a qualitative research model. According to John W. Creswell, qualitative research
               is a method for exploring and understanding the meaning that some individuals or groups
               of people think come from social or humanitarian problems [<a href="#R11">11</a>]. Meanwhile, in this study, the authors chose a case study research strategy within
               a broad framework of qualitative research. Where, according to Stake, a case study
               is a research strategy in which researchers carefully investigate a program, event,
               activity, process, or group of individuals. Cases are limited by time and activity,
               and researchers collect complete information using various data collection procedures
               based on a predetermined time [<a href="#R12">12</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e208">In the data collection process, the writer uses written secondary data. Or this method
               is often known as the ‘‘library research’’ method, where the author collects data
               to support the argument by collecting data from various sources such as written reports,
               books or literature, journals, newspapers, magazines, or data. data sourced from the
               internet. Besides, the author also interviewed one of the NGO leaders who was a member
               of AKIM. From the data that has been obtained, the author selects data, where the
               information obtained, will be taken only from sources deemed to have good validity.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e210">Regarding data analysis, the author uses an understanding according to John W Creswell,
               which states that data analysis is a continuous process that requires continuous reflection
               on data, asks analytical questions, and writes short notes throughout the study [<a href="#R11">11</a>]. Then Creswell added that there are steps that must be taken in the process of data
               analysis and interpretation. Among them: (1) processing and preparing data. In this
               case, the author prepares the data that has been obtained, both data obtained from
               the results of literature studies, or data obtained from interviews. (2) read the
               entire data. At this stage, the writer will read and understand the general idea of
               the data that has been obtained. (3) analyzing data. At this stage, the authors conducted
               an in-depth analysis of the data. Besides, the authors also interpret or interpret
               the collected data in the form of text or images.

               by the Ethnic Rohingya group in Myanmar in 2017. Furthermore, this paper will provide
               an analysis of the limited roles of the state and IGOs in handling this humanitarian
               crisis. In this case, the role of NGOs is more significant than that of other countries
               or IGOs. This study used an inductive approach, in which the main objective was to
               create a model illustrating the role of NGOs in a modern international relations scheme.
               This revealed that in some instances, the roles of the state and IGOs are limited,
               and NGOs can provide aid in carrying out this work.

            <p id="d1e220">The inclusion of NGOs in handling humanitarian crises is not new. Margaret E. Keck
               and Kathryn Sikkink created a boomerang pattern (boomerang effect). In this model,
               NGOs can aid in suppressing a country when that country is considered to have violated
               an international norm. These authors further explained that when a country acts in
               violation of international norms, the role of NGOs is to disseminate information to
               the international community, as well as to gain support from other countries or intergovernmental
               organizations (IGOs). Following these efforts, other countries and IGOs will press
               the country in question to reinstate international norms [<a href="#R13">13</a>] (Figure <a href="#Fig1">1</a>).
            </p>
            <p id="d1e228">Furthermore, the role of NGOs in the enforcement of human rights norms in the era
               of globalization is inevitable. NGOs have become some of the more important actors
               in these matters beyond the state that influences the implementation of specific human
               rights values. NGOs, which are representative of their communities, can penetrate
               national borders and take actions that cannot be carried out by the state. Some of
               the efforts of NGOs to enforce human rights norms include conducting human rights
               education; monitoring, investigating, and documenting human rights; setting standards
               and procedures, advocating and lobbying; and encouraging the process of democratization
               and development [<a href="#R14">14</a>]. State actors cannot execute these activities under certain conditions (such as
               the case of the Rohingya in Myanmar); for instance, the case discussed here excludes
               other state actors because it involves the sovereignty of Myanmar itself.

               able to contribute where the Myanmar government blocks state actors and IGOs. In this
               case, modern international relations allow NGOs to play a role that cannot be performed
               by the state or international organizations or among other state governments. The
               role of the AKIM in the case of the humanitarian crisis in Myanmar can be illustrated

                  the Ethnic Rohingya Humanitarian Crisis in Myanmar in 2017: An Analysis
               </h3>
               <p id="d1e264">The humanitarian crisis in Myanmar has become an international concern. One of the
                  cases of human rights violations that has attracted global attention is related to
                  the status of the Ethnic Rohingya who did not have citizenship; the group is stateless.
                  The rejection of the Ethnic Rohingya as Myanmar citizens by the majority of the people
                  and government of Myanmar is the main cause of the human rights violations inflicted
                  on the Ethnic Rohingya. The striking differences in ethnicity and culture have collectively
                  become the main weapon for the majority of people who reject the Ethnic Rohingya in
                  Myanmar. The differences in ethnicity and culture are supported by history, which
                  reveals that the Rohingya are immigrants. For this reason, the Ethnic Rohingya identity
                  differs from the ethnicities of most of the people in Myanmar, so the former are rejected
                  as citizens of Myanmar [<a href="#R17">17</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e269">In 2017, the violence experienced by the Rohingya people in Myanmar caused many casualties.
                  In just one week, approximately 400 people were killed [<a href="#R18">18</a>]. This dangerous situation created waves of refugees. The Ethnic Rohingya community
                  chose to flee to save themselves from military operations carried out by the Myanmar
                  government. In a single month, the number of Rohingya refugees from August to September
                  2017 reached 123,000 people [<a href="#R19">19</a>]. Many refugees have fled Myanmar, as shown in the following is a graph of refugees
                  from Myanmar from 1990 to 2017 (Figure <a href="#Fig3">3</a>).

               <p id="d1e290">The majority of Rohingya refugees have fled to Bangladesh, which directly borders
                  Myanmar. Since Bangladesh was the leading destination for the 2017 evacuation, tensions
                  rose between the Myanmar and Bangladesh governments regarding the status of Rohingya
                  refugees, who were also considered burdens and threats to the future by the Bangladesh
                  government. Diplomacy efforts have been attempted for years by the governments of
                  Myanmar, Bangladesh, and other neighbouring countries. However, they have not had
                  a significant impact on the humanitarian crisis experienced by the Ethnic Rohingya
                  [<a href="#R21">21</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e295">The majority of the international community sympathizes with the Rohingya people.
                  For instance, the UN has called the Rohingya in Myanmar, the most persecuted minority
                  in the world [<a href="#R22">22</a>]. The discrimination, violence, murder, and expulsion that have made the Ethnic Rohingya
                  stateless show that Myanmar has violated the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
                  which should apply to the entire international community without exception [<a href="#R8">8</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e303">In Indonesia, both the community and the government have jointly stated that they
                  reject the violence perpetrated by the Myanmar government that has caused this extraordinary
                  humanitarian crisis. The conflicts that occurred in 2012, 2013, 2015, and 2017 resulted
                  in many casualties in the Ethnic Rohingya group. Those who escaped death chose to
                  flee, seeking asylum and becoming refugees in Myanmar’s neighbouring countries, including
                  Bangladesh, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The emergence of refugees from Myanmar
                  has created an extensive problem and raises issues at both the national and international
                  levels. In Indonesia, the arrival of Rohingya refugees has attracted a great deal
                  of attention. The Indonesian government has the dilemma of determining its attitude
                  between deciding to accept the refugees and providing assistance to them or prohibiting
                  the Rohingya refugees from entering Indonesian territory.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e305">This struggle is evident in the responses of both the public and the government in
                  Indonesia. On the one hand, the community was aided on May 10, 2015, by the Acehnese
                  (majority Muslim), who assisted refugees floating in the ocean and enduring appalling
                  conditions. A ship carrying 582 immigrants was found stranded in waters north of Aceh,
                  and local fishermen then rescued it. The actions of the Acehnese fishermen received
                  support from the majority of the Indonesian people. However, the TNI (Indonesia National
                  Army) had the opposite reaction. On this subject, the chief of Indonesia’s national
                  army, General Moeldoko, said this: ’For the Rohingya people, when they cross the Malacca
                  Strait and experience troubles at sea such as water or food deprivation, then they
                  must be assisted. But if they enter our territory, then the TNI must protect its sovereignty’
                  [<a href="#R23">23</a>]. The government’s attitude, however, was not without reason. Apart from the attitude
                  of the TNI, who want to maintain territorial sovereignty, Indonesia also feels it
                  has no obligation to accept refugees. For instance, Indonesia was not one of the countries
                  that ratified the 1951 Refugee Status convention. In addition, economic considerations
                  and the potential for societal conflicts were the main reasons the Indonesian government
                  initially rejected Rohingya refugees [<a href="#R23">23</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e313">However, for humanitarian reasons, the majority of the Indonesian people think that
                  their nation should provide assistance, allowing these refugees to enter Indonesian
                  territory and provide them with aid and shelter. On the other hand, in May 2015, the
                  government through the TNI insisted on protecting the nation’s sovereignty by securing
                  the border and prohibiting any foreigners from entering Indonesian territory, including
                  the Rohingya refugees from Myanmar. This action of the Indonesian government triggered
                  a heated debate among the public. The majority of Indonesians and the international
                  community regretted the action taken by the Indonesian government, which initially
                  did not allow Rohingya refugees to enter the country.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e315">After holding a meeting with other countries who accept Rohingya refugees, such as
                  Malaysia and Thailand, Indonesia finally agreed to accommodate them. Nevertheless,
                  Indonesia set several prerequisites. One is that Rohingya refugees can stay temporarily
                  in camps for one year. After one year, they will be sent home if the situation allows
                  or if another country is willing to provide asylum to the Rohingya people. The handling
                  of these refugees in Indonesia has been assisted by the United Nations High Commissioner
                  For Refugees (UNHCR).
               </p>
               <p id="d1e317">The issue of human rights violations experienced by Rohingya in Myanmar has become
                  a national issue in Indonesia. The Indonesian people, who are predominantly Muslim,
                  have carried out many peaceful marches in solidarity with the Ethnic Rohingya group,
                  demanding the Myanmar government stop all forms of repression. The community has also
                  demanded that the Indonesian government actively participate in finding the best solution
                  to resolve the problem. Using humanitarian reasons, the Indonesian government has
                  tried to approach the Myanmar government to deal with the crisis together. The Indonesian
                  government offered a solution in the form of a 4 + 1 formula related to the humanitarian
                  crisis that occurred in Rakhine. The formula consists of four main points, namely
                  the following: (1) restoring stability and security, (2) maximum restraint from using
                  force, (3) protection for all people residing in Rakhine regardless of ethnicity and
                  religion, and (4) the importance of opening immediate access to humanitarian aid.
                  This formula also requires the implementation of the recommendation of the Advisory
                  Commission Report for Rakhine led by Kofi Annan, which must be conducted as soon as
                  possible [<a href="#R24">24</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e323">Several NGOs working in the field of humanity have participated in handling the humanitarian
                  crisis occurring in Myanmar. Humanitarian movements carried out by the people in Indonesia
                  have been built through the collaboration of several humanitarian NGOs in Indonesia
                  that work together with the Indonesian government it self. In addition, the Indonesian
                  government, through the Foreign Ministry, formed the Indonesian Humanitarian Alliance
                  for Myanmar (AKIM) [<a href="#R25">25</a>]. AKIM is a body formed by the Indonesian government that is a combination of 11
                  NGOs engaged in the field of humanity that have been given the mandate to provide
                  or channel aid to victims of the humanitarian crisis in Myanmar – in this case, the
                  Rohingya. All forms of assistance from the Indonesian government or the people of
                  Indonesia are channeled through AKIM.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e328">The Chief Executive of AKIM Muhammad Ali Yusuf, said AKIM is a combination of eleven
                  non-governmental organizations that have been active in humanitarian activities. He
                  added that this alliance is a form of synergy between the government and the Indonesian
                  people in helping to overcome the humanitarian crisis in Rakhine [<a href="#R26">26</a>]. The idea to establish AKIM was sparked by several NGOs that are members of the
                  Indonesian Humanitarian Forum (HFI), which is a forum for humanitarian non-governmental
                  organizations to work together in dealing with humanitarian problems. Several HFI
                  member NGOs consider that the handling of the humanitarian crisis of the Rohingya
                  ethnics will be easier to respond to if several NGOs engaged in the humanitarian sector
                  join a movement that focuses on responding to cases of Rohingya ethnicity in Myanmar.
                  The idea is then in line with the offer from the government to give full support to
                  all the efforts made by NGOs that will assist the Rohingya ethnic group in Myanmar.
                  After that, it was only agreed to establish AKIM which was the result of a collaboration
                  between several humanitarian NGOs and the Indonesian government [<a href="#R27">27</a>]. The system of working relations between AKIM and the Indonesian government is collaborative.
                  The Indonesian government only assists the lobbying process to the Myanmar government.
                  Furthermore, AKIM member NGOs, which from the beginning already had funds collected
                  from civil society donors, then distributed aid in collaboration with local NGOs from
                  Myanmar [<a href="#R27">27</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e339">The strategy used by the Indonesian government to assist victims of violence in Rakhine
                  State, Myanmar, is based on recommendations issued by the Advisory Commission on Rakhine
                  State led by Kofi Annan, which states that the International aid model for humanitarian
                  issues must be participatory and inclusive [<a href="#R28">28</a>, <a href="#R29">29</a>]. The strategy to collaborate with several NGOs in Indonesia was chosen by the Indonesian
                  government to establish a participatory and inclusive model of assistance to increase
                  community awareness about the concept of human security.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e347">Furthermore, the government established AKIM due to a blockade from the Myanmar government,
                  which hampered the Indonesian government’s attempts to assist the ethnic Rohingya.
                  The Myanmar government stipulates that the distribution of aid to ethnic Rohingya
                  should be done only with permission from the Myanmar government. However, when the
                  UN has tried to give such assistance, all aid has been rejected by the Myanmar government
                  on the grounds of unstable security. For this reason, Indonesia took a diplomatic
                  approach with the Myanmar government, and in the end, both the Indonesian government
                  was allowed to provide humanitarian aid as long as it aligned with the social institutions
                  of Myanmar. For this reason, Indonesia formed AKIM, involving humanitarian NGOs from
                  Indonesia to facilitate cooperation with NGOs in Myanmar [<a href="#R30">30</a>, <a href="#R31">31</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e355">The Indonesian government is well aware that the conflict between the Rohingyas and
                  the population in Rakhine State which thus involves the Myanmar government is an internal
                  problem for Myanmar. The Indonesian government does not have the right to interfere
                  in Myanmar’s internal affairs since it is a sovereign country. As nations that are
                  both part of ASEAN countries, Indonesia and Myanmar have their own ways of conducting
                  diplomatic relations, which must comply with the principles agreed upon by the ASEAN
                  community. In the case of resolving the humanitarian crisis experienced by the Rohingya
                  in Myanmar, the Indonesian government cannot do much to intervene, because these efforts
                  would collide with the sovereignty of the Myanmar state. ASEAN countries have agreed
                  to uphold a common fundamental principle called the ‘ASEAN Way’. This principle contains
                  provisions that ASEAN member countries must respect sovereignty and not interfere
                  in the domestic affairs of other ASEAN member countries [<a href="#R32">32</a>]. Through the ‘ ASEAN Way’, Indonesia cannot directly pressure the Myanmar government
                  in resolving its humanitarian crisis. Although the Indonesian government is constrained
                  by this mechanism, however, the country still makes efforts toward resolving this
                  ongoing humanitarian crisis. Indonesian Vice President Jusuf Kalla explained that
                  the Indonesian state is a country in which the majority of the population is Muslim,
                  so they should assist the Ethnic Rohingya groups who are victims of the conflict in
                  Myanmar. Furthermore, he affirmed that this crisis is an international humanitarian
                  problem, so there is a moral burden to help ethnic Rohingya [<a href="#R33">33</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e363">Initially, the Indonesian government paid no attention to the plight of the Rohingyas.
                  This was reflected when a wave of Rohingya refugees was barred from entering Indonesian
                  territory by the Indonesian National Army (TNI) in 2015. At that time, these refugees
                  were arriving in Indonesia by small boats, escaping from Myanmar to avoid the massacre,
                  but when they reached Indonesian waters, the TNI immediately confronted them, prohibiting
                  entry into Indonesian territory. However, fishers from the Province of Aceh, Indonesia
                  felt sympathy for the nearly dead refugees and assisted the Rohingya, offering them
                  temporary shelter in Aceh. Since then, the Indonesian people have urged the Indonesian
                  government to open the blockade and grant the Rohingya refugees permission to enter
                  Indonesian territory. Demonstrations have taken place in several regions, and the
                  community has demanded that the Indonesian government find a solution to the crisis,
                  simultaneously urging the Myanmar government to stop the slaughter of the Rohingyas
                  [<a href="#R9">9</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e368">In August 2017, there was a conflict between the Ethnic Rohingya group and the Myanmar
                  military, and hundreds of Rohingyas were attacked by Myanmar military forces. This
                  humanitarian crisis, which occurred in Rakhine, received international attention,
                  and the UN became involved, consistently providing humanitarian assistance. However,
                  when conflict broke out between the military and the Ethnic Rohingya community, the
                  Myanmar government suddenly closed access to the Ethnic Rohingya settlement. Thus,
                  all humanitarian assistance from the UN or other countries was blocked, so food supplies
                  and other daily necessities could not be distributed. This blockade resulted from
                  unstable security in the Rakhine region [<a href="#R10">10</a>]. All external parties (including the United Nations) are now prohibited from entering
                  the Rakhine region, which continues to be the primary site of conflict between the
                  military and the Ethnic Rohingya group.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e373">Being thus unable to distribute humanitarian assistance, the Indonesian government
                  took a different approach, attempting diplomacy with the Myanmar government. To this
                  end, Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Lestari Priansari Marsudi successfully met
                  with Aung San Suu Kyi and Military Commander General U Min Aung Hlaing. The Myanmar
                  government accepted only representatives of the Indonesian government, and Myanmar
                  refused to meet with envoys from any other country that wanted to similarly address
                  the humanitarian crisis in Rakhine. Even Aung San Suu Kyi was not willing to meet
                  with Malaysia’s foreign minister, Anifah Aman when both attended the ASEAN Foreign
                  Minister’s Summit. Myanmar accepts representatives of the Indonesian government because
                  the Indonesian government has used a humanitarian diplomacy approach to the crisis,
                  not discrediting the Myanmar government, which other countries have done. However,
                  the negotiations between Indonesia and Myanmar failed to open the blockade to receiving
                  outside aid for the Rohingya. Thus, Myanmar remains closed to the attempts of other
                  countries (as well as the UN) to distribute humanitarian aid. Instead, Myanmar decided
                  that aid could be channeled only through local NGOs [<a href="#R34">34</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e378">In response to this policy, the Indonesian government formed AKIM, which, again, consists
                  of 11 NGOs with the mandate to provide and channel aid by establishing cooperation
                  with NGOs in Myanmar [<a href="#R30">30</a>]. These Indonesian NGOs that comprise AKIM are listed in the following table (Table

               <p id="d1e461">AKIM has several assistance programs whose primary focus is covering the fundamental
                  needs of the Rohingya people affected by the conflict. The focuses include the fields
                  of health, education, economics, and necessary assistance. AKIM distributes aid to
                  the Ethnic Rohingya group in stages, with a grant of approximately 26 billion rupiahs.
                  All aid distributed by AKIM is not only given to Ethnic Rohingyaities in Myanmar but
                  also to Rohingya refugees who are displaced in Bangladesh [<a href="#R35">35</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e467">As an NGO, AKIM does not have the power that a state possesses. The strategy used
                  by AKIM in channeling aid to the Ethnic Rohingya group in Myanmar is different from
                  what is done by countries. However, the identity of NGOs, which is identical to that
                  of civil society, has proved more powerful and acceptable in Myanmar. Networking with
                  local NGOs is advantageous for AKIM in the process of distributing humanitarian assistance,
                  though this process is far from smooth. Obstacles faced by AKIM include poor infrastructure
                  that impedes access to the distribution of aid, rejection from residents, and challenges
                  from local authorities [<a href="#R36">36</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e472">To deal with these obstacles, AKIM and the Indonesian government have approached the
                  Myanmar government and local authorities to request permission to channel assistance.
                  In addition, AKIM also cooperates with local NGOs to facilitate the distribution of
                  aid and to make diplomacy easier for local authorities. Beyond this, AKIM always coordinates
                  with the ICRC, an international humanitarian agency with branches in Myanmar [<a href="#R35">35</a>]. Furthermore, AKIM and the ICRC approached the local community to ensure that the
                  assistance was not given to only the Ethnic Rohingya group but also to the Hindu and
                  Buddhist communities affected by the conflict in Rakhine. This would allow the local
                  community to open access to distribute assistance [<a href="#R37">37</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e480">By using the identity of NGOs and civil society movements, AKIM can enter and distribute
                  humanitarian assistance to the Ethnic Rohingya groups in Myanmar, which previously
                  could not be done by the state (including Indonesia). At that point, even the UN was
                  blocked by the Myanmar government. Despite all the aforementioned obstacles, AKIM
                  can perform a role unavailable to the state in the context of handling the humanitarian
                  crisis in Myanmar. The initial priority of AKIM was to channel humanitarian assistance
                  because the Rohingya ethical community in Myanmar desperately needed help.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e482">The work of AKIM is subject to international law developed at the Convention on the
                  Status of Refugees and the Protocol on the Status of Stateless Persons in 1951. Although
                  Indonesia has not yet ratified such regulations, the role of NGOs in handling the
                  problem of displacement was guaranteed at this Convention. At this conference, which
                  was held from 2 to 25 July 1951, several recommendations were unanimously agreed upon
                  by the participating countries. One of these, detailed in Point C, describes the involvement
                  of nongovernmental organizations considered competent to contribute to handling refugee
                  problems. This recommendation stresses that states must provide support to non-governmental
                  organizations that are committed to participating in resolving refugee problems [<a href="#R38">38</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e487">The conflict in Myanmar has caused the Ethnic Rohingya group to have experienced insecurity
                  in several fields related to the basic concept of human security. These include the
                  following seven types of security: economic, food, health, environmental, personal,
                  community, and political [<a href="#R39">39</a>]. More specifically, the poverty experienced by the Rohingya due to economic discrimination
                  has made their living conditions even worse, and the urgency of all of these threats
                  are exacerbated by shortages of food and healthcare, fundamental to human existence.
                  These conditions have led to severe malnutrition and even starvation. Obviously, all
                  of these factors have a direct impact on the health quality of the Rohingya in Myanmar
                  [<a href="#R40">40</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e495">For this reason, short-term solutions are needed to overcome urgent problems, and
                  long-term solutions must address this humanitarian problem as a whole. In the short
                  term, the work of non-governmental organizations such as AKIM has provided immediate,
                  tangible assistance to save the Rohingya from food and health crises. In the long
                  term, however, large-scale political efforts must be made by the international community,
                  both in the ASEAN region and globally, to push for more dialogue with the Myanmar
                  government. At the same time, there must be efforts to demand wider democratization
                  in Myanmar while promoting more critical awareness to avoid escalated conflict against
                  the Rohingya community. One of the problems that have occurred in Myanmar is the difficulty
                  in opening a democratic space. The military junta, which has been in power for a long
                  time, inherits an ‘‘anti-democratic’’ political character. So that awareness of human
                  rights values is difficult to develop in Myanmar. When the problem of discrimination
                  against the Rohingya ethnicity has not found a solution, the situation is made worse
                  by the military coup that took place on February 1, 2021.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e497">The leader of the National League for Democracy (NLD) party, Aung San Suu Kyi, was
                  arrested by the military. Apart from Suu Kyi, President Win Myint was also a prisoner
                  of the military. After the incident, the military then issued a statement that they
                  would rule the government and declare a state of emergency for the next year. The
                  coup was allegedly the result of the military’s dissatisfaction with the election
                  results in November 2020. They alleged that the election results were manipulative
                  and they did not want to admit it. However, the election commission and the winning
                  party (NLD) rejected the allegations and stated that the results of the November 2020
                  election were following procedures [<a href="#R41">41</a>]. With the military coup, there was a greater challenge to efforts to resolve the
                  problems faced by the Rohingya ethnic group. In this regard, the international community
                  must use all its efforts for the democratic process in Myanmar in general and the
                  settlement of the humanitarian crisis for the Rohingya ethnic group in particular.

               <!-- named anchor --></a><h2 class="main-title">5.- Conclusion</h2>
            <p id="d1e505">The Rohingya in Myanmar have experienced discrimination and deprivation of their rights.
               These violations have included acts of violence, deprivation of citizenship, and death
               from the series of conflicts that have occurred. Moreover, many have had to flee to
               various other countries to save their own lives. This human rights crisis, exacerbated
               in 2017, has attracted the attention of the international community, including the
               Indonesian state and the United Nations. As an international organization, the UN
               is trying to provide humanitarian assistance to the Ethnic Rohingya community in Myanmar,
               and similar attempts have been made by the Indonesian government. This attention from
               the international community has arisen from a sense of injustice because the Rohingya
               have been deprived of their rights as human beings.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e507">Many of these efforts to provide humanitarian assistance have been rejected by the
               Myanmar government. For security reasons, the Burmese government has been blocking
               such assistance from both neighbouring countries and the United Nations. For this
               reason, the Indonesian government formed the Indonesian Humanitarian Alliance for
               Myanmar (AKIM), which consists of 11 NGOs working in the humanitarian field. As an
               NGO itself, AKIM then networked with local NGOs in Myanmar to provide humanitarian
               assistance to the Ethnic Rohingya group. In this case, NGOs have a crucial role. Their
               impact is visibly significant, even exceeding the ability of the state, as shown by
               the efforts of AKIM toward resolving the humanitarian crisis in Myanmar.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e509">Thus, NGOs such as AKIM have been able to provide humanitarian assistance to the Ethnic
               Rohingya group, but this is only a temporary solution. The real problem is deeply
               political. The crisis is bound to structural discrimination, particularly from the
               Myanmar government, who do not recognize the Rohingya as citizens of Myanmar, even
               though history had proved that they have lived there for hundreds of years, long before
               Myanmar became an independent country. A resolution to this crisis will take more
               serious actions and significant changes, potentially involving many other countries.
               The international community must therefore exert more pressure through diplomacy and
               dialogue with the Myanmar government to be more democratic and transparent.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e511">To conclude, NGOs and the state both make important contributions to overcoming human
               rights violations. Both NGOs and the state have their respective functions, which
               ideally complement each other to restore justice in the long run. In the context of
               high politics, the state’s role is crucial, whereas accelerating human development
               and providing immediate assistance is where NGOs would play their part.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e513">There is a significant role shown by AKIM, if it is related to the Boomerang pattern
               as described by Margaret E. Keck and Kathryn Sikkink, then the phenomenon of AKIM’s
               role in responding to the humanitarian crisis that occurred in Mynamar has provided
               novelty. If the Boomerang Pattern shows a prominent role for the state and IGO, S,
               then the AKIM phenomenon shows that INGO, S, in certain conditions such as what happened
               in the handling of the humanitarian crisis for the Rohingya ethnic group in Myanmar,
               can provide a very significant role for handling it in a way quickly over the humanitarian
               crisis that occurred in Myanmar.
