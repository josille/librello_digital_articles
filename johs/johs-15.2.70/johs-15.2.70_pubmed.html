                  <p class="first" id="d1e58">With the purge of the Military Forces and the creation of a new National Civilian
                     Police (PNC) as mandated by the 1992 Peace Accords, El Salvador set the stage for
                     the construction of a less state-oriented security approach. However, a failure to
                     question issues of security and a lack of consideration of gender in the Peace negotiations
                     and the Security Reform resulted in an overly gendered understanding of security,
                     were the State remained as its subject and the practice privileged a militarized masculinity
                     that has hindered the implementation of democratic policing. In this context, 25 years
                     after the Peace Accords, the police have been unable to consolidate a democratic policing
                     practice as oppressive policing strategies remain deeply embedded in the institution,
                     side-by-side with heavy-handed measures that use repression to control social violence.
                     From a feminist critical security approach, the article questions the gendered nature
                     of security in El Salvador, and investigates the implication of the introduction of
                     militaries into the work of the police, in terms of its symbolic influence in the
                     gendered expectations of police men and women, and the practical impact it has on
                     their work, e.g., the difficulty of consolidating Community-Oriented Policing. The
                     argument is based on interviews and focus groups with police men and women, as well
                     as with feminist organizations. The information was gathered during fieldwork in 2018
                     and 2019, and through extensive literature review.

            <p id="d1e67">The greatest success of the Security Reform after the Peace Accords in El Salvador
               in 1992, together with the demobilization of the Farabundo Martí National Liberation
               Front guerrilla (FMLN, by its Spanish acronym), was the dismantling of the country’s
               old security forces. Following this, the major triumph was the creation of a new civilian
               and professional police, the National Civil Police (or PNC, by its Spanish acronym).
            </p>
            <p id="d1e69">At the start of 2017, the Salvadoran PNC celebrated the 25th anniversary of its establishment.
               Implicitly, this commemoration was also a celebration of democracy and the allegedly
               successful Security Reform. However, by the end of the same year, the police found
               itself facing a crisis of legitimacy caused by several cases of suicide, domestic
               violence, and feminicide, occurring at the heart of the institution. The country was
               shocked to learn from media coverage of the shooting and disappearance of the police
               officer Carla Ayala by another police, a member of the Police Reaction Group (or GRP,
               by its Spanish acronym), following a Christmas celebration party [<a href="#R1">1</a>].This event prompted the dismantling of the GRP, but the crisis did not end there.
               To this case a long list of accusations of impunity, abuse of power, and extrajudicial
               killings was added [<a href="#R2">2</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e77">These events were embarrassing for a police institution keen to celebrate a quarter
               of a century of existence operating under a democratic and civilian security model.
               Accusations of the police are not new. Indeed, it is connected to slowly increasing
               levels of distrust between civil society and the police, particularly to the police’s
               abuse of force, its partisan role, and lack of accountability [<a href="#R3">3</a>]. It also reflects the apparent inability of the police to guarantee public security
               under a democratic mandate in a highly violent scenario [<a href="#R4">4</a>], and moreover, their inability to protect their members from gender-based violence
               within the institution.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e85">The police are not alone in defining how security and gender relations are understood
               and performed in El Salvador. As a national institution, the Salvadorian police force
               reflects many of the assumptions of the state, the socio-cultural constructions of
               expected gender behaviors, and the myths that surround them. The police in El Salvador
               do not operate in a vacuum as they reflect the political contradictions of a post-conflict
               country with high levels of social and criminal violence. The contradictions involved
               with implementing both soft and hard security policies and practices have further
               added to the crisis of legitimacy of the PNC.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e87">Considering the wider background of this case, I aim to demonstrate in this article
               that the crisis reflects a longer history of challenges within the Salvadoran police,
               and that two major persisting difficulties rest in the understanding of gender and
               security. I argue that the crisis demonstrates the lack of a gendered approach to
               the Peace Accords and the Security Reform process. It also suggests that a limited
               understanding of security and blindness to gender, both on the political and technical
               level, has enabled the gradual militarization of the police despite the formal attempts
               of the security reform to avoid this outcome. Both difficulties have intertwined to
               actively hinder the planned police reform, specifically the implementation of democratic
               policing strategies focused on crime prevention with a communitarian approach (i.e.
               Community-Oriented Policing). While the focus of this article is unpacking the connections
               of gender and security in El Salvador, Community-Oriented Policing (COP) serves as
               an empirical example to discuss ‘How the gendered expectations of security in El Salvador
               hindered the security reform and the ongoing implementation of a democratic police?’.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e89">This article argues that the security policy is gendered and rests on expectations
               that privilege a masculine and militaristic approach. As a result, the police favor
               short-term, operative police tactics as a response to violence and criminalization
               in the country. This occurs despite the police’s simultaneous public advertisement
               of its use of integral social approaches to security and a new community-oriented
               approach to policing. This eloquent contradiction speaks of the gendered expectations
               of the security approach in El Salvador—which naturalize a masculine nature—, and
               the limits and disparities evident in the definition of the subject of security. As
               it stands, the subject of security is state-centric, thus, the focus of security is
               still engaged in the logics of the defense of the territory—a means to legitimize
               the use of force by the state.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e91">This article responds to its central question by analyzing the empirical findings
               of a six-month data collection process in El Salvador—split into two periods in 2018
               and 2019—in contrast with secondary data detailing Salvadoran security policies. The
               research was mainly carried out in San Salvador and its metropolitan area, with some
               visits to rural areas in Santa Ana and Cabañas departments. The data referred to includes
               three semi-structured interviews with senior police officers; four group-interviews
               with female and male police agents; and three semi-structure interviews with feminist
               women organizations. Unless personal names were already part of public information,
               all the names used in this research have been changed to protect the identities of
               the participants.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e93">The argument proceeds as follows, in the first section I briefly discuss why is relevant
               to discuss gender and security from a feminist approach, situating the case of El
               Salvador and drawing on a feminist-inspired discussion of the gendered and violent
               nature of Salvadorian security policy. In the second section, I argue that the state
               has adopted a masculine identity that directly affects the security policy in terms
               that privilege a male experience of security—allowing for the militarization of security.
               To illustrate this position, I briefly introduce the history of the Salvadoran police
               and the clash of interests that exists between traditional policing and COP. The third
               section illustrates how privileging masculine expectations to the police has implications
               for the involvement of women in the work of the police. It also addresses the discussion
               of how gender approaches can support a process of transformation of militarized policing
               into democratic police, with the inclusion of women’s and LGBTI people’s security
               concerns for the implementation of Community-Oriented Policing.

            <p id="d1e98">Situating this article within the context of academic and policy-driven discussions
               regarding the post-conflict (in)security in El Salvador, it has become evident that
               there is a considerable literature on the topic of policing in the country. However,
               it is also evident that there is a significant gap in this literature with regards
               to the issue of gender and human security. Most of the existing literature on the
               Salvadorian police addresses the political, social and security issues of the post-agreement
               period. The majority of literature also focuses on the Peace Accords and the immediate
               institutional adoption of democracy after the war. Mainly employing a traditional
               state-centric analysis, the discussion has focused on the implementation of the Accords,
               the lessons learned [<a href="#R5">5</a>, <a href="#R6">6</a>, <a href="#R7">7</a>]; and the difficulties that accompanied the security sector reform with a focus on
               the creation of the new police [<a href="#R8">8</a>, <a href="#R9">9</a>, <a href="#R10">10</a>].
               
            </p>
            <p id="d1e119">Studies emerging in the 1990s attempted to explain the recurrent high levels of criminality
               and the challenges to the post-conflict governments [<a href="#R11">11</a>, <a href="#R12">12</a>]. Additionally, scholarly work done in the late 1990s and early 2000s focused on
               post conflict security and channeled the discussion towards the questionable construction
               of the youth gangs as the problem of security. Influential studies discussed the gangs
               and their impact on security [<a href="#R13">13</a>, <a href="#R14">14</a>, <a href="#R15">15</a>, <a href="#R16">16</a>, <a href="#R17">17</a>, <a href="#R18">18</a>]. Other researchers focused on the responses by different governments and the politicization
               of security that followed the construction of a security narrative in El Salvador
               [<a href="#R19">19</a>, <a href="#R20">20</a>, <a href="#R21">21</a>, <a href="#R22">22</a>]. Some studies also focused on the role of the elites and the economic and political
               processes in the construction of a weak democracy and a failed state of security for
               the majority of the people [<a href="#R23">23</a>, <a href="#R24">24</a>, <a href="#R25">25</a>]. However, none of these studies directly referred to the police and policing.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e168">A second wave of research was more closely aligned with feminist concerns given its
               focus on the role of women in the post-conflict period, and specifically in the peace
               building process. It was concerned with the change of roles from being combatants
               or supporters of the revolution, to political actors and peace and development activists
               [<a href="#R26">26</a>, <a href="#R27">27</a>, <a href="#R28">28</a>]. The late post-conflict period in the early 2000s also saw the resurfacing of scholarship
               focused on women and security. This scholarship studied and discussed gender-based
               violence in the form of feminicides and criminalization of abortion in a patriarchal
               and machista society[<a href="#R29">29</a>, <a href="#R30">30</a>, <a href="#R31">31</a>, <a href="#R32">32</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e192">While there is a great deal of literature dealing with security and gender in El Salvador,
               very little research has paid attention to the intersection between gender and security.
               Even less research has specifically discussed the structural operation of the police
               and the gendered nature of security policy. This article addresses some of the gaps
               in the literature by discussing the gendered nature of the security policy in El Salvador
               from a feminist perspective, specifically by observing how the gendered nature of
               the security policy influences the implementation of new approaches to policing. The
               article aim is to contribute to a new and growing literature focusing on different
               approaches to policing that can reduce violence through prevention and community relations,
               such as Community-Oriented Policing [<a href="#R33">33</a>].

            <p id="d1e200">It is important to acknowledge how the Security Reform negotiated in the Peace Agreement
               in 1992 echoed the security discussion that was taking place in international contexts
               during 1990s, in an emergent post-cold war environment. The discussion raised a critique
               of the narrow military orientation of the realist security paradigm, suggesting a
               shift in security to include ordinary people’s concerns. Proposals were made to ‘focus
               on the individual as the subject of security’ [<a href="#R34">34</a>]; and to question the primacy of the state as the referent of security. Challenging
               the ‘national security’ approach, ‘Human Security’ emerged as a new paradigm. At its
               core, human security is concentrated on the individual and a wider spectrum of security
               threats that could happen within and outside the state. These threats include concerns
               regarding development and human rights, as a replacement to the traditional focus
               on state-centered security based on military and territorial defense [<a href="#R34">34</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e208">Furthermore, Feminist Critical Security scholars have been challenging the traditional
               equation of security with the military defense of the state [<a href="#R35">35</a>, <a href="#R36">36</a>] by inquiring about the individuals and the contexts for whom and where security
               is defined. In doing so, they connect militarized state security to women’s insecurities
               to expose the masculinity embedded in traditional security thinking [<a href="#R35">35</a>]. Feminist theories, therefore, render explicit ‘‘how gender is deeply implicated
               in the way in which particular bodies experience and execute threat and violence’’[<a href="#R35">35</a>]. In this sense, feminism invites a radical re-thinking of security to bring the
               category closer to individuals and the way everyday life is impacted by and has an
               impact on security thinking [<a href="#R36">36</a>]. Critical feminist approaches to security are then closer to a more human approach
               to security, in comparison to traditional realist approaches to security. A human
               security approach, considering its critiques, takes seriously the notion that people
               can be insecure within a secure state because the nature of their threats are different
               than those of the state; meaning that the state has the potential of becoming a threat
               to people [<a href="#R34">34</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e229">The subject within the human security approach has commonly been the person, which
               is integral to ‘citizen.’ However, the person is never neutral, and its meaning is
               embedded in the socio-cultural construction of sex, gender, class, race and political
               affiliation [<a href="#R37">37</a>]. Hence, a feminist perspective also helps to challenge the definition of the subject
               of security. Furthermore, a critical understanding of security challenges the alleged
               objectivity or subjectivity of security to connect it to a socio-cultural construction
               that creates a social order [<a href="#R38">38</a>]. Therefore, if a security approach does not address these issues, it overlooks its
               gendered and socially biased construction and omits its impact on people’s everyday
               experiences. Human security in the context of this article is understood in dialogue
               with feminist studies as an approach that rests on the person instead of the state,
               but recognizes the plurality of identities that conform the subject; remaining vigilant
               of the various possibilities where diverse ways of living can be threatened by the
               state [<a href="#R34">34</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e240">In El Salvador, feminists also challenge a traditional notion of security, by recognizing
               the different security needs of women, men, and of the LGBTQ population in the country
               within the diversity of their social mobilizations. They question how these needs
               intersect with other social characteristics such as class, race, age, disabilities,
               and occupation to understand different positions of power. Instead of further developing
               this intersectional understanding of the differentiated security needs, however, I
               argue in this article that security in El Salvador is militarized because it only
               defends the interests of the state. Therefore, by adopting and adapting a feminist
               approach, I can establish a theoretical foundation that helps to explore the impact
               of gender expectations and masculinity, in relations of power within the police and
               between the police and heterogeneous communities. Hence, this approach provides a
               way to understand violent community-police relationships and the increase in cases
               of gender-based violence (GBV) against women within the police.

            <p id="d1e245">After 12 years of intense armed conflict and the prioritization of counter-insurgency
               strategies as the state’s security policy [<a href="#R39">39</a>], in 1992 the Peace Accords and the Security Reform promised a fresh civilian beginning
               for a post-conflict nation. The security reform mandated the creation of the new National
               Civil Police (PNC), which were to receive mandatory training at a new National Academy
               of Public Security [<a href="#R40">40</a>]
            </p>
            <p id="d1e253">With the aim of creating a new civilian-police body, the Peace Accords established
               quotas for the number of ex-combatants, from both the dismantled public security forces
               and the demobilized guerilla forces members (ibid.). A ratio of 60/40 was set giving
               favor to a civilian majority, and the equal distribution of the remaining ratio between
               ex-combatants. The new police body was trained under a novel civilian security doctrine
               focused on human rights and democratic values, and in opposition to a military instruction.
               For this reason, the National Academy of Public Security (or ANSP, by its Spanish
               acronym) was created as an autonomous and civilian academic body with the responsibility
               of training and professionalizing the police focusing on the service to the community.
               Besides professionalization, the quota system supported the idea of national reconciliation
               between former enemies. This idea, however, was threatening to turn the PNC into a
               new scenario of political dispute [<a href="#R41">41</a>]. The politicization of the police can also be explained with the resistance of the
               military and the conservative political elites to its creation. This resistance, and
               subsequent acceptance of military personnel into the police, would retard the consolidation
               of its civilian and democratic mandate [<a href="#R4">4</a>, <a href="#R7">7</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e264">Security reform in El Salvador pledged to not only be humanitarian in focus, but gender
               neutral in approach. Distancing itself from a gender sensitive perspective, the security
               concerns discussed in the reform only responded to the promise of human security,
               in the sense that they re-focused the object of security to the individual. However,
               that individual, as feminist security scholars had previously critiqued, has been
               understood as neutral only to leave the question about ‘the subject matter and politics
               of security’ out of the negotiations [<a href="#R42">42</a>]. In other words, gender was not recognized as intrinsic to understanding the configuration
               of the subject of security, therefore, neither the meaning of security nor the recipient
               of that security and the context where security would take place, were questioned
               [<a href="#R35">35</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e272">Consequently, there was neither a discussion on the different gender roles performed
               by men and women during the war, nor on the social norms and expectations, including
               the differential needs and difficulties that they would encounter in the post conflict.
               From a critical feminist approach, gender neutrality could be reframed as a ‘gender
               blindness’ created by a male perspective, which reinforces gender inequalities in
               society. Therefore, without contemplating the security concerns raised by feminist
               scholars and organizations alike, it is possible to say that it lacked gender awareness
               in the definition of security and the role of the state as guarantor and architect
               of security [<a href="#R43">43</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e277">Furthermore, the discussion introduced by Critical Security Feminists that questioned
               gendered myths and assumptions associated with militarized security, connecting them
               to the marginalization of women from security and privileging men in a dominant position
               [<a href="#R44">44</a>], was ignored. Hence, women were not included in the peace negotiations despite their
               having taken an active role in the civil war, organized around the need for peace,
               and pushed for dialogue [<a href="#R27">27</a>, <a href="#R28">28</a>]. Only three high-ranking female FMLN commanders took part in the negotiations, and
               although they raised gender concerns, their participation was not as women but as
               ex-combatants [<a href="#R28">28</a>]. Hence, there is very little evidence of the impact they had inside the negotiations
               in terms of bringing gender awareness into the Peace Accords [<a href="#R45">45</a>, <a href="#R28">28</a>]. As it was reported by ‘Las Dignas’, a leading Salvadoran women’s organization,
               ‘‘there is not any reference to women either in the words nor in the spirit of the
               accords’’ [<a href="#R46">46</a>]. Therefore, in accordance to the critics from Security Feminist scholars, the reform
               did not challenge the dominant focus of security within the state whereby it has historically
               represented men’s interest and women’s subjugation [<a href="#R43">43</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e304">For the newly created police, however, the Accords gave a special consideration to
               female recruitment, but no specific quotas were established to guarantee it [<a href="#R47">47</a>]. The fact that there was no specific gender quota highlights not only the gender
               blindness in the process but also the lack of understanding of gender expectations
               in the Salvadorian society. The lack of gender awareness in the discussion failed
               to open an equal space for women in a public security institution, and no consideration
               was given to the specific-needs women had in order to access a space dominated by
               men. Thus, the fact that women participated did not change the gendered constitution
               of the institution or benefited other women in terms of the security policies, something
               reflected in the low numbers of women in the PNC. The first promotion only had 3 women
               in the highest level; 8 women in the executive level, and 11 women in the basic level,
               in comparison to 30, 65 and 260 men, respectively [<a href="#R48">48</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e312">It is widely understood that giving attention to gender is not limited to the recognition
               of women [<a href="#R44">44</a>]. Giving attention to gender in the Salvadorian context is acknowledging that the
               failure to reflect on the different gender experiences during the war neglected the
               recognition of gendered power imbalances, and failed to interrogate about who is or
               should be the subject of security [<a href="#R49">49</a>].The resulting ‘gender blindness’ in the Peace Agreements became another form to
               naturalize a male perspective [<a href="#R28">28</a>], which justified a state-centric discourse and a traditional masculine-driven security
               approach [<a href="#R35">35</a>, <a href="#R36">36</a>] to deal with the new post-conflict context. Bringing a Feminist critique to a Salvadorian
               gender awareness should then ‘‘delegitimize discriminatory practices and institutions
               as socio-historical constructions and ‘repoliticize’ orthodox views on security by
               challenging the role of the state as provider of security’’ [<a href="#R42">42</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e333">Feminist critiques of discriminatory practices based on gender, such as the division
               of the public-private space, and the visibility of the state as a male-constructed
               institution, is a way to bring attention to the politics at play in the construction
               of security in El Salvador. The gendered nature of the security policy is a representation
               of the politicization of security in its masculine approach, which is performed through
               increased militarization, limiting its definition.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e335">Because the definition of security is gendered, so are the institutions for security
               provision; this is to say that the practice of security is gendered. As it stands,
               security in El Salvador is not neutral and mostly focuses on public spaces. Thus,
               despite the introduction of gender and COP philosophy into the work of the police,
               the implementation of security by the police in El Salvador is dependent on political
               agendas that seem to prioritize a masculine perspective on security by privileging
               the use of militaries over the introduction of more civilian and communitarian approaches
               to security.

            <p id="d1e340">Security has been at the center of public attention since the end of the war. Amplified
               by media outlets, the high homicide levels and the social unrest have come to justify
               the introduction of immediate responses to security. This includes highly repressive
               measures such as massive detentions or the intensification of military and police
               presence in the territory [<a href="#R50">50</a>], in detriment of more integral approaches to reduce violence. Nevertheless, from
               a critical perspective, the increase in security measures during the last 25 years
               has not been successful in reducing the homicide level in the country or in addressing
               the security needs of all the population.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e345">The popularity of repressive security strategies has its origin in the securitization
               of the social problems that affected the country after the war. The increased militarization
               is rooted in the influence the armed forces have in the definition of the security
               agenda, even after the security reform took place. The Salvadorian political elite
               purposely created the discursive conditions justifying war-like responses i.e. the
               creation of a new enemy, and the re-introduction of a war-like paradigm of security
               to combat the enemy. In this context, it proved to be easy to justify immediate responses,
               even those using violent means, to a society that was long used to violence and tired
               of insecurity [<a href="#R21">21</a>]. The military was once more brought into the public security sphere.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e350">The dichotomous military and civilian expectations within the PNC in El Salvador,
               are explained in terms of the military/ guerrilla and civilian quota structure and
               the bricolage style of the initial police training. According to high-ranking police
               officers interviewed in the Metropolitan area of San Salvador, the quota system that
               fractured the police into political alliances and allowed the military to retain their
               influence in the new police became a weakness of the PNC, and what could be named
               as its ‘original sin,’ [<a href="#R4">4</a>]. In addition to the military influence within the police, the fact that the PNC
               was initially trained based on different police models hampered it from building its
               own police model and fully integrating the mandate of the Peace Accords in its practice.
               Therefore, the struggle between a military and a civilian approach in the police is
               also explained in terms of the training the PNC received in its forming stages under
               the ONUSAL mandate, as various countries with different policing models influenced
               the constitution of the new police. The two most influential training models came
               from Spain, the United States (Puerto Rico), and Chile, which from 1992–1994 oversaw
               the ‘Police Intervention’ training program. Each of them brought their own approaches
               to policing [<a href="#R51">51</a>]. In an interview with a high-ranking police officer in San Salvador, he mentioned
               that the National Police Body of Spain focused their training towards a democratic
               and civilian practice, while the Carabineers of Chile and the Puerto Rican Police,
               which had a military police structure, focused more on discipline and order.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e358">It does not come as a surprise that this diversity of approaches to policing enriched
               the new police’s identity, as much as it negatively affected the implementation of
               a locally owned approach to the specific Salvadorian context. This became a limitation
               when the police landed in the middle of political interests that reflected these two
               different police training models, allowing for the increasing involvement of the military
               in public security. This has been a major difficulty for the PNC, as it will be explained
               below.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e360">From a feminist perspective, to paraphrase Laura Sjøberg, militarism is the introduction
               of a war-related mindset and activities outside of war-contexts into social and political
               life [<a href="#R52">52</a>]. The introduction of war-contexts is what justified the militarization of the security
               in El Salvador. According to Jeannette Aguilar [<a href="#R4">4</a>], the role of the military in the internal security has three main periods.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e368">The first period is 1992-2002 i.e. the years after the Peace Accords. During this
               time, the governing party took advantage of the social instability of the postwar
               to reformulate the security discourse in the country. Because of a lack of personnel
               in the new PNC, members of the military were introduced into the patrolling work of
               the police but under the guidelines of the PNC [<a href="#R4">4</a>].
               
            </p>
            <p id="d1e373">The second period is 2003–2006 and the implementation of Mano Dura (Iron Fist) and,
               subsequently, Super Mano Dura security policies. This period initiated the ‘War on
               Gangs’, and successfully reversed the focus of security from the citizens to the state,
               identifying youth gangs as an issue of supreme priority for the security of the country
               [<a href="#R17">17</a>, <a href="#R20">20</a>, <a href="#R53">53</a>, <a href="#R54">54</a>]. As Josefina Echavarría explains [<a href="#R49">49</a>], the consequence of a state-centered security is that when the object of security
               is self-reflected and remains unquestioned, its capacity to map social insecurities
               is limited. Therefore, everything becomes a security concern [<a href="#R49">49</a>]. In El Salvador, the recycling of war paradigms of security and the notion of a
               ‘public enemy’ were reintroduced as ways to justify military intervention in public
               security. Furthermore, according to Aguilar [<a href="#R4">4</a>] the impact of these years of intense militarization of the police was a process
               of denaturalization and internal decomposition. The use of violence permeated the
               inner fibers of the police. Indeed, even after the Super Mano Dura plan was officially
               over, the abusive practices and excessive use of force and violence remained in the
               police subculture [<a href="#R4">4</a>]. The police continued to target young poor and marginalized men, resulting in a
               backlash that led to the strengthening of the gangs and their mutation into more organized
               forms of delinquency [<a href="#R4">4</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e403">From a feminist critical perspective, this securitization could be labelled as a ‘masculinist-security
               paradox’, because it aims to repress violent masculinities by legitimizing state-supported
               masculine display of violence through the militarization of public security. The success
               of securitization in El Salvador has resulted in the introduction of militarism as
               a justifiable approach to public matters of security that are civilian by definition,
               which blurs the distinctions between war and peace, military and civilian [<a href="#R52">52</a>]. While suggesting that insecurity has its roots in the use of violence by other
               groups different to the state, securitization has created a war-like scenario that
               renders invisible the socio-economic problems of the population and the political
               intentions of those in power. This blurry distinction between military and civilian
               is problematic on many levels. For the purpose of the implementation of community-oriented
               policing, a war-like logic becomes especially problematic when defining the role of
               the community in the process, as the community could be labelled either as a possible
               ‘enemy’ or as a potential ‘informant’. This approach does not break damaging stereotypes,
               nor does it allow the police to strive to understand the social positionality of each
               community. Moreover, it limits the understanding of COP and its potential for social
               transformation.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e408">The change of government in 2009 brought a change of political discourse and initiated
               a new third period of development from 2009 until 2014 [<a href="#R4">4</a>]. It encouraged the PNC to go through changes that challenged earlier militarist
               and macho practices. In this period, the COP model was formally adopted and a Gender
               Unit was established, yet these changes did not translate into a change to security
               practices. Aguilar terms this period as one of ‘militarization by decree’ [<a href="#R4">4</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e416">During this period, the executive sanctioned seven decrees, and the legislative sanctioned
               one, extending the participation of the military in different roles concerning public
               security. Consequently, militarization became the de facto security policy implemented
               by the FMLN administration, irrespective of the proposed strategic and inclusive approach
               to decriminalization [<a href="#R55">55</a>]. During this time the military increased their role in public security, removing
               the barriers put in place by the Peace Accords to limit the direction of policing
               to civilian authorities. For instance, Brigadier General Francisco Salinas was appointed
               as the Director of the Police in 2012, replacing Commissioner Carlos Ascencio who
               had a COP approach. This was done based on the argument that delinquency was at a
               level beyond the capacities of the civilian police [<a href="#R4">4</a>]. Nevertheless, COP was officially implemented by the time Brigadier General Salinas
               was appointed, thus his position as the PNC’s general director did not stop the introduction
               of COP but did hinder its implementation.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e425">It can be said that as security reform directly places powerful interests into question,
               it is as much a political process as it is a police-technical one [<a href="#R41">41</a>]. It is for this reason that it took the PNC almost 20 years to formally embrace
               its communitarian mandate, and to recognize the different experiences of women and
               men within the police, as well as to implement gender policies for the institution.

            <p id="d1e433">In his opening speech in 2009, Commissioner Carlos Ascencio—the appointed police director
               at the beginning of the FMLN presidential period—, called for a re-evaluation of the
               police’s development. He argued that strengthening the police as an institution required
               an institutional self-critique of the initial conception of the police in close relation
               to the community, and proposed the introduction of an integral approach to security
               that prioritized preventive measures and community-oriented practices [<a href="#R56">56</a>]. Community-Oriented Policing (COP) is understood as a transversal policing philosophy
               that prioritizes the community in the processes of identification and solution of
               problems, as well as in the evaluation of the police work [<a href="#R57">57</a>]. Since then, COP has been mainstreamed into the PNC first as a philosophy of policing,
               and more recently as a strategy and a policing model.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e441">The first attempt to implement community policing was through the Community Police
               Intervention Patrols (PIP-COM, by its Spanish acronym), which were created during
               the Francisco Flores administration (1999–2004) and within the framework of the Alliance
               for Security. These patrols received funding and technical guidance from the US Department
               of Justice’s Criminal Investigative Training Assistance Program (ICITAP).
            </p>
            <p id="d1e443">Commissioner Hugo Ramirez, former sub-director of Public Security (until 2019), was
               the first to implement a PIP-COM in Zacamil, Mejicanos. According to him, the model
               aimed at effective patrolling to offer responses to crimes affecting communities such
               as drug dealing and robberies. The PIP-COM sought to reduce crime through planned
               preventative-dissuasive patrolling, quick response times, community integration and
               consultation. This approach was novel in that the patrolling was done by foot, bicycles,
               or by car in groups of four agents, with the intention that the police agents had
               more chances to be involved with the community. The plan was to gradually implement
               this program and expand it to the rest of the country. However, due to insufficient
               funding as well as limited follow up and monitoring, it was unable to establish itself
               firmly enough to take root in the work methodology that had inspired it.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e445">In a 2018 interview with Hilda, a middle-ranking police woman, she explained that
               when she started working with the police, the PIP-Com’s model was already established.
               Hilda commented that these ended up becoming more akin to intervention patrols than
               community policing: ‘‘they were more PIP than Com’’. This overemphasis on intervention
               patrolling policing, the PIP part of it according to Hilda, can be explained by the
               first period of justified militarization of the police [<a href="#R4">4</a>]. Despite being classified as ‘a failure,’ because of a lack of institutional support
               and a clear communitarian strategy that turned the PIP-COMs into repressive groups
               [<a href="#R58">58</a>], this format remains active in El Salvador, performing duties very similar to those
               described at its origins. Nevertheless, more serious steps toward a community-based
               model began in 2006, when the Department of Community Relations was made a Secretariat
               with greater authority to design and execute policies. Under that Secretariat, the
               Community Police Unit began the task of systemization with support from the ANSP,
               which concentrated on drafting the Experimental Manual on Community Policing.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e453">The current COP model has been strongly supported on a technical level by the Japanese
               Development Agency, JICA, since 2011 until today. The terms of their support include
               the drafting of the Manual on Community Policing, the construction of COP bases, and
               the exchange with members of the Military Police of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The Police
               Pacification Units (UPP, in Portuguese), became a source of inspiration for the implementation
               of repressive tactics vis-à-vis the establishment of COP, especially in areas with
               high presence of gangs where the territory was disputed.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e455">The UPP is a tropicalization—and one could say a militarization—of the Japanese Koban
               model, where communitarian-security bases are placed in local communities. In Rio
               and Sao Paulo, this model was implemented by the Military Police to ‘clean’ favelas
               of drug traffickers and gangs, enforcing law into these areas with military strategies,
               to be able to introduce a new communitarian police base in the intervened areas [<a href="#R59">59</a>]. According to Commissioner Ramirez, the UPP’s failed because of lack of sustainability
               of the model. First, because the police was the only institution in areas abandoned
               by the state, resulting in the UPP’s model of first enforcing law, then setting up
               preventive programs with a communitarian approach, and leaving afterwards did not
               stabilize the areas or made a security project sustainable. Second, as their preventive
               programs with the community were not state-led but sporadically sponsored by private
               companies, they lacked economic sustainability. In this sense, according to Commissioner
               Ramirez, the Salvadorian model has exceeded the UPP and learned from its failures.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e460">The Salvadorian police domesticated the tropicalization of the COP model done by the
               Brazilian Military Police, by implementing it as a strategy to dismantle the gang
               control over certain territories. Commissioner Ramirez expressed that COP in El Salvador
               has been projected differently, being more integral and long-term. Nevertheless, other
               voices from the police criticize the instrumental role assigned to COP and claim that
               there is still little understanding of community policing. Early in 2019, Pedro, a
               mid-ranking police officer in San Salvador, stated in an interview that COP in El
               Salvador is more ambitious in comparison to its implementation in Brazil, because
               the PNC works with a COP philosophy on a national level. There is, however, a need
               to evaluate whether the methodology and the strategy have been adequate. This is because,according
               to him, ‘‘a short-sighted culture has taught us to not look beyond but to react to
               situations, jamming us (in the PNC) to the delinquent problem and not allowing us
               to even do effective investigations. And this is also because a whole social phenomenon
               has been charged to the police’’.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e462">Nevertheless, COP was introduced after two periods of militarization, meaning that
               the already fragile police force’s civil practice has been under military influence
               for more than a decade, privileging a violent masculine expectation on the practice
               of policing. Moreover, the construction of gangs as a security concern that needed
               to be contended by means of heavy-handed measures, was already deeply implanted in
               the mentality of the people. Within the police, it worked to continue the war-notion
               of the ‘enemy,’ making it difficult to transform with a communitarian approach.

               <!-- named anchor --></a><h2 class="main-title">7.- COP: Rambo vs. Sissy Police</h2>
            <p id="d1e467">Pedro, the mid-ranking officer in San Salvador, also argues that there is a cultural
               resistance to the COP model within the police, and a misconception of the mission
               of the police as an institution, and the role of the police as an agent. According
               to him, the Salvadorian Constitution defines the mission of the PNC is to prevent
               and repress crime. However, many in the police perceive that their mission is mainly
               to enforce the law and repress crime. Pedro claims that the average police agent perceives
               his role as being based on a ‘‘Rambo’’ prototype created by Hollywood movies, where
               the police agent is always either capturing or fighting crime, but not working on
               prevention. Prevention and particularly COP are associated with ‘‘soft’’ and ‘‘gentle’’
               characteristics. In other words, they are seen as ‘sissy policing’. This reference
               to supposed effeminate behavior genders the use of violence within the police and
               the perception police agents have of their role.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e469">The Salvadorian police commonly state that people in El Salvador are violent. This
               is often followed with the statement ‘‘it is difficult for the police to respect all
               the human rights of all the people’ because ‘one cannot be blandito (soft)’’. Supporting
               Pedro’s statement, being soft in their eyes is a synonym of being weak. Dominant masculinities
               are not weak, or at least the projection of masculinity is not weak. From a masculinity
               studies perspective Kimmel states, ‘‘manhood is about defense against humiliation’’
               [<a href="#R60">60</a>]. For that reason, for the police agents the use of force is not only necessary but
               encouraged among each other when they start working in the streets. Furthermore, Connell
               argues that violence is an important element in the political structure of gender
               between men [<a href="#R61">61</a>]. Therefore, violence or force can be used to reclaim masculinity within group struggles.
               In a social decomposition process violence is used as a form of dominance that is
               imperfect because it is not legitimate. In the case of the police, the filtrated military
               logics fractured the fragile new civilian approach, and naturalized the need to prove
               the use of force and violence as a masculine faculty in a context of social and economic
               emasculation [<a href="#R62">62</a>]. The same logic, however, thrives within gangs as violence is used as an expression
               of power and identity [<a href="#R15">15</a>, <a href="#R20">20</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e486">With this expectation of masculinity, COP is rendered as soft policing. Therefore,
               many police officers are of the opinion that community policing is an additional conceptual
               approach to policing that can be omitted once graduated from the ANSP, because it
               is not the ‘proper’ way of policing the Salvadorian streets. As different police agents
               stated in informal discussions and group interviews, ‘what you learn in the academy
               is theoretical and there is no use for it in the streets.’ Hence, from their perspectives
               the implementation of COP is supplementary to existing repressive strategies. According
               to Pedro, the filtration of the military in security and the lack of implementation
               of COP relate to state institutional weakness, which the FMLN administration aimed
               to overcome by strengthening the public security body. For Pedro, this demonstrates
               that there is a limited understanding of security and its practice by the police.
               For this police officer, the methods implemented in the attempts to strengthen the
               State’s capacity have been counter-productive to the COP model as they focus on repressive
               strategies that can provide speedy results by weakening delinquent structures and
               ‘re-gaining’ control of the territory.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e488">An example of military strengthening of the public security practice to overcome the
               state’s institutional weakness, can be seen in the ‘swept and COP’ strategy, institutionalized
               since April 2018 by the administration of Sanchez Cerén as ‘Plan 10.’ This plan’s
               focus is on the reduction of delinquency, and the control of the territory, with more
               presence of PNC in urban areas, and the conjoint work of PNC and Armed Forces in the
               rural areas [<a href="#R63">63</a>]. In this plan, Community-Oriented Policing has been instrumental to promote the
               perception of policing practices that are done in consultation with the community
               while, nonetheless, the practice is based on military action, inspired in the Brazilian
               UPPs. Hence, in this plan COP strategies have been introduced in High Delinquent Incidence
               Sectors (SAID, in Spanish), as stabilizers of security after special security forces
               have ‘swept’ the area from gang members.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e493">The paradoxical relationship between institutional weakness and a limited understanding
               of security, as previously pointed by Pedro, can be explained if security is understood
               as a public good that is provided by the state. Then, the weakness of the state contributes
               to the gradual erosion of this understanding of security [<a href="#R64">64</a>]. Therefore, if the state is weak, there are fewer expectations on what it can do
               to transform the situation of violence; there is also less accountability, and a pressure
               for short-term results, which justify shock tactic approaches. For Pedro, this is
               a logic of ‘cleaning the ground’ that translates to the deployment of special security
               forces rather than community-oriented policing into violent contexts. From his point
               of view, this perspective limits the role of the police in the fulfillment of their
               mission, as the police is merely understood as a crime repressor instead of a service-oriented
               agent; reproducing the Rambo-like mentality that gives more value to operative shock
               strategies than to community-oriented strategies. There is a direct relation between
               the implementation of security practices and the definition of security by the state.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e498">The ‘Plan 10’ security plan falls into this logic that Pedro critiques, as it is targeting
               mainly socio-economically disadvantaged communities with high levels of delinquency,
               with the intention to ‘clean’ the area of delinquency and gang structures. This strategy
               seems to be based on an unsustainability Rambo mentality, and is problematic for several
               reasons. The first and most obvious is the notion of ‘cleaning’ a community, in order
               to offer speedy security results, which replicates a war-like logic of the ‘internal
               enemy’ [<a href="#R37">37</a>], based on the notion that communities can be cleaned from unwanted individuals.
               This is problematic not only because it constructs categories of ‘lives that matter,’
               but because it also ignores the socio-economic context and the conditions that allowed
               for the consolidation of delinquency and gangs in the territory. Second, the idea
               of introducing COP to stabilize an area with the intention to evacuate after it is
               ‘stable’ is taking advantage of the communities. Since this security intervention
               does not address the social problematics affecting the communities, it is exploiting
               their needs to adapt and survive, and the trust mechanisms developed between community
               and police members. These social problematics should be addressed by other state institutions
               different from the police, for that reason it is questionable that the state pretends
               to ‘stabilize’ the conditions of these communities exclusively through the sporadic
               presence of the police.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e503">Furthermore, this plan clearly differentiates the two policing styles in the country
               but also merges them together to make military approaches to public security appear
               sustainable. However, the sustainability of this plan depends on the sustainability
               of COP in the territories. Nevertheless, when the whole COP approach is not taken
               seriously by the PNC itself, and depends on the willingness of the local police members,
               this sustainability is hindered by the same plan’s short-term design.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e505">On a field visit to a rural community in the department of Cabañas, in March 2018,
               it was apparent how fragile COP can be when its role in a short-term security plan
               is merely instrumental. According to community representatives, the community used
               to be peaceful until it saw a spiral of violence in 2017 initiated by gang’s territorial
               dispute, causing displacement of many families and young people to Mexico and the
               United States, as well as many homicides of members of the community. The police came
               with shock tactics in an open confrontation with gang members, and many were killed,
               and others were sentenced to prison. After this intervention, a new police group was
               sent to the community. This time it was the rural police’s turn—equipped with rifles
               and a community-oriented discourse—, to stabilize the situation and built trust relationships
               with the community. According to Giovanny, a police agent in charge of the sector,
               building trust-relationships with the community was very difficult at the beginning.
               They tried to follow the script and go door-to-door around the community, explaining
               their job and getting information from the people. It did not work as planned; people
               were afraid of them and distrusted them. Instead, these police agents saw an opportunity
               to interact with members of the community elsewhere. In this case, trust had to be
               built away from the ‘typical’ security discourse; in this case, the football field
               became the place where the police showed the community they could be trusted.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e507">The rural police earned the trust of the children and youth that used the field by
               guarding their games and supporting their tournaments, eventually earning their parents
               trust and having a snowball effect within the rest of the community. This trust, according
               to the community representatives, was possible because the police stayed in the community
               and got to know the people that lived there, especially the youth. Now that the plan
               is over and the place is safer, the community fears the withdrawal of the rural-police
               and the ‘sporadic’ patrol done by new police who do not know the needs of the community.
               The community believes that once the rural police is removed, the youth will be targeted
               again, and crime will return amidst rampant social insecurity. In these contexts,
               a COP strategy can only be sustainable if it takes part of a long-term plan that includes
               the community, and not just of a short-term approach to mask military action under
               the effectivity of community-policing.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e509">Nevertheless, securitization and militarization have been planted deeply into the
               security logics of the country, despite the change of administrations and political
               discourse. Consequently, despite the spread of COP, Martínez [<a href="#R54">54</a>] has claimed that Sanchez Cerén ‘‘launched the most violent and murderous repressive
               strategy that El Salvador has seen this century’’. Since 2016, the Sanchez Cerén administration
               launched the program Extraordinary Security Measures to crack down on the gangs, focusing
               on restrictions in the prison system, legal reforms to the criminal procedure code,
               among others, and again, militarization. By normalizing the military inherence in
               the internal security and their operative support to the police, this administration
               embraced a strategy of open war against the gangs, further justifying the use of lethal
               force [<a href="#R65">65</a>].
               
            </p>
            <p id="d1e518">Following this logic, communities with higher levels of criminal violence and torn
               social fabric, but not prioritized as the SAID, often do not have the presence of
               community policing units and only interact with militarized units. These units mistreat
               them to the extent that women from a rural community in central El Salvador suggest
               that ‘‘there is more fear towards them (the police) than the boys (gangs)’’. For those
               communities who have a presence of police that actively approaches them, the police
               represent a threat and jeopardize their security within their communities as it flags
               them as collaborators with the police. Hilda, the mid-ranking police woman, also reflected
               on this situation in one of our interviews, discussing how problematic the heavy-handed
               measures were for the community-police relationship. ‘‘When the gangs began, instead
               of looking for real causes and looking for alternatives that really accounted for
               the phenomenon, more repressive and harder measures were adopted. (…) You could not
               see anyone on the street because we did take them all to jail. (…) Then, when we wanted
               to get closer to the community and see what we could do, many communities did not
               want the police to come. They were vulnerable’’. In these cases, people do not trust
               the police because in their everyday reality, encounters with the police are marked
               by fear and repression. Therefore, understand the community policing philosophy not
               as a concrete effort of the police, but as an instrumental discourse to get close
               to the community during the day, extract information, and repress them at night with
               special units.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e520">As Cynthia Enloe expresses it, ‘‘militarization occurs because some people’s fears
               are allowed to be heard, while other people’s fear are trivialized and silenced’’
               [<a href="#R66">66</a>]. In masculine driven societies, such as El Salvador, men feel constant pressure
               to prove their manhood by means of aggression; thus, the introduction of a military
               mindset in the police has, for example, legitimated the use of violence as a successful
               proof of masculinity. Following the use of the military-police special forces, in
               comparison to 2015, when El Salvador gained the infamous title of being the most violent
               country not at war in the world, with a homicide rate of 104 per 100,000 inhabitants,
               the homicide rate in 2016 was reduced to 81.2 per 100,000 inhabitants, to 60 in 2017,
               and 51 per 100,000 in 2018 [<a href="#R67">67</a>]. Although these numbers are still considered to be epidemic by the World Health
               Organization, the administration of Sánchez Cerén proudly highlighted the decrease
               in homicides, calling for the successful implementation of the security strategies.
               In parallel, a strategic silence was kept about the increase in the abuse of force
               by the police and the numerous cases of extra-judicial killings of alleged gang members
               by Special Security commands within the PNC [<a href="#R68">68</a>, <a href="#R69">69</a>], the increase in the killings of women [<a href="#R70">70</a>], and members of the LGBT community [<a href="#R71">71</a>]. So far, there seems to be a correlation between the reduction of homicides, the
               increase in extra-judicial killings, the increase in gender-based violence, and violent-militarized
               masculinities.

            <p id="d1e544">It is possible to assert that the State operates with a notion of security that is
               masculinist. This gives higher visibility to ‘public’ security concerns, while it
               remains silent around other forms of insecurity and violence caused by accepted definitions
               of masculinity. In an attempt to bring public awareness to other forms of violence
               affecting women, feminist and women’s organizations point to the high levels of <i>feminicidios</i> (femicide) [<a href="#R72">72</a>] The number of feminicides makes El Salvador one of the most dangerous countries
               in the world for women. Women’s organizations hold the state for being partially responsible
               for the impunity shown towards the perpetrators of the 1,518 cases of feminicide reported
               from January 2015 to June 2017 [<a href="#R73">73</a>]. <i>Feminicide</i>, or the killing of a women based on gender, became a crime in the Salvadoran jurisprudence
               with the introduction of the LEIV (Special Law for a Life Free from Violence for Women)
               in January 2012. Despite the creation of the new law, most of these killings have
               been categorised by the police as homicides. The designation of a killing as a feminicide
               is only made possible once the investigation has confirmed that women had been killed
               because of their gender, and rulings on this are dependent on the investigation of
               the crime and the interpretation from the judge.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e558">The problem of impunity is made further visible in the high number of women killed
               in El Salvador i.e. 13,49 for every 100,000 in 2017 according to data from the PNC
               [<a href="#R74">74</a>]. Compared to 2017, with 471 <i>feminicidios</i>, 2018 saw a 20% reduction in the killings of women and, according to the PNC, there
               were 381 feminicides. According to the information gathered by the women’s organization
               ORMUSA, many of these cases happened in the private sphere or in locations that are
               familiar to the victim [<a href="#R75">75</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e569">According to women organizations, there are also cases were women have been kidnapped
               by organized crime. However, there is has been a very poor record kept by the police
               with regards to the registration of reports of these kind [<a href="#R76">76</a>]. According to a representative from the women organization Las Dignas, ‘‘women do
               not have major protection from anyone,’’ the police and the military, as well as the
               gangs, threaten them. However, this experience is not reflected in the public narrative,
               in which there is no discussion about women being perceived as sexual objects or suffering
               from sexual harassment, sexual violations, and feminicide.
               In further discussions with other members of Las Dignas, amongst women, there are
               socially invisible groups, such as lesbians, which suffer discrimination in society.
               This is reflected in their difficulties to access health services, and experiences
               of lack of respect and harassment from security forces. The Trans-community also reports
               high levels of impunity in connection with the hate crimes perpetrated against them
               since 1990. These are calculated by LGBT Human Rights Organizations to be as high
               as 600 [<a href="#R77">77</a>]. These organizations, such as COMCAVIS, and ASPIDH-ARCOIRIS, state that gang members
               and the police threaten transgender people; while the gangs use them as carriers of
               illegal activities, the police criminalize them based on this stereotype [<a href="#R78">78</a>]. There is also structural violence. Without state recognition as a gender specific
               group trans people find it difficult to access social services.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e580">Challenging the public security narrative takes us to question the silence around
               gender in connection to the differentiated impact lethal violence has on different
               bodies. Therefore, men being killed by other men, in connection to criminality or
               the ‘war against gangs’, has been normalized in the public narrative, while women
               and other gender minorities’ deaths, whom are mainly killed because of their gender
               identity or their gender expression, remains accepted but invisible. These gender-based
               crimes, taking the form of <i>feminicides</i> and <i>transfeminicides</i>, are supported by the patriarchal construction of ownership of female bodies and
               a need to reaffirm masculinity by attacking those that do not comply with a hetero-normative
               model [<a href="#R79">79</a>]. This has a twofold effect. On the one hand, it hides the gendered dimensions of
               violence, downplaying non-normative expressions of violence—such as domestic forms
               of violence and violence against women and girls, or hate crimes—from the public sphere,
               thus locating them in the private sphere and not challenging the silence around them.
               In addition, by only focusing on violence against women as a gendered type of violence
               it perpetuates the notion that men are not gendered, masking the impacts of a masculinist
               approach to violence, mainly in its militarized form and the securitization of the
               public agenda.

               <!-- named anchor --></a><h2 class="main-title">9.- Gender Awareness in the Police</h2>
            <p id="d1e594">Women and LGBTI organizations have lobbied for laws or protocols that recognize their
               specific security concerns and ways to protect them from violence. In 2010 the LEIV
               was sanctioned. This law acknowledges seven different forms of violence that affect
               women in the everyday life and that remain invisible to the public eye. These are
               economic violence, feminicide violence, physical violence, emotional and psychological
               violence, patrimonial violence, sexual violence, and symbolic violence [<a href="#R80">80</a>]. LGBTI organizations, on their part, have lobbied for protocols against discrimination
               and for inclusion. The Executive Decree No. 56 to reduce discrimination against LGBTI
               population was sanctioned in 2010, and the Attention Policy for the LGBTI Population
               was sanctioned in 2018. Still, these bureaucratic measurements have had little ripple
               effect on the everyday police agent in terms of challenging masculine, misogynistic,
               and hetero-normative ideas. Reports suggest that the police are recognized as violators
               of the human rights of women and LGBT people, particularly trans women [<a href="#R31">31</a>, <a href="#R71">71</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e605">Responding to a new political ideology and the pressure from feminist and LGBTI Organizations,
               in 2009 there was a presidential mandate to incorporate gender diversity and vulnerable
               groups into the work of the police. The creation of a Gender Unit and a Gender Equity
               and Equality Policy were implemented as part of the Institutional Strategic Plan of
               the police for 2011-2021. Furthermore, the article 25 of the LEIV stipulates the creation
               of institutional units for assisting women victims of violence. Following this mandate,
               the PNC established Special Womens’ Units for Support and Attention, which specialized
               in gender-based violence against women. The units were organized under the Office
               for Reporting and Attention to Civilians (UNIMUJER-ODAC in Spanish). The intention
               of these units is to provide a separate, comfortable and safe space for women to denounce
               crime and abuse without being re-victimized. These units also represented the possibility
               of offering a differential approach to women’s insecurities, including transgender
               women. However, this inclusion depends on the informed discretion of the personnel
               from each unit, as the LEIV does not directly include trans-women but other protocols
               sanction discriminatory actions by state institutions.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e607">The creation of special units for women have proved to be an important opportunity
               to create a trust relationship between the police and the women from the communities,
               because (as women organizations warn) ‘community is not a synonym of women’ [<a href="#R81">81</a>], and spaces with a differential approach are welcome in different communities. There
               are examples, one comes from the community of Texistepeque, where one female police
               agent has developed ‘a good COP practice’, according to the PNC, by evaluating the
               conditions of the community and offering alternatives to mitigate social risks. In
               this case, agent Ana Maria saw that the lack of income-generating activities in a
               shrinking agricultural economy was a risk for both for males and females of the community,
               that needed to be addressed. Therefore, in dialogue with the community and with the
               support of the PNC, she organized training courses to offer women and men in the community
               professional skills they could use to be economically independent. Through these courses
               and her interest in the social conditions of the community, the agent began to be
               more involved in the everyday concerns of the community, and the community began to
               organize themselves more. In the everyday involvement trust relationships were consolidated,
               allowing the police to map other insecurities that were elusive before, such as economic
               and social insecurities related to the lack of jobs in the area. As well as cases
               of sexual or domestic violence, drug dealing, and gang related threats to members
               of the community. This example addresses differential security concerns of the community
               that go beyond the traditional police approach but gets closer to a broader definition
               of security that prioritizes the community.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e612">The police, however, still have difficulty understanding the complex position of women
               in the communities. Women, including trans-women, are vulnerable to violence in areas
               controlled by gangs for different reasons. Some of those are related to being family
               members, friends, or neighbors of gang members [<a href="#R31">31</a>]. In discussions with young women living in gang-controlled areas, they expressed
               a constant fear of being kidnapped, raped or killed by the gang members. As the coordinator
               of ORMUSA’s Violence against Women’s program highlights, ‘‘women live in a mortal
               duality’’, as whatever they do, in terms of denouncing, informing, or resisting/ tolerating
               violence, is perceived as double betrayal to the gang and to the police. Therefore,
               many of these women are in a difficult position that reflects the power tensions in
               the community between the police and the gangs. In these cases, the social control
               operated by the gang impact the legal power attributed to the police and its faculty
               for public security. Therefore, in some cases the UNIMUJER-ODAC’s capacity to register
               cases and map the specific insecurities of women in some communities has weakened
               because of the security risks affecting women and their families if they contact the
               police. Besides these risks, fieldwork shows there is a general mistrust in the judicial
               system, characterized by impunity, especially when a victim is a woman or member of
               the LGBT community and comes from a low socio-economic class [<a href="#R79">79</a>, <a href="#R82">82</a>, <a href="#R83">83</a>].
               
            </p>
            <p id="d1e626">If gender relations between women and diversity groups with the police are detrimental
               for the former, it is striking to see the insecurities’ female police officers face
               within the institution itself, and how these reflect power relations in society. Given
               that the police are immersed in the country’s cultural gender constructions, policewomen
               encounter many difficulties in attempting to fulfill their work. According to Hilda,
               a middle-ranking police woman, there is a problem with gender within the police because
               many men in power still think there is no need to make changes that can differentially
               include women, or to make women visible. Men still think that the space for women
               is at home.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e628">
               <i>‘‘The problem with gender is that men believe that when it comes to women there is
                  no need to make changes. Because they still believe that, the things that are said
                  for them are also said for us. And when we want to make use of those laws that are
                  written in male, simply when they make legal interpretations, they say no, that (those
                  laws) refer to men. So? And they do not want to make us visible in the laws either.
                  It is very complicated, even despite all the individual will that exist, of some men
                  who are in important positions, the assumption that it is not necessary for women
                  to be visible prevails. And I think many are still thinking that our space is cooking
                  and taking care of children’’</i> [<a href="#R84">84</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e636">Hilda’s statement reflects the difficulties for women to access law in general. In
               the police, she says, there is a similar situation. By the time of the interview in
               2017, there were 2,875 female officers in total in the institution in comparison to
               20,095 policemen. Of those, only 21 women are in high-ranking roles compared to 138
               men, and 79 women are in mid-ranking roles in comparison to 735 men. These numbers
               are telling of the remaining gender gaps within the institution.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e638">It is very common for policewomen to experience verbal abuse from policemen, regardless
               of their rank. There are around 1–2 accusations daily. Furthermore, according to female
               police participants in the group interview, there are many reasons for this, some
               of which are related to gender stereotypes that position women as weak and in need
               of protection, which hampers women’s police in operative work. Another common problem
               women police encounter is sexual harassment by other police members, which reflects
               power imbalances at work, a macho culture, and poor infrastructure for women to feel
               safe.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e640">Therefore, by becoming aware of the mechanisms within the police to ensure gender
               equity and equality, a diverse group of female officers is acknowledging the remaining
               unequal power structures and the different forms of violence they experience in their
               work. Led by the Gender Unit of the PNC and supported by feminist organizations, they
               have organized themselves in a network as supporters and protectors of their rights
               i.e. the Women Defenders Network of Human Rights of Women working in the National
               Civil Police. The intention of this network is to support women in the police to denounce
               cases of abuse, violence, or discrimination in their work environment. The network
               also works to support the leadership position of female police within the institution.
               Furthermore, this network of female police, as well as the women special units, can
               be understood as an attempt to close the gap between policy and practice in the implementation
               of gender and COP. In their current situation, they remain imperfect examples of gender-sensitive
               approaches to human security policies, because even though they include a differentiated
               security need, from the perspective of women, they are still relegated from an institutional
               discussion about the meaning of security and the role of gender. The Gender Unit in
               the PNC with the support of women organizations has attempted to open these discussions
               within the police, but they remain marginalized in a rigid hierarchical structure.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e642">Loyalty to the institution is stronger than strategic gender alliances. Thinking back
               on the gender imbalance in police members, it is striking to see how male dominated
               the police in El Salvador remains regardless of attempts to make it more inclusive.
               This characteristic is similar to the almost exclusively male constitution of the
               military. Even though women have taken military roles since 1980, they ‘‘have not
               challenged the state military’s essentially masculinized culture’’ [<a href="#R44">44</a>]. The PNC remains a brotherhood, not a sisterhood. This was shockingly demonstrated
               by the feminicide of the police agent Carla Ayala, shot and disappeared by another
               police agent in an official car on December 28<span class="inline-formula">

                  </span>, 2017. After the news went public, it took the PNC nine months to find her remains
               and more than a year to determine it was a case of feminicide. The agent who killed
               her is still a fugitive [<a href="#R85">85</a>, <a href="#R86">86</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e668">Cases of feminicide within the police are not new but remain invisible because of
               the macho culture that dominates. Rendering these cases visible and creating gender
               self-awareness is a difficult task when women in the institution feel they must prove
               themselves as worthy of the job and loyal enough to be accepted into ‘the pack’. Therefore,
               the case of Carla Ayala shook the police at the deepest level and challenged the naturalization
               of gender-based violence against women within the institution. This demonstrated that
               beyond gender mainstreaming, there is a need to transform the cultural constructions
               and understandings about gender and the use of violence, as this not only affects
               the development of the police as an inclusive institution but also its approach to
               their policing work. For the successful implementation of COP and gender, there is
               a need to revise the PNC’s own system of accountability within the institution and
               towards the community [<a href="#R87">87</a>].

            <p id="d1e676">The 1992 Peace Accords and Security Reform were an opportunity to de-militarize, professionalize
               and create a new security paradigm in El Salvador based on a civilian focus and mandate
               that could safeguard a sustainable peace. However, research focused on current realities
               reveals that the objectives of this reform are closer to unfulfilled promises than
               to actual transformations within the police and the overall security structure.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e678">This article reveals that the security reform focused on the structural transformation
               of the military and the police failed to sufficiently question the meaning of security
               or the identity of the subject of security and the security provider. By neglecting
               to question the object and matter of security in a country that had been under military
               rule almost since its foundation [<a href="#R4">4</a>], the relationship between male dominance, the state, and security was ignored. Masculine
               security logics were portrayed as being gender neutral. However better reframed as
               gender blind, the security logic in El Salvador has rendered invisible the differential
               experiences of insecurity and violence in the country by restricting security to criminality,
               while naturalizing forms of gender-based violence against women and sexually diverse
               groups and ignoring the socio-economic origins of post-war insecurity. The gendered
               construction of security and the limits of its definition have restrictively gendered
               the work of the police, privileging repressive tactics to address crime and insecurity
               instead of new approaches to policing that could reduce violence and bring social
               transformation, such as Community-Oriented Policing.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e683">I have argued above that the gendered nature of security policy allowed post-war administrations
               to justify the introduction of military personnel and logics into internal security
               policy and policing in the country. Furthermore, the presence of ex-combatants in
               the new police, made possible through the quota system, contaminated the early development
               of this institution and revealed it to be a new political battlefield. All the administrations
               that followed the 1992 Peace Agreements have until present constructed and strengthened
               a narrative of security based on a war-like scenario that reminds of the 12 years
               of confrontations between the guerrillas and the state.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e685">I have also highlighted above that prevalence of a masculinist state and the privileging
               of male dominance and the cultural associations of violence and masculinity, has not
               permitted the implementation of integral approaches to security and models of policing
               that prioritize community work over operative strategies with the objective of reducing
               violence. In this context, fieldwork reveals that the local police agents found themselves
               between the need to fulfill their duties as preventers and repressors of crime, implementing
               COP while taking part or acknowledging joint military-police operations in similar
               communities, if not the same, in the name of security. These military-police operations
               have validated the performance of violent masculinities within the PNC to the level
               that police students newly graduated from the ANSP already know that they will have
               to assume a tough approach to policing in the streets if they want to be accepted.
               Women police officers also feel a constant need to prove they can perform a tough,
               almost violent masculinity in order to be accepted into operative work.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e687">This paper argues that, by failing to question the subject of security and its gendered
               dimension, it has been impossible to secure good results from the introduction of
               COP in El Salvador. I suggest that this is because the police do not operate in a
               cultural or social vacuum but is embedded in society. Socio-cultural assumptions that
               value and justify dominant and authoritative expressions of masculinity over the autonomy
               of the female body and the recognition of other forms of violence, influence the state
               responses to insecurity and, therefore, the focus of the police towards repression
               instead of prevention. Privileging militarized security strategies renders other forms
               of policing as less efficient, effective, and, thus, less masculine. In this context,
               COP has become little more than a marginal approach to policing and gender no more
               than a mainstreamed formality.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e689">Nevertheless, when the subject of security is stretched and the different security
               needs of women, men and LGBTI population in the community are included, it creates
               alternatives able to transform community-police relationships by means of challenging
               militarized expectations and ‘violent’ traditions within the police. The discussion
               presented in this article illustrates the idea that when the subject of security is
               challenged and gender is not ignored, policing can take other forms and focus more
               on the people it aims to serve, making room for the implementation of democratic policing
               to take place in the form of community-oriented practice. Therefore, more efforts
               and research need to be put into understanding and supporting the transforming gendered
               expectations of security within the police, as a bottom-up approach to gender mainstreaming
               the security policy in El Salvador.

                           Feminicidio is a concept coined by Marcela Lagarde, a Mexican Anthropologist, derived
                           from Diane Russell's femicide concept. While Femicide refers to the gender-based killing
                           of women, Lagarde feared that the Spanish translation of the concept would only refer
                           to women's homicide removing all the socio- cultural and political connotations of
                           the concept. Therefore, Feminicidio, feminicide as I use it in this article, refers
                           to the set of violations against the human rights of women, including crimes and disappearances
                           of women, and adduces the responsibility to the State in terms of its inaction and
                           the high levels of impunity
                           .
