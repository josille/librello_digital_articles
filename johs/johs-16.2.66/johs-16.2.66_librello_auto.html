                                 age group. Some of the identified insecurities and respective resolutions are related
                                 to the role of and attitudes toward police in Kosovo, who are the main formal security
                                 provider in Kosovo. This is addressed in the first part of the article. The second
                                 part addresses these attitudes toward police, analysing youth perspectives on performance,
                                 procedural justice and distributive justice. Primary data from semi-structured focus
                                 group discussions with Kosovar youth are used for the analyses. Five key types of
                                 insecurities were identified: (1) job-related (unemployment), (2) drug-related, (3)
                                 school-related, (4) physical and (5) inequality-related. Results also show that attitudes
                                 toward police are predominantly poor and seem to stem mainly from a performance perspective,
                                 followed by a procedural justice perspective.</span></div>

                              <p id="d1e81">In February 2008, Kosovo unilaterally declared its independence from Serbia after
                                 the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia had collapsed in 1992 and the State Union
                                 of Serbia and Montenegro split after a referendum in 2006. The declaration came ‘‘after
                                 years of strained relations between its Serb and mainly Albanian inhabitants. It has
                                 been recognised by the United States and major European Union countries, but Serbia,
                                 backed by its powerful ally Russia, refuses to do so, as do most ethnic Serbs inside
                                 Kosovo’’ [<a href="#R1">1</a>]. Kosovo has a mixed past, with periods of confrontation as well as periods of contact
                                 and co-operation across ethnic and religious boundaries [<a href="#R2">2</a>]. In the 1990s, however, the ethnical tensions reached a violent peak, which included
                                 ethnical cleansing and other war crimes from both sides, in the Kosovo War of 1998-1999.
                                 Kosovo is now home to about 2 million citizens, scattered over an area about one-fourth
                                 the size of the Netherlands (10,887 square kilometres).
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e89">Still, ‘‘in 2011, Kosovo received 19 times more developmental aid than the average
                                 developing country. Moreover, in per capita terms Kosovo received 50 times more peacekeeping
                                 troops and 25 times more funds from the international community than Afghanistan did
                                 after 2001’’ ([<a href="#R3">3</a>], pp.&nbsp;20-21). Although this assistance worked out differently in each country ([<a href="#R4">4</a>], p.&nbsp;36), ‘‘it has arguably contributed to the consolidation of hybrid state institutions,
                                 the reproduction of patron–client political relations, and the intensification and
                                 monetization of political marketplaces.’’ It also clearly shows the involvement of
                                 the international community even more than ten years after the formal conflict ended.
                                 There are various reasons for this international interest. For the EU, it is in part
                                 related to its proximity to other EU member states: ‘‘The partnership between the
                                 EU and the Western Balkans is in the interest of all sides, promoting peace, stability,
                                 freedom, security and justice, prosperity and quality of life’’ [<a href="#R5">5</a>]. The extent in which international assistance reached the local level and supported
                                 local ownership is criticized, especially for the UN mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) [<a href="#R3">3</a>, <a href="#R4">4</a>, <a href="#R6">6</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e110">Despite the disproportionate amounts of international aid flowing into Kosovo, little
                                 seems to have changed [<a href="#R7">7</a>]: macro-level issues such as corruption, nepotism and ethnic tensions between the
                                 Albanian and Serb populations in Kosovo still infest the region [<a href="#R8">8</a>, <a href="#R9">9</a>, <a href="#R10">10</a>].The developmental lags in Kosovo despite the large amounts of aid are particularly
                                 poignant, as the international community itself has essentially been sitting in drivers’
                                 seat when it comes to, for example, the Kosovar police reform and law-enforcement
                                 reform for the most part [<a href="#R4">4</a>, <a href="#R6">6</a>, <a href="#R7">7</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e134">This study takes a micro-level perspective to analyse the effects of these macro-level
                                 issues on the human security of Kosovo’s youth in particular. By utilizing insights
                                 from the field and capturing the connection between insecurity and affiliated agency,
                                 the concept of human security is advanced and deepened. This group is not only of
                                 particular interest because it represents the future of Kosovo, it is also the largest
                                 age group within its society: about half the population is under the age of 25, while
                                 approximately 65% is under 30 years of age [<a href="#R11">11</a>]. Kosovo is not only Europe’s youngest state; it also inhabits its youngest population.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e139">The present study strives to give Kosovar youth a voice – something that is not usually
                                 done according to some interviewees, despite the attempts made by e.g. youth councils,
                                 governmental youth action strategies, international actors, and so on – and is divided
                                 into two main parts, guided by two research questions per part listed below. The first
                                 part addresses insecurities for young Kosovars and the ways in which they (try to)
                                 resolve these issues. In many cases, the identified insecurities and respective resolutions
                                 are related to the role of and attitudes towards police (ATP) in Kosovo, which are
                                 addressed in the second part of this study. Building on the study design for ATP of
                                 Dirikx, Gelders &amp; Parmentier [<a href="#R12">12</a>], both the <i>perceptions</i> and <i>importance</i> of the following three aspects of police work are addressed: (1) performance, (2)
                                 procedural justice and (3) distributive justice.

                              <p id="d1e174">‘‘Security is an essentially contested concept.’’ ([<a href="#R13">13</a>], p.&nbsp;74). Depending on the field of interest and the different schools of thought
                                 within a particular field, different definitions of security and its antonym are used.
                                 Generally speaking – that is, as defined by dictionaries – security is seen as something
                                 along the lines of ‘being free from risk or danger’. This definition is similar to
                                 the notion of human security, often used in social sciences and referred to in this
                                 study when addressing (in)security for Kosovar youth. However, the definition of human
                                 security, too, is heavily contested in policy and academic debates. The term human
                                 security gained attention in the 1990s, where the UNDP examined human security as
                                 a dual agenda of ‘‘freedom from fear and freedom from want.’’ Later, the Commission
                                 on Human Security defined human security as follows [<a href="#R14">14</a>]: ‘‘Human security means protecting fundamental freedoms […]. It means protecting
                                 people from critical (severe) and pervasive (widespread) threats and situations. […]
                                 It means creating political, social, environmental, economic, military and cultural
                                 systems that together give people the building blocks of survival, livelihood and
                                 dignity.’’
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e182">Two opposing views have developed in the academic debate: a narrow and a broad understanding
                                 of human security. Those in favour of narrowing the concept emphasise the freedom-from-fear
                                 aspect, focussing on ([<a href="#R13">13</a>], p.&nbsp;76) ‘‘violent threats to individuals, while recognizing that these are strongly
                                 associated with poverty, lack of state capacity and various forms of socioeconomic
                                 and political inequity.’’ Advocates of a broader concept of human security, instead,
                                 emphasise on keeping a more holistic approach. They argue that [<a href="#R15">15</a>] ‘‘once the referent of the security agenda becomes the individual, it is impossible
                                 to disentangle violent threats to individuals from other issues such as poverty, environmental
                                 degradation, and infectious diseases that directly impinge on the safety, freedom,
                                 and self-realization of human beings.’’ Either way, the term signifies an alteration
                                 in security studies, which traditionally focused on security of the state mainly [<a href="#R15">15</a>]. Recent research has opted to utilize insights from the field to advance and deepen
                                 the concept of human security [<a href="#R16">16</a>], capturing the (sometimes paradoxical) connection between insecurity and affiliated
                                 agency. This way, research can ‘‘[open] up processes of knowledge production that
                                 allow individual accounts to be constructed, acknowledged and validated has resulted
                                 in a collaborative understanding of human security’’([<a href="#R16">16</a>], p.&nbsp;581) . According to the study by Kostovicova, Martin &amp; Bojicic-Dzelilovic, Kosovars
                                 mainly resort to self-reliance, informality and community solidarity to overcome their
                                 insecurities, but cannot relieve macro-level insecurities posed by a weak state. The
                                 results of this study (see ) show similar resolutions (i.e. agency) applied by youth.
                                 This study addresses the agency of (young) individuals in Kosovo by investigating
                                 resolution mechanisms they employ to overcome everyday-life insecurities. Moreover,
                                 the exploratory nature of the research with youth posed here, suits the holistic and
                                 individual-oriented understanding of security that the broad conception of human security
                                 offers. The focus group participants fully embraced a holistic approach of security,
                                 discussing both socioeconomic and physical insecurities, as well as the interconnections
                                 between them.

                              <p id="d1e202">In part II of this article, ATP of youth are addressed. In the literature, a variety
                                 of terms is used interchangeably with ‘attitudes towards police’ [<a href="#R12">12</a>], and is often treated as a unidimensional concept measuring a general opinion about
                                 the police, also referred to as general support for - or confidence in the police
                                 (for example, [<a href="#R17">17</a>, <a href="#R18">18</a>, <a href="#R19">19</a>]). When ATP is studied as a multidimensional concept, however, there are three main
                                 perspectives on ATP to be distinguished [<a href="#R12">12</a>]: (1) the performance-based perspective, (2) the distributive justice perspective
                                 and (3) the procedural justice perspective. The performance-based perspective seems
                                 most straightforward: it argues that ‘‘people’s ATP are mainly determined by their
                                 views on how effectively the police control crime. If people feel that the police
                                 are effectively controlling crime, that they are keeping the neighbourhood safe and
                                 that crime rates are low, their ATP can be expected to be positive.’’ ([<a href="#R12">12</a>], p.&nbsp;193).
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e223">The distributive justice perspective emphasizes the importance of a fair distribution
                                 of police services across people and communities, regardless of their social, cultural,
                                 economic, ethnical or religious background, nor age or gender [<a href="#R12">12</a>, <a href="#R20">20</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e231">Finally, the procedural justice perspective argues that ATP mainly revolve around
                                 the fairness in the decision-making process and way in which authority is exercised
                                 in general [<a href="#R21">21</a>]. This final perspective can be divided into four underlying elements affiliated
                                 with positive procedural justice: (1) opportunities for participation, (2) friendliness
                                 and politeness, (3) neutrality and (4) trustworthiness [<a href="#R12">12</a>, <a href="#R20">20</a>]. This framework will be used for the analyses of the results (ad-hoc). It was not
                                 used to guide the of focus group discussions in any way.

                              <p id="d1e245">In the summer of 2018, nine semi-structured dual-moderator focus group discussions
                                 were conducted [<a href="#R22">22</a>]. Participants from four out of seven main districts of Kosovo – Pristina, Prizren,
                                 Mitrovica and Ferizaj – were sampled through convenience and snowball sampling [<a href="#R23">23</a>], targeting youth between 16 and 30 years of age who have not entered the labour
                                 market fully or formally yet [<a href="#R24">24</a>]. The Serbian population in Kosovo is difficult to reach, as many boycott surveys
                                 and studies. For this study, fortunately, one focus group was conducted with Serbian
                                 youth too. In total, 46 participants took part in the focus group discussions. All
                                 focus groups were planned with at least seven participants each; however, some participants
                                 did not show up for their focus group. This thus sometimes resulted in smaller group
                                 sizes, but did not render the discussions any less informative or vibrant (sometimes,
                                 quite the opposite). The semi-structured focus group discussions covered the following
                                 main themes in line with the research questions set for this study: (1) insecurities
                                 for young Kosovars, (2) resolution mechanisms and (3) ATP.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e256">It is crucial to conduct focus group discussions in the participants’ native language
                                 so discussions can elapse fluently, especially when interviewing youth. Therefore,
                                 young Albanian-speaking Kosovars, who were trained by the researcher, conducted the
                                 interviews in Albanian. A Bosnian interviewer who speaks Serbian conducted the focus
                                 group with Serbian youth in order to retain a peaceful discussion. The researcher
                                 was present during all focus groups to observe the discussion process. The fact that
                                 these interviewers have a background in Kosovo and are young themselves provided them
                                 with an in-depth and sincere understanding of the participants. It also benefitted
                                 the atmosphere in which participants were able to speak openly. The fact that participants,
                                 especially in the beginning of the discussion, sometimes added sentences like ‘‘you
                                 know that already’’ to the interviewer, shows that they are aware of their background.
                                 In prospect, the interviewers were trained to emphasize the importance of speaking
                                 openly throughout the discussion, also if they thought the interviewer would know
                                 about it already. Both the observing researcher and the interviewers stressed this
                                 as well at the beginning of each focus group. This approach also helped to ‘‘collapse
                                 the distance between the outsider/researcher and those on the sharp end of insecurity,
                                 engaged as partners in the co-construction of the knowledge of security,’’ as done
                                 in the study by Kostovicova et al. ([<a href="#R16">16</a>], p.&nbsp;581), be it in a different way.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e261">An interview guide was set up to provide a broad frame to guide the discussions around
                                 these main themes, making sure none was left out. The guide was only created to keep
                                 the discussions on topic and to initiate discussions; not to systematically steer
                                 them by any theoretical background. This is also true for the theme on ATP, which
                                 is theoretically embedded into the framework presented above. Here, discussions were
                                 initiated by addressing participants’ relation with police in general and by relating
                                 to the role of police in the previously identified insecurities in each focus group.

                                             the highest unemployment rate in the European area [<a href="#R29">29</a>, <a href="#R30">30</a>]. The rates for youth are even higher: approximately 55% of those aged between 15
                                             and 24 were unemployed in 2018 [<a href="#R31">31</a>] - the year in which the interviews took place. Kosovo ranked third in (reported)
                                             youth unemployment around the world in 2019 - just behind South Africa and Libya [<a href="#R27">27</a>, <a href="#R32">32</a>]. Moreover, the situation is getting worse [<a href="#R33">33</a>]: ‘‘Every year, more than 30,000 young people enter the job market. Fewer than 8,000
                                             find work.’’ Youth often face two key disadvantages: lack of experience and a lack
                                             of a professional network [<a href="#R34">34</a>, <a href="#R35">35</a>]. Although the Kosovar government has made combatting youth unemployment a policy
                                             priority, sustainable progress is still to be made [<a href="#R35">35</a>].

                                          <p id="d1e328">The current COVID19 pandemic and its aftermath will most likely worsen the situation.
                                             The impact of the pandemic on the labour market is expected to show in the Kosovo
                                             labour force data in the second quarter of 2020, according to the Kosovo Agency of
                                             Statistics. ‘‘In Q1 2020 some businesses did not close their activities (Pandemic
                                             start) and the impact on the first quarter was very low [<a href="#R28">28</a>] .’’

                                          <p id="d1e333">A wave of job-losses also emerged during the war and its aftermath. For example, Kosovo
                                             lost most of its largest export facility: Trepca mine in the North, housing mainly
                                             lead, zinc, silver and a variety of minerals. Only a fraction of the mines is currently
                                             up and running, employing less than 1400 miners as opposed to some 23 thousand during
                                             its pre-war peak. The mining complex once accounted for over two-thirds of Kosovo’s
                                             gross domestic product, but the strong ethnical tension between Kosovar Albanians
                                             and Serbs loyal to Belgrade in Mitrovica – as well as the costly need for repairs
                                             [<a href="#R33">33</a>]- withholds most of Trepca’s facilities from re-opening [<a href="#R36">36</a>]. The young Kosovars in the North see this as a great loss of jobs, associated with
                                             the privatization of the mines and other previously state-owned factories throughout
                                             the country.

                                          <p id="d1e361">This study identified three main types of job-related insecurities for youth: (1)
                                             being hired for the wrong reasons, (2) the difficulty of getting a job in general
                                             and (3) the difficulty of getting a job on a higher level (suiting one’s study field
                                             and level).
                                          </p>
                                          <p id="d1e363">First of all, being hired for the wrong reasons seems to be a somewhat less common
                                             (or at least less discussed) insecurity; partly because getting a job is difficult
                                             in the first place and most participants were not yet employed. Nonetheless, it marks
                                             a poignant insecurity: ‘‘I’ve had it personally, I went to job interviews and that
                                             look that you get from head to toe is simply terrifying.’’ The girl from Pristina,
                                             who described her experiences with such inappropriate and unprofessional job interviews,
                                             sees this form of harassment as a part of an ever-present fear for women in particular.
                                             More gender-based insecurities are discussed later (see ).
                                          </p>
                                          <p id="d1e365">The difficulties surrounding getting a job, let alone on a higher level, are present
                                             for almost all of the participants and are strongly related to the enduring poor job-market
                                             [<a href="#R27">27</a>, <a href="#R31">31</a>] and youth disadvantages in experience and professional networks [<a href="#R34">34</a>, <a href="#R35">35</a>]. The mechanisms that seem to lie beyond are a variety of power relations deeply
                                             rooted in the Kosovar society. Having family or friends in the respective company
                                             or in high positions in general is necessary to get a job (nepotism), according to
                                             several young Kosovars. Another controversial way to get a job in Kosovo is by paying
                                             for it (corruption). Either way, doing neither strongly decreases your chances of
                                             getting the job, even if you are (more) skilled than other job applicants are.

                                          <p id="d1e379">Youth also report cases where <i>‘‘someone was not accepted [for a job] unless they sent in a picture’’</i> or not being selected for a job because someone looks better. A girl from Mitrovica,
                                             currently working in a call centre as a side job, sums it up quite concisely: <i>‘‘We have to pay [to get a job]. We go with our CV but … maybe there is someone more
                                                beautiful than we are; then she got the [job]! Or she has family there; she got the
                                                [job] too. So if we are just […] going with a CV [to look] for a job, we are not going
                                                to get it.’’</i>
                                             
                                          </p>
                                          <p id="d1e388">Sadly, the youth is largely unable to employ effective resolutions for these job-related
                                             issues other than playing along (i.e. paying up) and hoping for the best (i.e. being
                                             lucky with family and/or friends in important positions). Attempts of utilizing the
                                             help of job-centres or using word of mouth (to improve professional network) and taking
                                             internships (to improve professional experience) to find job openings do not often
                                             seem to get significant results. In some cases, it was argued that it can help to
                                             look for jobs in branches or cities (read: Pristina, the capital) with more job openings,
                                             but it cannot overcome the general lack of job opportunities in Kosovo. To address
                                             these macro-level problematics, structural changes in society need to take place.
                                             Many young Kosovars see emigration into EU states as the resolution for job-related
                                             and financial insecurities. This emphasis on ‘‘getting out’’ showed from the mass
                                             emigration movement which took place in 2015. <i>‘‘Since we were kids, […] you could hear grown-ups talking: ‘There is nothing here,
                                                you have to leave.’ There is this idea integrated that we have to leave in order to
                                                be successful,’’</i> a girl from Pristina stated.

                                             ‘‘In a place [like Kosovo] with high unemployment and poverty rates, with a lack of
                                             an adequate social welfare system, as well as a low GDP, it becomes difficult to define
                                             marginalization and to map certain groups as marginalized. What is more, marginalized
                                             groups [in Kosovo] were not a subject of many studies, and even when they were, not
                                             all groups were covered.’’ ([<a href="#R38">38</a>], p.&nbsp;103). Focus group participants identified two main characteristics prone to
                                             hiring discrimination (apart from youth’ lack of experience and professional network,
                                             addressed previously): (1) political preference and (2) gender.
                                             Some focus groups, notably those held in Prishtina and Prizren, were particularly
                                             dominated by a discussion about political freedom in Kosovo. Some youth who participated
                                             there, were actively involved in discussion groups and voluntary work in their community
                                             and spoke about their experience as supporters of oppositional parties. A girl from
                                             Prizren describes political-based inequality as follows: <i>‘‘For example, someone is a part of a political party and is in opposition, they will
                                                be automatically excluded from the workplace […].’’</i> This is an indication of the poor environment for critical reflection in the Kosovar
                                             political spectrum and sometimes results in physical threats (see ). Kosovo passed
                                             progressive anti-discrimination laws in 2004 already [<a href="#R39">39</a>, <a href="#R40">40</a>] but a need for better law enforcement remains when it comes to political discrimination
                                             as well as other forms of discrimination in the employment sector. While hiring discrimination
                                             based on ethnicity, age and gender has been explored at least to some extent in Kosovo
                                             (for example, [<a href="#R34">34</a>, <a href="#R38">38</a>, <a href="#R41">41</a>]), research exploring political discrimination remains elusive.

                                          <p id="d1e420">For women, it can be more difficult to get a job, as ‘‘a man will get a job before
                                             the girl’’, a boy from a village near Mitrovica stated. The way in which he – probably
                                             unconsciously – worded his statement, shows exactly how deeply gender-inequalities
                                             are embedded into society (i.e. using ‘man’ and ‘girl’ as opposites, instead of ‘man’
                                             and ‘woman’, or ‘boy’ and ‘girl’). A female participant elaborated by arguing: ‘‘People
                                             think that the female gender is more sensitive and they take things too hard, so they
                                             can’t take the right decision […].’’ Gender stereotypes like these may put women in
                                             positions that are less paid or valued [<a href="#R38">38</a>, <a href="#R41">41</a>]. The Kosovar government thus imposed a ‘special’ status for women under the Law
                                             on Labour in article 44 to improve the protection of women employees and decrease
                                             hiring discrimination. However, ‘‘the same Law has negative effects on women as it

                                             months, paid by the employer, and 50% of the average salary in Kosovo for the remaining

                                             On the up side, a participant from Pristina stated that an awareness raising campaign

                                          <p id="d1e436">Insecurities surrounding addictive substances are divided into two aspects: (ab)use
                                             and dealing. It is difficult to gain comprehensive insight in the extent of drug (ab)use
                                             in Kosovo. Although many organisations in Kosovo collect information on drugs, there
                                             are no official statistics available that show representative results [<a href="#R42">42</a>, <a href="#R43">43</a>]. The European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs (ESPAD) studied alcohol,
                                             cigarette and drug use among 15 and 16-year-olds in 2011 and shows that Kosovar substance
                                             use was among the lowest in their study [<a href="#R44">44</a>]. Especially alcohol use in Kosovo was much lower than in other European countries.
                                             The Kosovo Centre for Security Studies addressed the citizens’ perceived security
                                             threat posed by drugs in the first (2012) [<a href="#R45">45</a>] and fourth (2014) [<a href="#R46">46</a>] edition of the Kosovo Security Barometer (KSB). Although over 80 percent of respondents
                                             indicated that they perceived drugs and alcohol as a high risk to societal security
                                             (the highest percentage of the listed internal risks, followed by ‘thefts and murder’
                                             and ‘illegal weapons’) in the first edition of the KSB [<a href="#R45">45</a>], the question was omitted in the following editions. Threats posed by drugs only
                                             came to the fore once more, in the fourth edition, when posing an open question to
                                             identify main threats according to Kosovo citizens. ‘‘Following the level of unemployment
                                             and general economic situation, the respondents have mentioned […] other negative
                                             phenomena such as criminality, insecurity, thefts and drugs [as main internal threats
                                             to security] ([<a href="#R46">46</a>], p.&nbsp;15).’’ About 10 percent of respondents argued that ‘other negative phenomena’,
                                             including drug-related threats, pose the main internal threats to security in Kosovo
                                             [<a href="#R46">46</a>]. Moreover, the Labyrinth Centre, an NGO dealing with the prevention and treatment
                                             of drug and alcohol abuse in Kosovo since its founding in 2002, reported that there
                                             were only a handful of patients with drug abuse issues at the University Clinical
                                             Centre of Kosovo in April 2019, and just under twenty addicts were registered for
                                             continuous methadone treatment. The total number of registered drug users at the Labyrinth
                                             Medical-Psychotherapeutic Centre was 1262 between 2002 and 2019 [<a href="#R47">47</a>]. Although these data are more recent, they are not representative, lack a large-scale
                                             perspective and cannot show trends or comparisons, all of which would render the data
                                             more prone to analysis. This shows the importance of recurrent representative studies
                                             on drug (ab)use in Kosovo [<a href="#R42">42</a>, <a href="#R43">43</a>, <a href="#R48">48</a>].

                                          <p id="d1e476">Finally, statistics provided by the Kosovo Police at request show strong variations
                                             on both the amount of persons arrested and the amount of drugs confiscated in recent
                                             years. Marihuana is the most commonly confiscated drug, and there has been a strong
                                             increase in confiscated heroin in 2017, and especially in 2018 and 2019. While these
                                             data may give some insight into the amounts of narcotics flowing through Kosovo, they
                                             do not show if they were meant for domestic or foreign markets. Especially heroin
                                             is transported along the Balkan route towards markets in Northern and Western Europe
                                             [<a href="#R49">49</a>, <a href="#R50">50</a>].

                                          <p id="d1e484">Substance (ab)use came to the fore in five out of nine focus group discussions and
                                             is seen and treated as a serious insecurity for youth. This girl from Pristina stated
                                             ‘‘I know people who use drugs, but I also know people who say: ‘I’m not stupid enough
                                             to use drugs!’ So there is a 50-50. But it is still an issue as long as the other
                                             50% is using it.’’ Many respondents argue that a large responsibility for the prevention
                                             and repression of addictive substance (ab)use lies with parents as well as police.

                                          <p id="d1e486">Ironically, police efforts of preventing addictive substance (ab)use in school campaigns
                                             does not seem to be followed through when it comes to addressing actual addictive
                                             substance (ab)use and dealing, according to the participants. Police-school campaigns
                                             are one of the intervention methods gleaned from other (Western) contexts. If they
                                             are not followed up with adequate policing on drug dealing and (ab)use, well-meant
                                             school campaigns may have a counterproductive effect: placing police in a position
                                             of hypocrisy and giving off the feeling of ticking a box. Although illegal drug dealing
                                             is not visible to some, others have first-hand experiences with drug dealings taking
                                             place in their neighbourhood. Participants from Mitrovica, Ferizaj and Prizren describe
                                             ‘publicly known’ drug hotspots where no police intervention takes place. This girl
                                             from Mitrovica states: <i>‘‘I know a boy who sells drugs in front of kids, in front of people, in front of the
                                                police. I know. I have seen it with my own eyes!’’</i> Even when dealers are arrested, they tend to get back on the street <i>‘‘too soon’’</i>, continuing with <i>‘‘the same things, the same way.’’</i> Since Kosovo is part of the notorious Balkan route for drug smuggle into Western
                                             Europe, it is important to set up an effective network to stop large-scale drug smuggle
                                             and dealing at lower scales [<a href="#R48">48</a>, <a href="#R49">49</a>, <a href="#R51">51</a>].

                                          <p id="d1e507">Again, most young Kosovars cannot overcome these insecurities by themselves and rely
                                             on police for prevention talks and intervention. When asked if and why young Kosovars
                                             take part in drug dealing, a link to unemployment and the poor financial situation
                                             was immediately made: <i>‘‘[They don’t] sell it for luxury, but they take risks to survive.’’</i>

                                          <p id="d1e515">The educational system holds a central role in the lives of many young Europeans,
                                             Kosovars included. Most youngsters spend large amounts of time on school or university
                                             grounds and school (or college/university)-related insecurities came to the fore quite
                                             often. Four main school-related insecurities were addressed: (1) violence and bullying
                                             in (and around) schools, (2) poor teaching, (3) nepotism and (4) a lack of study fields.
                                             The latter could be seen as one of the less pressing issues, referring to the limited
                                             variety of study fields offered at university colleges in Kosovo. Still, it is yet
                                             another reason for youth to leave the country and wanting to study abroad (see ).

                                          <p id="d1e517">Considering the central role of schools (and universities) in young lives, it is of
                                             great importance that the youth’ safety is ensured there. Nevertheless, many youth
                                             experienced violence in schools, either among students or in the form of force by
                                             school-personnel. Among students, both verbal and physical violence seems widespread.
                                             Many participants argue that bullying is a poignant issue at their respective schools,
                                             which also continues outside of school grounds. For some, according to respondents
                                             from Pristina, persistent victimisation by bullying can lead to feelings of depression
                                             or anxiety and even suicidal thoughts. These negative effects also show from literature
                                             on bullying [<a href="#R52">52</a>]. Although some participants have engaged in so-called anti-bullying clubs and created
                                             movie messages to counter bullying in their schools, there is a lack of sustainable
                                             evidence-based anti-bullying programs in many middle- or low-income countries like
                                             Kosovo. ‘‘Evidence-based anti-bullying programs are only rarely implemented […], mostly
                                             because their implementation requires extensive amounts of resources that are not
                                             readily available’’ ([<a href="#R53">53</a>], p.&nbsp;73).

                                          <p id="d1e525">Various participants state that they have witnessed armed fights (i.e. with knifes
                                             or even firearms) and some even noted cases in which a student died on school grounds
                                             after a fight. In Mitrovica, this girl experienced the following: <i>‘‘In my school there was a case, a student was attacked […], the student was shot
                                                and killed and this happened right on the school entrance.’’</i> Many students refer to the role of the police in such extreme fights and opinions
                                             vary on the police’s ability to ensure safe schools. This girl from Pristina, for
                                             example, wonders whether the police work effectively enough: <i>‘‘I remember, after I graduated, there was a fight in high school and it got pretty
                                                bad because two kids had knives n them and the police came and the fight was stopped
                                                […]. Something like that would happen. And then, a year later, there was a shooting
                                                on high school grounds and a boy died. […] That makes you think, how are the police
                                                working to keep us safe?’’</i> In regards, many schools and universities have engaged either police or private security
                                             guards for surveillance on school grounds. There were also cases noted in which a
                                             somewhat more pro-active resolution was employed: some students are searched (for
                                             weapons, drugs, and other unwanted goods) before entering school grounds.

                                          <p id="d1e533">The use of force by school-personnel surfaced less often during the focus group discussions,
                                             but is important to note, nonetheless. A girl from Pristina, for example, describes
                                             the following scene: <i>‘‘A school principal removed a girl’s hijab forcefully in front of all of the students,
                                                you know, in order to do something like this you would have to be conscienceless’’</i> (see ). However, students usually seem to refrain from reporting misconduct, according
                                             to this boy from Mitrovica: <i>‘‘Most students are hesitant in expressing their problems. I am in the position of
                                                chairman of parliament and still no student has reported a professor for misconduct
                                                even though I know there a lot of cases.’’</i> There seems to be a need for more supervision of school-personnel in this regard.
                                             Moreover, teachers tend to dismiss students who for some reason are deemed troublesome
                                             in class. Kosovar students often land on the streets when dismissed from class, instead
                                             of staying on school grounds. Respondents argued that this could put them in dangerous
                                             situations, depending on the age and background of the student.

                                          <p id="d1e541">Another identified difficulty related to schools lies with its teaching. Some youth
                                             complained about the poor quality of teaching from old-fashioned teachers: <i>‘‘[The student] feels tired, because for seven hours […], [the student] has a communist
                                                teacher who does not know anything. Who, for 30 years, has [had] the same notes […]
                                                and says ‘take the pen and write!’. [A teacher] who does not [include] anything interactive
                                                […].’’</i> Some (formal) efforts have been made to shift the traditional educational culture
                                             in Kosovo to, for example, learner-centred education [<a href="#R54">54</a>, <a href="#R55">55</a>]. However, change is often resisted by educational leaders, and – as noted by respondents
                                             – teachers. ‘‘Transitioning from understanding to implementation should be supported
                                             vis-à-vis an educational culture that embraces this new philosophy as a precondition
                                             to successful change of teacher beliefs and practices’’ ([<a href="#R53">53</a>], p.&nbsp;60).

                                          <p id="d1e555">Furthermore, when it comes to teaching, the Albanian-Serbian tension in the North
                                             of Kosovo leads to gaps between the educational curricula. This Albanian-Kosovar boy
                                             from Mitrovica argued how some Serb students were taught misleading information in
                                             school: <i>‘‘During the contact I had with some Serbs, I noticed […] that they are wrongly informed.
                                                Either it is information they have learned by mistake or they have been brainwashed
                                                by the media and their educational system. They think that, during the war, about
                                                13 thousand Serbs were killed</i> [<a href="#R56">56</a>]<i>, which, in my opinion, is very untrue, because the majority who suffered loss and
                                                damage during the war were Albanians. […].’’</i> The ethnical conflicts between Albanian and Serbian Kosovars has left its mark on
                                             the educational system. During the rising ethnical tensions in the 1990s, Kosovar
                                             Albanians established an underground parallel schooling-system as [<a href="#R54">54</a>] ‘‘a reaction to the Serbian government’s measures demanding that only the Serbian
                                             language and history be taught in public schools.’’ Even today, a parallel system
                                             remains. This time, however, Serb communities reject the integration of their educational
                                             system into the mainstream Kosovar educational system. Although educational reform
                                             is one of the key priorities of the Kosovar government (‘‘to promote [a] democratic
                                             and multi-ethnic society’’), integrating the ethnically defined school-systems of
                                             both sides has not been treated as a high priority ([<a href="#R57">57</a>], p.&nbsp;91). This is of great concern, as (higher) education is seen as a crucial component
                                             of political transformation, contributing significantly to the peace and reconciliation
                                             process [<a href="#R56">56</a>].

                                          <p id="d1e576">Finally, the widespread power relations surrounding nepotism are also found in the
                                             educational system: whether it is about getting into certain universities or about
                                             bargaining for better grades, family (or friends) in higher places are valuable social
                                             capital in the educational career too. In Prizren, <i>‘‘if you do not have family [or anyone familiar] inside, or know people, you can’t
                                                be registered in university’’</i>, a girl stated. A girl from Mitrovica also describes how connections seem more important
                                             than skill, as she addresses the prevalence of nepotism in high schools and universities
                                             as follows: <i>‘‘I have seen someone hand in a blank paper with no answers during the entrance exam
                                                and then they are first on the acceptance list. No one can convince me that that person
                                                deserved a place in the university, because I know in high school they barely graduated.
                                                In every institution it’s obvious there is nepotism.’’</i> It is no wonder that many argue that nepotism, like corruption, is everywhere in
                                             Kosovo.

                                          <p id="d1e587">Physical dangers belong to insecurities with which police and parallel security providers
                                             in Kosovo are most directly concerned with: and there are a lot. In general, it can
                                             be said that physical insecurities are strongly represented not just by <i>being</i> unsafe, but also by <i>feeling</i> unsafe. Five identified insecurities were linked to physical dangers, whether it
                                             be merely feeling unsafe or actually being unsafe: (1) dangerous traffic, (2) (violent)
                                             property crime, (3) attacks or abuse (e.g. due to ethnical conflicts), (4) homicide
                                             and (5) gender-based violence.

                                          <p id="d1e595">First of all, the dangerous traffic poses a risk to both young and old Kosovars, noted
                                             participants. There seems to be low law abidance when it comes to traffic rules and
                                             driving in the Balkans [<a href="#R58">58</a>]: ‘‘Burim Krasniqi from the Ministry of Infrastructure believes that stricter law
                                             enforcement by police is overdue and can help to reduce the number of accidents.’’
                                             Police data from 2013 to 2019 show that there were between 110 and 129 road deaths
                                             annually [<a href="#R59">59</a>]. This roughly amounts to seven road deaths per 100.000 residents. Although the amount
                                             of traffic tickets issued in 2019 increased as opposed to the previous year (+ 11.09),
                                             the amount of traffic accidents also rose (+ 2.17%). Despite ‘‘great efforts to increase
                                             safety in road traffic’’ from the Kosovo Police, the amount of (fatal) accidents remains
                                             problematic. There are several international handbooks on road safety, but [<a href="#R60">60</a>]: ‘‘local [road traffic] experts have to assess if and how results from these studies
                                             can be transferred to their own settings.’’ In Kosovo, effective road engineering
                                             can be challenging due to limited resources and a lack of data and information for

                                          <p id="d1e609">Secondly, (violent) property crime such as burglaries and robberies stem from the
                                             poor economic situation and tight job market in Kosovo, according to the participants.
                                             There is a strong presence of organised crime gangs, which may have a part in robberies
                                             too, however, gang activities were not discussed in any of our focus groups. Only
                                             a few participants identified such dangers as insecurities, and only a few actually
                                             experienced them. According to data from the United National Office on Drugs and Crime
                                             (UNODC), Kosovo ranks low compared to many other European countries when it comes
                                             to reported property crimes [<a href="#R62">62</a>, <a href="#R63">63</a>]. In 2018, the rates per 100,000 inhabitants were 256.81 for burglaries, 324.37 for
                                             theft and 11.95 for car theft. The most recent available rate for robberies in Kosovo
                                             lies at 17.21 in 2017. It must be noted, however, that these data rely on reported
                                             cases to police, which is not as common in Kosovo as it may be in other European countries.

                                          <p id="d1e617">The UNODC data on serious assault show a similarly low ranking for Kosovo in the European
                                             region (rate of 16.98 per 100,000 in 2018) [<a href="#R61">61</a>, <a href="#R62">62</a>]. Nevertheless, respondents emphasized the fear of attacks or abuse multiple times
                                             (which, of course, need not be serious assault cases or may not be reported to police
                                             (as such)). Some youth described that, at times, they even fear for their lives due
                                             to aggression of other individuals. The homicide rate in Kosovo was among the highest
                                             in the other former Yugoslavian states shortly after Kosovo declared its independence,
                                             but has gone down considerably in recent years [<a href="#R64">64</a>]. Having witnessed violence and even killings on school campuses (see ), it is not
                                             surprising that many young Kosovars carry this fear with them. The threats do not
                                             come from peers only, <i>‘‘I know many cases from my colleagues [including himself, ed.], who have asked questions
                                                to the prime minister and have been threatened with life’’</i>, a boy from Pristina said. This poor environment for critical feedback shows how
                                             toxic the relationship between youth and their government is. Next to numerous fights
                                             taking place on school grounds (see ), participants identified two groups who are
                                             argued to cause fights and at times attack others: mentally instable individuals in
                                             Ferizaj and Serbian troublemakers in Mitrovica. The first is addressed below and the

                                             often than males [<a href="#R69">69</a>], as is the case in many countries. Kosovo ranks highest in the UNODC data for South-Europe
                                             on reported sexual violence (24.7) and sexual exploitation (15.5) rates per 100,000
                                             inhabitants, but these rates lie below those of many Northern and Western European
                                             countries [<a href="#R61">61</a>, <a href="#R62">62</a>]. It would be inaccurate, however, to conclude that sexual violence and exploitation
                                             is thus simply less apparent in Kosovo. Previous research has pointed out that many
                                             women do not report cases of sexual abuse to police. Stigmatization of victims of
                                             sexual abuse keeps them from reporting and also makes finding justice particularly
                                             difficult [<a href="#R70">70</a>, <a href="#R71">71</a>]. Respondents pointed out that even when cases are reported, they are not always
                                             taken seriously. According to this girl from Ferizaj: <i>‘‘The police are active and working only when it’s very serious, when something very
                                                bad has happened. For example, when I have issues with the boys in my class, or even
                                                when I am harassed in the street, I report the incident and they do not do anything.
                                                Even though it bothers me very much. You cannot find a solution with the police, even

                                          <p id="d1e693">The most prevalent and deeply rooted tensions in Kosovo remain based on ethnicity
                                             – intertwined with religion to some extent. Albanians and Serbs who once lived peacefully
                                             as neighbours turned to archenemies during and after the collapse of Yugoslavia. Nationalism
                                             sprung in the Balkans and, while leaping into a large-scale civil war, one after another
                                             separated from Yugoslavia. Kosovo, which had been part of Serbia, sought independence
                                             in 2008. Many Albanians see the Serbs as the main aggressors in the conflict, while
                                             Serbs blame Albanians for annexing land considered theirs. Therefore, there is an
                                             ever-present tension between the Albanian majority in Kosovo and the Serbian minority
                                             clustered mainly in the North. This has put especially young Kosovars in an identity
                                             crisis, be it in different ways.

                                             also coincide with language and religious differences ([<a href="#R74">74</a>], p.&nbsp;4).’’ Language and culture are at the core of Albanian ethnic identity forming,
                                             surpassing religious identity. Previous studies have suggest that religion is more
                                             important for Serbs, although religious identity may not serve the same way in today’s

                                             identity forming and their identifying of out-groups in Kosovo. An Albanian-Kosovar
                                             respondent took ‘‘watch your language’’ to a whole new level, stating: <i>‘‘When we go there [North-Mitrovica with Serb majority], we barely speak Albanian,
                                                because if they hear you speaking…’’.</i> Language is a way in which ‘troublemakers’ (be it Serb or Albanian) identify their
                                             in-group and potential targets from the out-group. Moreover, participants from Prizren
                                             spoke about conflicts between the Turkish (speaking) population and the Albanian speaking
                                             majority. This girl, however, seems to have found that socializing and communication
                                             is key in resolving these insecurities. <i>‘‘I have some friends that speak Turkish […], most of the time we communicate in Turkish
                                                […]. When I said a Turkish word, [others] were swearing ‘why are you speaking Turkish?’
                                                […]. But now, they are used to us, and are more curious to learn something new, and
                                                by socializing with them I think this problem can be resolved.’’</i> Although Turks and Albanians do not share the same conflict as Albanians and Serbs
                                             do, this resolution does show promise. Under the right conditions, similar contact
                                             between peers may be beneficial to strengthening the relationship between Serbs and
                                             Albanians too (contact hypothesis [<a href="#R75">75</a>]) [<a href="#R73">73</a>, <a href="#R76">76</a>].

                                             Census which was boycotted by many Serbs [<a href="#R77">77</a>] 88% according to the European Social Survey [<a href="#R78">78</a>] religion is not generally seen as a core part of the Albanian identity [<a href="#R73">73</a>]. This sometimes leads to situations like this: <i>‘‘One day a man was looking weirdly at me and was walking towards me, I think he wanted
                                                to remove my hijab but I quickly left.’’</i> The same issue arose in schools where participants were not allowed to wear a headscarf
                                             until recently. Even though there is a Muslim majority in the Kosovar population,
                                             wearing affiliated clothing is sometimes frowned upon, as it does not fit the moderate
                                             religious environment. In Kosovo, religion is a private matter and bears much less
                                             importance than ethnicity (i.e. Albanian versus Serb) [<a href="#R73">73</a>, <a href="#R79">79</a>]. At the same time, however, religious radicalization has become a hot topic in Kosovo
                                             since many young Kosovars left for Syria [<a href="#R80">80</a>]. Multiple recent studies explore the parallelism between relative secularity and
                                             radicalization in Kosovo (for example, [<a href="#R79">79</a>, <a href="#R81">81</a>, <a href="#R82">82</a>]. Despite this, religious radicalization did not come the fore in our focus groups
                                             and is thus not explored here.

                                          <p id="d1e753">Albanian youth in Mitrovica are particularly concerned with Serb ‘troublemakers’ who
                                             mainly roam the Northern part of the city. A boy from Mitrovica argues that the Albanian-Serb
                                             tension sometimes lead to (feelings of) unsafety, <i>‘‘because we cannot move there [North-Mitrovica] freely. […] Because there are [Serbian]
                                                gangsters and people brought there to make trouble.’’</i> Youth also describe seemingly random attacks by Serbs when crossing the main bridge.
                                             In turn, Serb youth stated that they were bullied by their Albanian peers. For example,
                                             a Serbian girl stated, <i>‘‘Some Muslim kids back in the high school were bullying me because of my nationality.

                                                to work, they want to have good conditions to live in,’’</i> this boy from Mitrovica insists. Serb participants indeed noted concerns revolving
                                             unemployment, as well as multiple physical and school-related insecurities that are
                                             similar to those experienced by the Albanian population.

                                             formal success (e.g. ‘‘The First Agreement of Principles Governing the Normalization
                                             of Relations’’, established in 2013), but real reconciliation seems far away. <i>‘‘Every time conflicts are mentioned, we immediately go to the [relationship] between

                                       in focus, because ‘‘policing in socialist systems was oppressive and not citizen-oriented’’;
                                       and, ‘‘police had lost its role as a defender of law and order and instead become

                                       would be able to guarantee their safety.’’

                                    <p id="d1e792">After Kosovo declared independence and a new police force was established, a division
                                       remained between Serb and Albanian officers (see Par I  and Part II ). The intervention
                                       reforms did not change attitudes of police officials nor the political culture. ‘‘Concerns
                                       about the real ‘human security’ situation for individuals on the ground, in particular
                                       vulnerable groups […] remained’’ ([<a href="#R82">82</a>], p.&nbsp;464).

                                    <p id="d1e797">Moreover, a main concern regarding international police reforms in the Western Balkans
                                       is the way in which foreign forces seem to impose reforms, lacking (sufficient) consideration
                                       of local experiences with police and other state-led security forces, as well as insufficient
                                       support of local elites [<a href="#R84">84</a>]. Sustainable development in these areas must be supported by political commitment
                                       of domestic actors. In Kosovo in particular, there was a lack of security in the immediate
                                       aftermath of the NATO interception in 1999. This may not only have given way to criminal
                                       groups taking hold, but also ([<a href="#R83">83</a>], p.&nbsp;17) ‘‘shaped relations between Albanians and Serbs until today, created the
                                       enclave structure into which Serbs withdrew and undermined trust of Serbs and other
                                       minorities in the effective security provision and guarantees by NATO and other international
                                       organizations.’’

                                       are analysed and categorised alongside three perspectives: performance-based, the

                                          <p id="d1e810">Topics surrounding police were discussed thoroughly in the focus groups. From a performance-based
                                             perspective, participants generally argue that police do not <i>‘‘do their job’’</i> nor provide a feeling of safety, as noted previously (see ). Part of these negative
                                             opinions are formed by experiences of ineffective police interventions and prevention
                                             of fights among students at schools (see ). Another performance-based perspective
                                             that affects ATP is related to their responses to emergency calls. In some cases,
                                             response speeds were satisfactory. The general tendency, however, is that police are
                                             ‘‘always late’’ or even unreachable by phone. For example, <i>‘‘On the town square, one was stabbing another with a knife. We all saw it and called
                                                the police, but they did not answer. […]. We all saw it, women crying, children; nothing!’’</i> Multiple participants had experienced or heard of similar cases at which no one answered
                                             the emergency hotline.
                                          </p>
                                          <p id="d1e818">Furthermore, police performance is negatively affected by miscommunications and misunderstandings
                                             in arrests: <i>‘‘We had a case with our neighbours. The police came to their house several times
                                                claiming someone had done something illegal but they had mistaken the person and there
                                                were always misunderstandings, this didn’t happen once but a number of times, and
                                                they always convicted the wrong person. This is absurd!’’</i> The reason for these mix-ups remain unknown to the respondents.
                                          </p>
                                          <p id="d1e823">Finally, in almost all focus group discussions, young Kosovars voiced the feeling
                                             that police are not capable or motivated to investigate cases and help citizens with
                                             their troubles. Some examples of lacking investigation and help from police were noted
                                             in previously. In short, <i>‘‘people always say ‘hope no one will need them [ed. the police]’ […]. This makes
                                                you suspect that they will not help you if you need them. And often, we hear cases
                                                when citizens do not report problems at the police station, because they know that
                                                the police won’t help and will only waste their time.’’</i> Police’s poor (motivation for) investigation thus keeps residents from engaging police
                                             for emergencies and reporting offenses. <i>‘‘My friend had a fight and when he wanted to report it to the police, a police officer
                                                said ‘Do not report it, because it is not worth it. No one will take care of it.’’</i>, a girl from Prizren explained.

                                          <p id="d1e831">Concluding, many factors cause youth to view police performance as poor. However,
                                             many see internal aspects of the Kosovar police as limiting and thus causing poor
                                             performance to some extent. On the one hand, youth argue that <i>‘‘maybe, they [ed. the police] did not want to risk their lives, but it is somewhat
                                                absurd. Perhaps this is a result of low salaries. Why risk your life for 200 or 300
                                                euros?’’</i> These low salaries in combination with poor health insurance may not be the best
                                             motivation for police officers to intervene in potentially dangerous situations. Moreover,
                                             participants pointed out that police are often <i>‘‘old’’</i> and <i>‘‘old-fashioned’’</i>, potentially limiting effective performance: <i>‘‘I think the police should be ‘in’ with the 21<span class="inline-formula">

                                             tensions. The power relations in Kosovo have surfaced multiple times in the focus

                                          <p id="d1e867">Moreover, emergency calls or reporting from young Kosovars are sometimes not taken
                                             seriously. This leads many to utilize different mechanisms for problem resolution
                                             (i.e. resorting to family members): <i>‘‘If we feel insecure we just call our family members. There is no hope for the police
                                                because if he [ed. the police officer] sees you: ‘Oh it has to be your fault because

                                          <p id="d1e872">The ethnical tension and affiliated police division by ethnicity leads to unequal
                                             distribution of police forces in Mitrovica. Albanian police officers work in the South
                                             and Serbian police officers are employed in the North, backed by international forces
                                             such as the NATO-led peacekeeping Kosovo Force (KFOR). Youth voiced their concerns,
                                             arguing <i>‘‘KFOR isn’t going to stay here forever, neither is the international police. Then
                                                we’ll be left with these policemen who have never actually, maybe, been on the northern
                                                side. You have to know what you’re doing.’’</i> Local police forces stand before the challenge of being able to ensure the security
                                             of all residents of Mitrovica before the international police forces withdraw. Withdrawal
                                             issues are not just a problem for international police forces, but for many other
                                             internationally led initiatives and projects dependent on foreign donors as well.
                                             Also, research suggests that ‘‘the often intrusive approach of external actors in
                                             domestic security provision can certainly be seen as being benign in intent, but it
                                             can also undermine not just citizen trust in the state which is instead placed in
                                             external security providers. It also creates new power-relations which links citizens
                                             to external actors’’ ([<a href="#R83">83</a>], p.&nbsp;17-18).

                                             effect on youth’s perspectives of security. Increased police activity in Mitrovica
                                             can strengthen (feelings of) unsafety: <i>‘‘There is the bridge, and there is police all over. And sometimes when there is a

                                             mentality arguing that police are only there when <i>‘‘something bad has happened’’</i>, police presence does not necessarily provide (a feeling of) security.

                                          <p id="d1e891">The procedural justice perspective regarding police forces in Kosovo is analysed alongside
                                             four sub-sections. First of all, although some youth noted polite and understanding
                                             behaviour of police, others addressed harsh and arrogant behaviour by police. In part,
                                             youth argued that police sometimes use harsh behaviour and force to <i>‘‘scare’’</i> others and keep them from making the same mistakes. To some extent, this hinders
                                             the development of a healthy relationship between police and communities and gives
                                             way to fear: <i>‘‘In most cases we are a little afraid, because when you get closer they have angry
                                                look, and a voice sound like they are going to shout at us, for something not important.’’</i>
                                             
                                          </p>
                                          <p id="d1e899">The limited neutrality of police is strongly affected by the power relations at place.
                                             In general, Kosovar youth views police as corrupt and subject to nepotism: <i>‘‘In Kosovo, you just tell them whose son or daughter you are, or that you know someone
                                                […], and then easily you can corrupt them [ed. the police] with money too.’’</i> A girl from Mitrovica experienced this firsthand when she got stopped for a speeding
                                             and was allowed to drive off without a ticket because the police officer recognized
                                             her last name and appeared to know her grandfather. Once again, these statements indicate
                                             how widespread corruption and nepotism are in Kosovo.
                                          </p>
                                          <p id="d1e904">Regarding participation potential, the general tendency is – again – poor. Although
                                             school campaigns and patrols increase the approachability of police officers according
                                             to the participants, the relationship between youth and police is generally described
                                             as poor. The fact that many Kosovars do not know the emergency number underlines this
                                             distant relationship. This girl from Pristina states, <i>‘‘I think the relationship between the police and the people is basically non-existent
                                                here. A couple of months back, […] journalists would go on the streets and they were
                                                asking people: ‘What’s the police number here in Kosovo?’ […]. And more than half
                                                didn’t even know the number. […]. That’s how much we use the number; so that we don’t
                                                even know the number.’’</i> The emergency number in Kosovo has changed over the years and seems to have caused
                                             confusion: it was 092 during the Yugoslavian regime, 112 after the Kosovo war ended
                                             and 192 since the declaration of independence in 2008. All in all, there are steps
                                             to be taken in order to improve response calls. There is a wish among the respondents
                                             for more communication and cooperation with youth and more transparent information
                                             sharing from the police to improve the participation potential.
                                          </p>
                                          <p id="d1e909">Finally, only one participant (from Mitrovica) voiced that he trusts both the international
                                             and local police. All others deemed the police, like many other Kosovar institutions,
                                             untrustworthy in general. Many participants stated that they trust international police
                                             forces such as KFOR more than local police, because the assume them to be less <i>‘‘influenced’’</i> by, for example, corruption. Also <i>‘‘KFOR […] are considered higher rank than the [local] police and I think they helped
                                                reduce some problems that were apparent here,’’</i> according to our participants. The friendliness of KFOR officers also improved trust
                                             in KFOR among some of our participants. All other statements regarding trust in both
                                             local and international police were performance-based as previously described (see
                                             ). In short, this means, <i>‘‘if I heard more cases that the police succeeded and they’d done their job then I’d
                                                be more trustful. But that’s not the case.’’</i>
                                             
                                          </p>

                              <p id="d1e923">This study aimed to give Kosovar youth a voice and put the human in human security.
                                 ‘‘As reflexive beings capable of computing complex security dilemmas and active agents
                                 in the construction of safer environments, individuals can thus reclaim their rightful
                                 place in a person-centred concept of security’’ ([<a href="#R16">16</a>], p.&nbsp;582). In Part I, insecurities and resolution mechanisms (i.e. agency) of young
                                 Kosovars were analysed. Part II addressed perceptions and importance on performance,
                                 the procedural justice and the distributive justice of police in Kosovo. Primary data
                                 from semi-structured focus group discussions with Kosovar youth were used to explore
                                 a large scope of insecurities when growing up in post-conflict Kosovo.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e928">Four main insecurities were identified in Part I: (1) job-related (including job-related
                                 discrimination), (2) drug-related, (3) school-related, (4) physical insecurities.
                                 Both Serb and Albanian focus groups identified similar insecurities in their everyday-lives.
                                 Ethnic and religious tensions were a recurrent crosscutting theme, related to most
                                 of the aforementioned insecurities. However, many of the identified insecurities are
                                 also interconnected and seem to spring from the weak economic status of Kosovo. Also,
                                 both actual and perceived insecurity are relevant to human security of individuals.
                                 This became especially clear when addressing physical dangers: many feared physical
                                 dangers, but only a few experienced them. This can be caused by an exaggerated perception
                                 of crime rates or by successful avoidance mechanisms – or both. One respondent concluded:
                                 <i>‘‘I would say that there are other insecurities […] and these […] may be much more
                                    difficult than physical ones.’’</i>
                                 
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e933">Any peace-making efforts should therefore take the social and economic context in
                                 Kosovo into account when addressing human security. Furthermore, there seems to be
                                 a discrepancy between the many action plans and handbooks (formal change) on the one
                                 hand, and effective implementation on the other (actual change). Benchmarks of international
                                 missions (such as EULEX) are often exclusively quantitative, although many aspects
                                 of peace and security cannot be measured that way. ‘‘It is important to assess missions
                                 not as box-ticking exercises, but rather carefully consider the extent to which effectiveness
                                 criteria are met’’ ([<a href="#R85">85</a>], p.&nbsp;600).
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e938">Moreover, this study suggests that language has gained importance in establishing
                                 out-groups and (thus) identity, especially for Kosovar-Serbs whose identity has previously
                                 been argued to find its core in religion, rather than language [<a href="#R73">73</a>]. A similar language division was observed between Albanian (for whom language and
                                 culture are core) and Turkish youth. Here, frequent contact in and around school helped
                                 to improve relations between both groups, conform to Allport’s contact hypothesis
                                 [<a href="#R74">74</a>]. Future research could explore if and under what circumstances this may apply to
                                 the relation between young Albanians and Serbs.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e946">Similar to the findings of Kostovicova et al. [<a href="#R16">16</a>], youth may employ small-scale resolutions, but are unable to change the large-scale
                                 problems in Kosovo. Here too, a paradox exists between the insecurities experienced
                                 by youth and their agency to change it. For example, youth named nepotism and corruption
                                 as something that causes insecurity to them. To cope with the consequences this has
                                 for, for example, finding a job, they too (have to) use corruption and nepotism to
                                 their advantage. This develops a vicious circle. Young Kosovars were often unable
                                 to resolve insecurities directly and individually. Most problem resolution revolved
                                 around avoidance and withdrawal on the one hand (i.e. self-reliance), and initiatives
                                 from peers and family (i.e. informality &amp; community solidarity) on the other. To many,
                                 the ultimate resolution mechanism is emigration into EU states for work and/or studying,
                                 which showed from the mass emigration movement, which took place in 2015. Many feel
                                 like <i>‘‘there is nothing here’’.</i>
                                 
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e954">Both local and international police in the region are supposed to ensure the security
                                 of Kosovar youth and all other residents. Some of the identified insecurities, like
                                 unemployment, are difficult and/or not suiting for police to address. However, as
                                 addressed in Part II of this study, there is still much to be done if police aim to
                                 really be (seen as) a helping hand when it comes the resolution of insecurities in
                                 which the police do play a role (e.g. physical dangers). Most arguments for youth’
                                 ATP seem to spring from the performance-based perspective and procedural justice perspective
                                 as described in the theoretical framework, respectively. It indicates that youth find
                                 those two aspects of police most important; however, both aspects are generally evaluated
                                 to be poor. When it comes to trustworthiness of police – part of the procedural justice
                                 perspective – youth merely named performance-based arguments for their general distrust.
                                 Thus, to improve the ATP in general, as well as trustworthiness in particular, police
                                 need to perform better when it comes to tackling the multitude of insecurities young
                                 Kosovars experience when growing up in post-conflict Kosovo. With strong power relations
                                 still intact, this will prove to be a challenge for all. Besides, the future withdrawal
                                 of international resources and forces (such as KFOR) pose a challenge of their own.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e956">This study looked at the individual stories of Kosovar youth, which had to rely on
                                 snowball sampling in order to reach out to respondents. Further randomized quantitative
                                 research is needed to be able see to what extent these insecurities and perspectives
                                 are felt on a larger scale. Difficulties lie with forming a representative sample,
                                 since many Serbian-Kosovars tend to boycott surveys and studies in Kosovo. For this
                                 reason, however, it may be even more interesting to look at the perspectives of Serbian-Kosovar
                                 in a more in-depth study. Future research can also investigate (hiring) discrimination
                                 on the basis of political preference and problems connected to overloaded mental health
                                 centres in, for example, communities surrounding Shtime. Moreover, there is a dire
                                 need for a long-term, representative study on drug (ab)use in Kosovo.
