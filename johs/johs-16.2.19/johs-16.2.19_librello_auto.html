                                 a people- centred police service. Among other things, this involves enhancing police-public
                                 trust and partnerships through community policing (COP). Two state-initiated COP models
                                 have been implemented: the National Police Service’s Community Policing Structure,
                                 and the Nyumba Kumi model of the President’s Office. On paper, police reform and the
                                 two COP models would appear to have the potential to improve police-public cooperation.
                                 In practice, however, implementation has proven difficult. Interviews and meetings
                                 with local community organizations, community representatives and police officers
                                 in urban and rural parts of Kenya indicate that scepticism towards the two COP models
                                 is common, as is refusal to engage in them. But why is this so? Why are these two
                                 COP models unsuccessful in enhancing police-public trust and cooperation? This article
                                 analyses how various contextual factors—such as conflicting socio-economic and political
                                 interests at the community and national levels, institutional challenges within the
                                 police, the overall role and mandate of the police in Kenya, and a top-down approach
                                 to COP—impede the intended police paradigm shift.</span></div>

                              <p id="d1e75">The police are highly dependent on collaboration and information from citizens in
                                 order to provide and maintain security within a state. ‘Without at least partial collaboration
                                 of citizens, police work is impossible’ ([<a href="#R1">1</a>], p. 23). If the police do not have the support of the public, core police tasks
                                 such as investigation, evidence gathering and prevention become more difficult. However,
                                 effective cooperation between the police and the public requires that the police enjoy
                                 a certain minimum level of trust among the population [<a href="#R2">2</a>]. In Kenya, public trust and confidence in the police is generally low [<a href="#R3">3</a>, <a href="#R4">4</a>, <a href="#R5">5</a>, <a href="#R6">6</a>], for various reasons. Firstly, in many African states, the police forces were developed
                                 in order to secure European colonial regimes by coercive means ([<a href="#R1">1</a>], p. 21). Much has changed since independence, but traces of the colonial and post-colonial
                                 state are still evident in many African police systems today, as the nature and purpose
                                 of policing have remained the same ([<a href="#R7">7</a>], p.&nbsp;69). The Kenyan police system was established by and for the British colonialists,
                                 mainly to protect colonial interests [<a href="#R4">4</a>, <a href="#R8">8</a>]. After Kenyan independence in 1963, the mandate of the police remained largely unchanged:
                                 to secure the interests of those in power [<a href="#R4">4</a>, <a href="#R9">9</a>, <a href="#R10">10</a>]. A second factor that contributes to lack of trust in the police is the widespread
                                 practice of individual police officers taking advantage of their position for personal
                                 gain. Public opinion polls rank the police the most corrupt state institution in the
                                 country [<a href="#R9">9</a>, <a href="#R11">11</a>, <a href="#R12">12</a>]. Moreover, out of 180 countries, Kenya was number 144 on Transparency International’s
                                 corruption perception index for 2018 [<a href="#R13">13</a>]. Many members of the public see the police as a hazard, not a protecting force or
                                 a service to the population. In a study conducted in ten urban and rural communities
                                 in Kenya in 2011, the police were identified as a major source of insecurity [<a href="#R14">14</a>]. Another report, based on data collected from 500 households among urban poor in
                                 South Eastleigh in Nairobi in 2015, found that 26% of the violence experienced by
                                 these households had been carried out by the police [<a href="#R15">15</a>]. Further, some crimes are also directly or indirectly attributed to the police [<a href="#R4">4</a>]—with police officers contributing to crime rather to its prevention and detection
                                 [<a href="#R3">3</a>]. The post-election violence in 2007 and 2017 also affected police-public relations.
                                 The violence in the wake of the 2017 national elections were particularly bloody;
                                 according to the official inquiry: ‘the Kenyan police conducted themselves unprofessionally,
                                 used excessive force, and were woefully ineffective in protecting life and property’
                                 ([<a href="#R16">16</a>], p.&nbsp;11).
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e146">In addition to high levels of crime and violence in general, Kenya is struggling to
                                 counter violent extremism. In particular, the Somali jihadi group al-Shabaab regularly
                                 carries out terrorist attacks in Kenya, and several Kenyans have been recruited to
                                 al-Shabaab [<a href="#R17">17</a>]. As is the case also in other countries, the Kenyan state has responded to terrorism
                                 with top-down, militarized measures. This harsh anti-terrorism line has damaged police-public
                                 relations even further [<a href="#R18">18</a>]. The measures employed by the state have been heavily criticized: the police have
                                 been accused of extrajudicial killings, disappearances, harassment, ill treatment
                                 and unlawful detentions—as well as misusing the anti-terror law to collect bribes
                                 and loot houses [<a href="#R19">19</a>, <a href="#R20">20</a>, <a href="#R21">21</a>, <a href="#R22">22</a>, <a href="#R23">23</a>, <a href="#R24">24</a>]
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e173">The Kenyan police system has long been characterized by crime control through reactive
                                 policing practices, widely condemned by Kenyan society [<a href="#R4">4</a>, <a href="#R25">25</a>]. The reform currently underway seeks to address this by improving police-public
                                 relations through initiatives such as community policing (COP)—a concept which has
                                 become popular among donors, governments, police and policymakers worldwide. ‘So popular
                                 is the concept with politicians, city managers, and the general public, that few police
                                 chiefs want to be caught without some program they can call community policing’ ([<a href="#R26">26</a>], p.&nbsp;27). However, COP as such is vague, interpreted and practised differently, with
                                 no consensus on what it entails [<a href="#R27">27</a>]. Despite the many COP projects initiated around the world, agreed definitions of
                                 what community policing is and what it is not do not exist [<a href="#R28">28</a>]. The concept is ‘bedevilled by definitional problems’ ([<a href="#R29">29</a>], p.&nbsp;167) and ‘can be transformed chameleon-like into whatever its practitioners
                                 want it to be’ ([<a href="#R30">30</a>], p.&nbsp;71). On the one hand it can be used as a tool for the state to gather intelligence
                                 to protect itself from its own population and for elites to maintain their power.
                                 On the other hand, COP can serve as a way for the police to improve relations with
                                 the public so as to provide better services, security and safety for and with the
                                 populace. The latter understanding of COP is dominant in the academic literature today.
                                 In practice, however, approaches and implementation vary widely. Some COP models aim
                                 for better effectiveness in terms of quality, responsiveness and accountability for
                                 police services; others focus on greater engagement with local communities for community-based
                                 solutions to local challenges ([<a href="#R27">27</a>], p.&nbsp;4). Each model comes with its own set of activities, goals, expectations [<a href="#R27">27</a>], with differing content, impact and challenges as to implementation. Although COP
                                 is primarily a Western concept, it is increasingly implemented in countries of the

                                 [<a href="#R29">29</a>]. Despite the positive perceptions of COP, there is little evidence of its actual
                                 impact and effectiveness, especially as regards its export to non-Western societies
                                 [<a href="#R29">29</a>]. This is reflected in the literature: empirically based studies of COP approaches
                                 and police-public relations tend to focus on Western contexts [<a href="#R27">27</a>, <a href="#R31">31</a>, <a href="#R32">32</a>, <a href="#R33">33</a>, <a href="#R34">34</a>]. There is a clear need for better understanding of the practices and meanings of
                                 COP across a broader range of contexts.

                              <p id="d1e225">Policing in Africa is still understudied and ‘ethnographic work on public police bureaucracies
                                 in Africa is just beginning’ ([<a href="#R35">35</a>], p.&nbsp;1). This article seeks to contribute to the literature on policing in Africa
                                 as well as the evolving debates on the role of COP in enhancing police-public relations.
                                 In Kenya, two state-initiated COP initiatives for improving police-public relations
                                 have been developed: the National Police Service’ ‘Community Policing Structure’ and
                                 the ‘Nyumba Kumi’ model led by the President’s Office. However, moving from policy
                                 to practice has proven difficult. Why have these two COP models proven unsuccessful?
                                 To answer this, empirical material was gathered during fieldtrips to urban areas in
                                 Nairobi and Mombasa, and rural areas in Kisumu and Siaya counties between January
                                 2016 and May 2018. These areas were selected in order to capture experiences across
                                 urban and rural settings as well as regions—Eastern, Mid- and Western Kenya—with different
                                 local contexts. The findings cannot claim to be representative of the implementation
                                 of the two COP models throughout the whole country. Kenya is vast and diverse entity,
                                 each county and sub-county having its own characteristics in terms of demographics,
                                 culture, livelihood, crime and political alliances. However, the study has identified
                                 some major structural obstacles to proper implementation, closely linked to overall
                                 national and programme-related challenges not solely dependent on local conditions.

                              <p id="d1e230">A total of 35 individual and group interviews were conducted with representatives
                                 from community-based organizations (CBOs), non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and
                                 community members in Mombasa town and in the Majengo and Eastleigh areas of Nairobi.
                                 These included representatives from women’s, youth, human rights and religious organizations,
                                 and members of the two COP forums. To gain insights and experiences from rural areas,
                                 observation was conducted in COP sensitization meetings held by the Directorate of
                                 Community Policing, Gender and Child Protection for local communities and police in
                                 seven villages in Kisumu and Siaya counties. In order to capture police perspectives
                                 and experiences, individual and group interviews were conducted with sixteen police
                                 officers stationed in Mombasa, Nairobi, Kisumu, Siaya, Garissa and Nakuru counties.
                                 Some of these were individual interviews; some participated in a group interview held
                                 in connection with a police training in Nairobi. Due to the sensitivity of the topic,
                                 and the possible implications of interviewee claims and statements, given the current
                                 security context, individuals and organizations who have contributed to the study
                                 have been anonymized.

                              <p id="d1e235">Despite some positive developments occurring within the police system the last decades,
                                 the need to establish better police-public relations and trust in Kenya is still dire.
                                 Work on the current police reform began in the early 2000s, and has now become the
                                 country’s largest and most complex public-sector restructuring attempt since independence
                                 from Britain in 1963 ([<a href="#R6">6</a>], p.&nbsp;2). The post-election violence in 2007 pushed the police reform higher up on
                                 the agenda, and the National Task Force on Police Reforms was established. The Task
                                 Force produced a report, ‘the Ransley Report’, with a roadmap for the reform [<a href="#R36">36</a>, <a href="#R37">37</a>]. The following years brought about several structural changes within the police.
                                 In connection with the redrafting of the 2010 Constitution, the Kenya Police Service
                                 and the Administration Police Service were joined together under one umbrella; the
                                 National Police Service (NPS). The NPS Commission and other oversight bodies such
                                 as the Internal Affairs Unit (IAU) and the Independent Policing Oversight Authority
                                 (IPOA) were also established. In 2015, when Joseph Boinett was sworn in as new Inspector
                                 General (IG) of the NPS, he stated that his goal was a people-centred police [<a href="#R38">38</a>], adding that the aim of the reformation process was to ‘transform the Kenya police
                                 and administration police into efficient effective and professional and accountable
                                 security agencies that Kenyans can trust for their safety and security’ [<a href="#R39">39</a>]. The establishment of the NPS represented a strategic shift towards a more service-oriented
                                 institution; among its main functions is to ‘foster and promote relationships with
                                 the broader society’ [<a href="#R40">40</a>]. Today the mission of the NPS is, according to its website, ‘To provide professional
                                 and people centred police service through community partnership and upholding rule
                                 of law for a safe and secure society’ [<a href="#R41">41</a>]. Clearly, enhancing police-public relationships and trust are central to Kenya’s
                                 current police reform, and community policing is to play a vital role.

                                 <i>Community Policing is the approach to policing that recognizes voluntary participation
                                    of the local community in the maintenance of peace and which acknowledges that the
                                    police need to be responsive to the communities and their needs, its key element being
                                    joint problem identification and problem-solving, while respecting the different responsibilities
                                    the police and the public have in the field of crime prevention and maintaining order</i> ([<a href="#R25">25</a>], p.&nbsp;1).

                              <p id="d1e269">By using this definition, NPS has chosen to focus especially on the ‘soft’ aspects
                                 of policing, such as police responses to community needs, and collaborative problem-identification
                                 and problem-solving. It also highlights that both the public and the police play a
                                 role in crime prevention and maintaining peace and order—in line with the vision of
                                 moving from a police-centric to a more people-centric police.

                              <p id="d1e271">COP is not a new concept in Kenya. Several state and non-state actors have introduced
                                 various types of COP programmes aimed at bringing the police and the populace closer
                                 together [<a href="#R4">4</a>, <a href="#R42">42</a>]. Today, the most widely known COP initiatives in Kenya are the two above-mentioned
                                 state-initiated COP models: the NPS <i>Community Policing Structure</i>, and the <i>Nyumba Kumi model</i> led by the President’s Office. COP was originally launched by former President Mwai
                                 Kibaki in 2005, but the concept did not catch on at the time [<a href="#R25">25</a>]. In connection with the redrafting of the Constitution in 2010 and the shift from
                                 police force to police service, the concept of COP was revived. Today, the function
                                 and objectives of COP are emphasized and grounded in central documents such as the
                                 National Police Service Act [<a href="#R43">43</a>] and the National Police Service Standing Orders [<a href="#R44">44</a>].

                                    <p id="d1e298">The NPS COP model is structured through Community Policing Committees (CPC), from
                                       sub-locations to county level under the County Policing Authority (CPA). These committees
                                       consist of civilians and police who are to meet and report up to the next level/committee
                                       in the chain [<a href="#R25">25</a>]. The chairperson of the CPCs is a civilian; the vice-chair is a member of the police
                                       [<a href="#R25">25</a>]. According to the NPS COP guidelines, membership in CPCs is to be on voluntary basis,
                                       with no reimbursement for participation. Civilian members can participate in a CPC
                                       for two years, with one renewal possible [<a href="#R25">25</a>]. The idea behind the committees is for individuals representing different segments
                                       of the community (youth/children, women/men, schools, business community, religious
                                       groups, etc.) and the police to meet regularly, in order to identify and solve problems
                                       at the community level and coordinate activities, programmes and trainings to promote
                                       security. The main pillars of the NPS COP are problem solving, partnership and police
                                       transformation [<a href="#R25">25</a>]. Further, problem solving entails a ‘joint process of addressing recurring security
                                       problems within a community’; ‘partnership’ is defined as a collaborative effort with
                                       the primary objective of determining security needs and policing priorities; and ‘police
                                       transformation’ refers to ‘a fundamental shift from police-centric to people-centric
                                       policing’ ([<a href="#R25">25</a>], pp.&nbsp;10–11).

                                       Uhuru Kenyatta introduced a COP model called <i>Nyumba Kumi</i> (NK). Similar models are found in several other African countries, including Tanzania,
                                       Rwanda, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, with varying results [<a href="#R45">45</a>, <a href="#R46">46</a>, <a href="#R47">47</a>, <a href="#R48">48</a>]. In Kenya, the NK model was introduced as a strategy for fighting terrorism and
                                       insecurity by improving communication and cooperation between communities and their
                                       police [<a href="#R49">49</a>]. <i>Nyumba Kumi</i> translates as ‘ten households’: however, in Kenya it is not limited to a fixed number
                                       of households, but represents a cluster of people and organizations with shared aspirations
                                       and locality [<a href="#R50">50</a>]. According to the guidelines for implementation:

                                          or a bulla. The concept is aimed at bringing Kenyans together in clusters defined

                                       chiefs (civilians) lead the clusters and report to the local police on matters of
                                       community security—the police are not to formally be members of these clusters. According
                                       to the NK implementation guidelines, members are to be democratically elected for

                                       not reimbursed. NKs are not formally part of the NPS structure, but lie under the

                              <p id="d1e369">Kenyans have long been calling for greater inclusion of local communities in security
                                 strategies and improved cooperation between police and communities [<a href="#R24">24</a>, <a href="#R52">52</a>]. As stated by one NGO representative interviewed: ‘The police need to work with
                                 the communities to be effective in security. Security must be owned and driven by
                                 the community. Without the community it will never succeed.’ He further emphasized
                                 the need for an approach where various segments of the police and community members
                                 can come together to discuss the challenges facing communities, and together find
                                 out how to tackle them. He believed that such a problem-solving approach could be
                                 one way of bringing the police and the community closer together, or at least a way
                                 for the local police to get more accurate information about what was going on in the
                                 area. Further, it would make the police more accountable to the communities. Another
                                 NGO representative noted that many people were willing to cooperate with the state
                                 in, for example, anti-terrorism strategies, but ‘what we are lacking is the how and
                                 the style’.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e377">These views are in line with the stated aim of the CPCs and NK policies: to create
                                 a platform where communities and police work together to improve local security. However,
                                 many Kenyans are sceptical towards the two initiatives. A local resident in an urban
                                 area said he had been invited to become a NK member but had refused; he added that
                                 he did not believe in the NPS CPC model either. One member of a team that organized
                                 communities meetings to raise awareness and conduct trainings on the NK structure
                                 found the job difficult: ‘People refused to come to the meetings. Even the (already
                                 established) Nyumba Kumi members didn’t turn up’. Why is it, that despite voicing
                                 the need for community-friendly policing strategies, many citizens are sceptical and
                                 reluctant to engage in the two state-initiated COP models?
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e379">One explanation may be that the two COP models have not been properly grounded locally.
                                 There has been little training or follow-up with the communities, their leaders and
                                 the local police on the aim, function, objective and structure of CPCs and NK clusters.
                                 A study by the Kenyan NGO MUHURI on youth radicalization in coastal regions found
                                 that NK was well received in some coastal communities, but ‘some respondents claimed
                                 that the initiative is not well understood by the community. For it to work there
                                 must be proper sensitization about it’ ([<a href="#R24">24</a>], p.&nbsp;22). And a study of NK in Kayole in Nairobi concluded: ‘Due to lack of proper
                                 structures and guidelines on the Nyumba Kumi, there is a lot of confusion regarding
                                 the membership, roles and responsibility of the community.’ Several interviews and
                                 my own observation of COP sensitization meetings showed that CPCs and NK clusters
                                 had been established without proper introduction to the set-up, the aims and purpose
                                 of COP. There was misunderstanding and confusion, among civilians as well as police,
                                 concerning the criteria and process of selecting members, what membership entails,
                                 how to organize the COP structures, and the main principles behind the CPC and NK.
                                 The guidelines and written policies on CPC and the NK model were either not made available
                                 or were not followed at the local level. In another study of NK in Nakuru county,
                                 the majority of the respondents answered that they did not have the information on
                                 the policy meant to guide the NK model [<a href="#R53">53</a>].

                              <p id="d1e387">In response to this problem, the Directorate of Community Policing, Gender and Child
                                 Protection began holding sensitization meetings and trainings on the CPC structure
                                 with communities and local police in local communities. The Police Reform Working
                                 Group in Independent Medico Legal Unit (IMLU), a Kenyan NGO working to deepen people’s
                                 understanding of police reform, also conducts sensitization trainings on the CPC structure
                                 in some areas. One interviewee had conducted trainings on the NK structure in some
                                 areas in Nairobi. However, these efforts are small-scale, backed with few resources.
                                 Moreover, there is little or no monitoring or evaluation of the implementation of
                                 the two structures. In addition, local stakeholders and communities seemed to have
                                 had little influence in the development of the structures. As a result, many people
                                 see COP as a matter of top-down models imposed on them by a state apparatus they do
                                 not always trust.

                                 <i>Nyumba Kumi came about two years ago. They created a new structure which was very

                                    It also needs to be based on the need of the community, on community demand</i> [<a href="#R54">54</a>].

                              <p id="d1e397">Lack of proper implementation, misunderstandings and confusion may lead to unfortunate
                                 practices and misuse of the COP models. In 2017, the NPS published the Community Policing
                                 Information Booklet, aimed at informing the public and police officers about the CPC
                                 structure and clearing up some of the misunderstandings as to the purpose and aim
                                 of COP. The booklet emphasizes that COP should not be identified with vigilantism,
                                 coercion or extortion, as a replacement for village elders, or as spy rings, a parallel
                                 security system, political forums, employment or other activities that contravene
                                 the law ([<a href="#R25">25</a>], pp.&nbsp;14–16)—all of these being problems that had arisen in several places.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e402">A common view in the areas visited for this study, in relation to the CPCs as well
                                 as NK, is that COP serves primarily as methods of surveillance and intelligence gathering
                                 for the state and the police. Many people consider those actively involved in the
                                 COP models to be police informants—a role with definite negative connotations in Kenya.
                                 A CBO representative put it this way: ‘When you are a Nyumba Kumi member you are a
                                 spy. They (the community) call it a spy for the government’. An NK member found that
                                 people in her community were sceptical of her participation in the cluster. ‘The community
                                 sees you as a snitch’ (…). People think you are a police informant’. A police officer
                                 further explained: ‘Here, being an informant is despised. (…) People working with
                                 the police are seen as un-socialized’. One NK member explained that if people see
                                 you reporting to the police, ‘it spoils the relationship between you and your community’.
                                 That COP initiatives are seen as systems for the state and the police to conduct surveillance
                                 is a clear indication of the widespread mistrust and gap between the state and the
                                 public. Many people have negative experiences from previous encounters with the state,
                                 with the police in particular. Here it is important to note that the end of the reporting
                                 line for NK is the President’s Office; in the NPS CPC structure, it is the Police
                                 IG. Indeed, in practice the two COP initiatives may serve as a means of gathering
                                 intelligence for the police and the state; moreover, the focus on communities and
                                 police identifying and solving problems together seems less emphasised during implementation.
                                 The NK trainer interviewed acknowledged that cluster members do not necessarily know
                                 if and what actions are taken after the meetings. ‘The problem with Nyumba Kumi is
                                 that you don’t know if something will be done with issues, whether there is a follow-up.
                                 The purpose is (only) to notify’. How the police understand, treat and use the information
                                 emerging from the COP forums is then of great importance for police-public trust.
                                 At the community level, many people are generally unwilling to provide information
                                 to the police, fearing that police officers may violate the principle of confidentiality.
                                 Several interviewees mentioned instances where police officers had leaked information;
                                 moreover, this issue was taken up by community members in almost all seven COP sensitization
                                 meetings observed in connection with this study. For example, in return for bribes,
                                 police officers have revealed the identity of individuals who reported cases, putting
                                 these persons at risk of retaliation and reprisals from the perpetrators or others
                                 with a stake in the case. One NK member said there had been incidents where: 
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e404">
                                 <i>people who share information are at risk of being targeted. There is no confidentiality.
                                    The people who make a complaint, for example regarding criminals, might end up having
                                    descriptions of themselves given out and being targeted.</i> 
                                 
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e409">A survey conducted in Nairobi and Kisumu counties by Transparency International Kenya
                                 in 2015–2016 found that nine out of ten respondents answered that they did not proactively
                                 share information with the police about an issue or a concern in their community ([<a href="#R52">52</a>], p.&nbsp;45). Group discussions conducted in the same study revealed that respondents
                                 were reluctant to share vital information with the police due to instances where information
                                 had been relayed back to the culprits, to the detriment of the informant [<a href="#R52">52</a>]. When individual police officers violate the principle of confidentiality, that
                                 naturally has an impact on police-public trust, in turn negatively affecting the implementation
                                 of COP efforts. Further, filing complaints against the police, or advocating for police
                                 accountability in COP forums, may prove equally risky.

                              <p id="d1e426">Low confidentiality means a weak foundation for building partnerships. Due to negative
                                 views about individuals engaging in COP forums, local COP members risk accusations
                                 and retaliations from their own communities. Confidentiality breaches by police officers,
                                 as well civilian COP members, make the security situation even more difficult for
                                 COP members. An NK member explained that it is hard to recruit members to the clusters,
                                 because volunteers cannot be expected to put their lives at risk. At a sensitization
                                 meeting in one village, insecurity for COP members was identified as a main problem;
                                 and the CPC members themselves stressed the need for stronger security apparatus and
                                 measures around them. However, if the COP forums were less focused on intelligence
                                 gathering and providing information on specific criminal cases, and more steered towards
                                 collectively mapping and creating local solutions to overall insecurities in the communities,
                                 being part of a COP structure would not entail the same degree of risk.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e428">Another factor identified during the fieldwork was that civilians were misusing their
                                 COP membership to increase or maintain their own power. As mentioned, there were misunderstanding
                                 and confusion at the local level concerning structural and organizational aspects
                                 of the implementation of the two models. This created opportunities for misuse, not
                                 only for the police, but also for civilian members as well as community leaders. Nepotism
                                 and tribalism are common in many societal, economic and political processes in Kenya,
                                 and came into to play in the selection of COP forum members. According to NK policies,
                                 cluster members are to be democratically elected in biannual elections ([<a href="#R50">50</a>], pp.&nbsp;10–11). And the CPC guidelines specifically state that members are to represent
                                 different segments and groups in the community. However, in several case areas, the
                                 local COP members were appointed by the community chief, rather than the community
                                 electing their own representatives. A community member raised this issue in a sensitization
                                 meeting, saying that CPC members had been ‘selected through nepotism’. Several interviewees
                                 in another area claimed that the local chief had appointed the local NK members, all
                                 of whom were people in his inner circle. This supports the findings from a study in
                                 Nakuru, where more than half of the respondents answered that democracy in electing
                                 NK-initiative leaders was low or very low [<a href="#R53">53</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e436">Moreover, a former NK member interviewed for this study said that the chief used the
                                 NK structure to promote his own agenda: ‘issues get pressure whenever the chief is
                                 willing to give them pressure’. He described the NK meetings as merely playing to
                                 the gallery; further, that the chief would bribe members to report that the cluster
                                 was working well and that it had reduced the level of crime in that area.

                              <p id="d1e438">These are examples of how political or personal agendas overshadow the pillars of
                                 community partnerships and a collective approach to problem identification and solving.
                                 As many community members are in no position to hold local powerholders and leaders
                                 of COP forums accountable, and there are no proper oversight mechanisms for the two
                                 COP structures, local powerholders can appoint members, organize and run the COP forums
                                 according to their own personal agendas—which are not necessarily in the interest
                                 of the community as a whole. Another study of NK in Kayala, in Nairobi county, also
                                 showed that NK was seen as a way for village elders and leaders to promote their own
                                 interests rather than those of the community, and that the lack of effective accountability
                                 channels made it easier for people to take advantage of the system [<a href="#R54">54</a>]. In several areas, there were also reports of civilian CPC and NK members misusing
                                 the COP models to distort, harass and ‘police’—even to legitimize ‘arrests’—of other
                                 local residents. When this was mentioned in COP sensitization meetings observed in
                                 connection with this study, the trainer from the Directorate of Community Policing
                                 explained to the COP members and the police that only the police have the authority
                                 to make arrests, and discouraged civilian members from engaging in such practices,
                                 which could also entail considerable risks to personal security. In the early phases
                                 of CPC and NK implementation, civilian members were provided with COP identity cards
                                 for documentation. However, these were misused to legitimatize patrols, arrests and
                                 harassment of co-citizens, therefore such ID cards are no longer issued.

                              <p id="d1e446">In addition to breaches of confidentiality, interviewees identified several other
                                 in-house problems that had a negative impact on police-public relations. Factors like
                                 working conditions, resources and training of Kenyan police officers hinder the implementation
                                 of the police reform and the two COP models. The public often evaluate the police
                                 forces in terms of their response time and effectiveness, and this influences both
                                 relations and trust ([<a href="#R33">33</a>], p.&nbsp;66). In Kenya, as elsewhere, it is hard for the police to meet all the expectations
                                 of the public. For instance, in one rural village, local police officers explained
                                 that they did not have a functional vehicle at their disposal. They were often dependent
                                 on the public to pay for their transport fares involved in conducting their work.
                                 In another village, the local police officers complained that they had to pay for
                                 transport out of their own pockets. Other police stations were unable to pay for fuel
                                 [<a href="#R52">52</a>]. In Kenya, many police stations, police posts and patrol bases lack the equipment
                                 and resources needed to be able to fulfil their duties properly.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e454">The working and living conditions of Kenyan police officers are generally harsh. Although
                                 the state provides housing, availability is a challenge. Often, several officers and
                                 their families must live together in cramped spaces in housing of low standard [<a href="#R52">52</a>]. Many police stations are poorly equipped and in bad shape. ICT usage is low; the
                                 station events log for registration of cases is a physical book, not yet a digitalized
                                 system. Effectiveness is also affected by the low density of police officers, who
                                 work long hours [<a href="#R52">52</a>]. Recent years have seen an upscaling in the recruitment of new police officers in
                                 Kenya in order to meet the UN police-civilian ratio of 1:450 [<a href="#R55">55</a>]; however, the actual number of officers working at local police stations varies
                                 from area to area. During one of the COP sensitization meetings, local police officers
                                 claimed that they were altogether only 26 police officers, from both Kenya Police
                                 Service and Administration Police Service, serving a population of 500 000. In 2012,
                                 the Usalama Reforms Forum published the report ‘Communities and their Police Stations’,
                                 which studied 21 police stations across Kenya. The report revealed large variation
                                 in standards in terms of facilities, equipment, organizational structure and staff
                                 among the police stations, police posts and patrol bases. It recommended that the
                                 government review all police stations, in order to determine whether they were fit
                                 for their purpose, and to ensure compliance with the minimum standards required to
                                 perform their core functions [<a href="#R56">56</a>].

                              <p id="d1e468">Lack of proper training of police officers is another issue. In 2014, basic police
                                 training in Kenya was cut from 15 to 9 months, and the concept of community policing
                                 has not been properly integrated into this training. A central element in mainstreaming
                                 police reforms involves reviewing and updating the police curriculum and training.
                                 An NGO representative spoke in favour of police training in ‘how to connect with communities
                                 and how to build trust with the communities’. Further, a police officer emphasised
                                 that the basic training curriculum is outdated: ‘The training is still based on the
                                 colonial model of training. The training was and still is to protect the ruling class’.
                                 Bringing the police training and curriculum in line with the police reform is an essential
                                 step towards ensuring a better understanding of what people-centred policing entails
                                 and how policies and models, including community policing, can be translated into
                                 everyday police practices and methods.

                              <p id="d1e470">However, the gap between what is taught at police colleges, on the one hand, and,
                                 on the other hand, existing police culture and practices on the ground may also prove
                                 a challenge. Longstanding internal ‘unofficial rules’ that police officers follow
                                 in the field is not necessarily in line with the police training. Training on good
                                 practices may have little effect in changing police behaviour unless followed up by
                                 the leadership in police districts, or if it conflicts with other incentives such
                                 as possibilities for promotions [<a href="#R57">57</a>]. Another issue is the gap between senior and junior officers. Some police officers
                                 interviewed explained that the younger officers often have a higher level of general
                                 education than their seniors, and with different views on policing methods. As police
                                 organizations are highly hierarchical and rank-based, it is difficult for junior and
                                 newly recruited personnel to bring forward new ideas, unless supported by their leaders.
                                 As two young police officers explained: 
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e475">
                                 <i>We (junior officers) have a very different view. It was difficult for us to take education
                                    on the side. Our senior leaders said either you work or you take your education—we
                                    would have to choose. They don’t understand the benefits from it (education). I think
                                    in 5 to 10 years, things will be different. The old generation is still there today,
                                    we’ll have to wait until they are gone.</i>

                              <p id="d1e480">However, the junior-senior gap may take other forms as well. In a sensitization meeting
                                 in one village, a community representative spoke of how junior police officers exhibited
                                 violent behaviour towards community members. He suggested that junior officers should
                                 patrol along with senior officers who are more experienced in relating to and communicating
                                 with the community, to learn from them.

                                    <p id="d1e485">The two COP models are, at least on paper, aimed at bringing the police and the public
                                       closer together. Achieving the right degree of closeness versus distance to the population
                                       is a balancing act: ‘There are endless stories about the tension between this need
                                       for a close relationships to the societal space which is the object of policing- and
                                       the need for distance that shall ensure ‘discipline’, the ultimate orientation of
                                       police work towards the supposed ends of the state’ ([<a href="#R1">1</a>], p.&nbsp;23). During the colonial period in Kenya, the British recruited to the police
                                       forces individuals from communities seen as less hostile towards the regime; this
                                       recruitment was highly ethnicized [<a href="#R4">4</a>]. Moreover, ’(…) police officers were not allowed to serve in their home areas. This
                                       only served to cement the view of many people that the police was an alien unit’ ([<a href="#R4">4</a>], p.&nbsp;591). There are still traces of this system in the Kenyan police today. Police
                                       officers are deployed on a rotation system, preferably changing duty station every
                                       five years—one reason being to prevent them from becoming too embedded in local communities.
                                       The rotation system can be seen as a way of trying to ensure impartiality and neutrality
                                       among deployed police officers. However, tribalism is a central element in the social
                                       and political construction of Kenyan communities, and tribe and politics are closely
                                       interconnected. In the rural villages visited in Kisumu and Siaya counties, most police
                                       officers did not belong to the same tribe as the majority of the local population.
                                       In such cases, tribalism and political tensions between tribes can fuel community
                                       reluctance to trust the police and cooperate with them. In that sense, the police
                                       rotation deployment system may stand in the way of COP initiatives encouraging partnerships
                                       and collaboration. The rotation system also represents an opportunity for political
                                       leaders to govern and control areas of opposing tribes, political parties, views and
                                       alliances, and to steer elections [<a href="#R58">58</a>]. In addition, all police officers are not necessarily interested in getting to know
                                       a new area where they are only to spend a few years. A senior police officer in one
                                       rural village also pointed out that it takes time to get to understand a new local
                                       context.

                                    <p id="d1e499">Lastly, low police salaries impede the building of police-public trust. In fact, the
                                       Ransley Report recommended higher salaries and a greater police management focus on
                                       salaries [<a href="#R37">37</a>]. Many police officers must depend on bribes to provide for their families and make
                                       ends meet. Low payment increases police vulnerability to corruption and makes officers
                                       susceptible to manipulations by more powerful segments of the society. One police
                                       interviewee conducting trainings on COP found it difficult to encourage police officers
                                       to engage with local communities:

                                       <i>A challenge is that the police don’t want to connect with the communities, because
                                          then it is harder to get bribes. It is harder to ask for money, bribes and harass

                                       institutional problem. Deniz Kocak argues that basic bureaucratic police professionalism
                                       and capacities are necessary conditions to establish community policing ([<a href="#R60">60</a>], p.&nbsp;2). Maurice Punch applies the metaphors of ‘rotten apples’, ‘rotten barrels’
                                       and ‘rotten orchards’ to police institutions [<a href="#R61">61</a>], nothing that the police themselves often employ the ‘rotten apple’ metaphor for
                                       a ‘deviant cop who slips into bad ways and contaminates the other essentially good
                                       officers—which is an individualistic, human failure model of deviance’ ([<a href="#R61">61</a>], p.&nbsp;173). In a ‘rotten barrel’, the deviance spreads to a certain unit or segment
                                       of the police. A solution to rotten apples and barrels is to remove and replace them.
                                       With ‘rotten orchards’, however, malpractice has become systemic, perhaps even encouraged
                                       or protected by certain elements in the system: ‘at certain times and in certain contexts,
                                       police deviance becomes virtually institutionalized, is affected by and affects other
                                       parts of the criminal justice system, may be related to wider influences in the broader
                                       enviroment and leads to what I call “system failure”’ ([<a href="#R61">61</a>], p.&nbsp;172). Plagued by endemic corruption, structural and management challenges, the
                                       police institution in Kenya may be characterized as such a ‘system failure’. That
                                       does not mean that all police officers are ‘bad’—on the contrary, some civilian interviewees
                                       said that they do trust and cooperate with certain local police officers. The challenge
                                       can rather be seen as the system which facilitates, encourages, protects and rewards
                                       certain deviant behaviours and practices.

                                    <p id="d1e533">This problem concerns not only the police, but the justice system as a whole. Several
                                       interviewees, both civilian and police, emphasized that the justice and court system
                                       is seen as weak and corrupt. In turn, low confidence in the justice system and rule
                                       of law contributes to reluctance to report cases to the police or share information
                                       with them in the first place. As a result, the police have a hard time performing
                                       their duties, for example getting witnesses to testify in court. One CBO representative
                                       explained that sometimes local police officers even deem the justice system so corrupt
                                       and insufficient that they decide to take justice into their own hands. Punch argues
                                       that to be able to explain how system failures occur and are maintained, a range of
                                       mechanisms within the organization as well as its wider environment must be taken
                                       into account.

                                    <p id="d1e535"><i>In an organization designed to uphold the law, the law can be broken because control,
                                          supervision, checks and balances, monitoring, audits and leadership may all fail to
                                          function adequately while cultural and institutional pressures promote and support

                                    <p id="d1e542">As noted, the challenges of implementing COP are closely connected to the wider socio-economic
                                       and political context. For instance, that civilians as well as police officers may
                                       use the COP models for their own or tribal gain, and that political tensions stand
                                       in the way. Tribalism, nepotism and corruption are not specific to COP initiatives,
                                       but embedded in the overall social, political, economic structures at the local and
                                       national levels. The police represent only one piece in a larger political game for
                                       power and resources, so police reform or community policing models alone cannot to
                                       be expected to challenge or change such dynamics and systems. Reform must be a part
                                       of a larger state building process involving wider public and political reforms and
                                       developments.

                              <p id="d1e547">Finally, perhaps the most significant challenge to proper implementation of the two
                                 COP models, concerns the mandate of the police in Kenya and the role they are set
                                 to fulfil in society. The main police ‘clientele’ steers how policing is carried out.
                                 As Jackson and colleagues emphasize, the degree of trust in the police hinges not
                                 only on the effectiveness and competence of the police, but also involves aspects
                                 such as police commitment, the extent of which the police care about the people they
                                 serve, and their capacity to understand the needs of the community and are willing
                                 to address these needs ([<a href="#R33">33</a>], p.&nbsp;66). Research on procedural justice shows that how citizens assess the fairness
                                 of the police and justice system is highly dependent on how the police interact with
                                 the population and how police officers execute their power [<a href="#R62">62</a>]. In turn, the way police officers behave and view the public can be understood in
                                 light of two different ‘police paradigms’ of the function and role of the police,
                                 especially to whom the police are held accountable [<a href="#R63">63</a>]. On the one hand, the main mandate of the police may be to protect the state: as
                                 a result, members of the public are often excluded from partnerships [<a href="#R63">63</a>]. This may also be an ideological cover for more repressive functions of social control
                                 [<a href="#R64">64</a>]. In the second paradigm, the main task of the police is defined as being to protect
                                 and serve the public ([<a href="#R63">63</a>], pp.&nbsp;78–79). In practice, there is not necessarily a strict division between the
                                 two paradigms ([<a href="#R63">63</a>], p.&nbsp;79) and police systems encompass both functions to varying degrees [<a href="#R2">2</a>, <a href="#R65">65</a>]. This difference between the two functions is reflected in how policing is carried
                                 out ([<a href="#R63">63</a>], p.&nbsp;79). To return to the case of Kenya, one police officer interviewed said that
                                 some of his police colleagues ‘have a superiority complex. They do not engage or mingle
                                 with civilians. The communities feel they are looked down upon.’ One reason for this
                                 behaviour, he argued, was the focus on ‘tackling the enemy’ which is taught during
                                 police training. Some community members interviewed for this study confirmed this
                                 view: they feel that the police regard them as enemies and treat them as such. Such
                                 police behaviours and the role the police are trained to perform indicate a heavy
                                 state-protection mandate, with less emphasis on providing a service to the public.
                                 Grasping the role and function of the police today also requires understanding the
                                 social and political responsibilities of the police in their various historical manifestations
                                 ([<a href="#R63">63</a>], p.&nbsp;78). As noted, the police institution in Kenya has its origins in the colonial
                                 period, where the police were to protect the powerholders from rebellion against the
                                 regime. The current police reform, endorsing a people-centred police, represent a
                                 push for a paradigm shift from this traditional system. Such transitions require political
                                 will.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e583">Alice Hills argues that the police in many African countries are in fact accountable
                                 solely to their presidents ([<a href="#R66">66</a>], p.&nbsp;403); further, that police commissioners in these countries are the president’s
                                 point of access to the police institution ([<a href="#R66">66</a>], p.&nbsp;407). Citing examples from several presidents in Africa, including Kenya’s former
                                 President Kibaki, she hold that presidents do not want a police answerable to parliamentary
                                 committees or judicial enquiries: they ‘value the police as a tool for enforcing political
                                 decisions, maintaining order, regulating activities and regime representation’ ([<a href="#R66">66</a>], p.&nbsp;407). In such contexts, Hills argues, security sector reform is unrealistic,
                                 as state leaders have little to gain from democratizing the police: on the contrary,
                                 that would reduce their personal power ([<a href="#R66">66</a>], p.&nbsp;406). Hence, proper implementation of police reforms and changes in police practices
                                 relies on whether the president or other powerholders can benefit from it or not.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e597">The stated intention behind the Kenyan police reform and the two COP models—to transform
                                 the police institution into a people-centred police with greater public accountability—may
                                 not serve the interests of the president, or other powerholders. On the other hand,
                                 closer police-public coordination for gathering information may yield valuable intelligence
                                 that can protect the regime. This is in line with what many interviewees for this
                                 study have said: that COP is just another platform for powerholders to collect intelligence
                                 and conduct surveillance of the population, in order to maintain or increase their
                                 power. For many Kenyans, the main pillars of the NPS COP—problem-solving, partnership
                                 and police transformation—are simply words on paper. As long as the main function
                                 of the police is to protect the regime from its own citizenry, political and economic
                                 interests will continue to steer the police reform and the two COP models. As Tyler
                                 has put it, ‘Consequently, legitimacy is the most promising framework for discussing
                                 changing the goals of policing and moving from a police force model to a police service
                                 model’ ([<a href="#R67">67</a>], p.&nbsp;29). As long as tribal politics (including the president’s personal power) and
                                 the police are two sides of the same coin, transforming the Kenyan police into a legitimate,
                                 democratic and people-centred police service seems unlikely. As Kocak points out,
                                 policing cannot be separated from its political context, and in order to promote and
                                 establish a community-oriented approach to policing that is in line with good governance,
                                 a transformative context of democratization is necessary ([<a href="#R60">60</a>], p.&nbsp;35). He adds that the necessary conditions for establishing community policing
                                 are ‘a police organization with, at least, basic professional bureaucratic capacities,
                                 a genuine commitment and political will on behalf of local authorities to promote
                                 and push for its implementation, and a concept or approach to community policing that
                                 actually matters to the respective local context and its realities’ ([<a href="#R60">60</a>], p.&nbsp;35). These conditions are not yet in place in Kenya.

                              <p id="d1e611">On paper, the police reform underway in Kenya represents a paradigm shift towards
                                 a people-centred police. Enhancing police-public relations and trust are at the core
                                 of the reform. Two community policing (COP) models, the National Police Service’s
                                 <i>Community Policing Structure and the President’s Office’ Nyumba Kumi</i> (NK) model, have been developed in order to bridge the gap between the police and
                                 local communities. The NK model involves anchoring community policing at the household
                                 level in clusters, in order to improve relations and communications among community
                                 members themselves as well as with the police. The NPS model is structured through
                                 Community Policing Committees (CPC), consisting of members representing different
                                 segments of the community and local police. In their meetings, CPC members are, collectively,
                                 to identify and solve problems at the community level, and coordinate activities,
                                 programmes and trainings to promote security.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e616">In practice, however, proper implementation of NK and the CPCs has proven difficult.
                                 Observations and interviews in local communities in urban and rural parts in Western,
                                 Mid- and Eastern Kenya between 2016 and 2018, with community organizations, community
                                 representatives and police officers, show considerable scepticism towards the two
                                 COP models. This article has identified and analysed some main reasons why so many
                                 people are reluctant to engage in COP, in order to explain the failure of the two
                                 COP initiatives to improve police-public trust and cooperation.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e618">Firstly, in the communities visited, the two initiatives had not been properly anchored
                                 at the local level among community members, their leaders and the police. As a result,
                                 confusion and misunderstandings arose, as to the set-up, goal and purpose of the two
                                 COP structures. Moreover, local communities saw the models as top-down approaches
                                 imposed on them from above—not as initiatives driven and organized by the communities
                                 themselves, which would have given the communities greater agency and ownership in
                                 the processes. As a result of uncertainties regarding the policies and guidelines
                                 for implementation, as well as the lack of oversight and accountability mechanism,
                                 civilians and police COP members have in some cases misused the two structures for
                                 personal gain and/or to accumulate and secure power.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e620">Secondly, police-public trust and implementation of the COP models have been impeded
                                 by in-house problems within the police system, such as lack of human and economic
                                 resources, poor working conditions, training, management and leadership at various
                                 levels in the police. Moreover, the police reform, including people-centred policing
                                 and COP policies, has not been translated into everyday police practices on the ground
                                 nor properly integrated into the police training and curriculum.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e622">That is connected to the third point: the role and function of the police, and the
                                 question of who the police are to serve. Ever since Kenya’s colonial period, the mandate
                                 of the police has predominantly been to serve and protect the powerholders. Also today,
                                 politics and the police are two sides of the same coin; the president and other political
                                 figures have great personal power, also over the police. Powerholders have little
                                 to gain if the police forces are transformed into a truly people-centred, democratic
                                 and accountable system. In fact, the two COP models represent a way for powerholders
                                 to monitor and maintain surveillance of local communities as a strategy for securing
                                 the regime and their own personal power.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e624">Interviewees reiterated the common perception in the areas visited: COP merely represents
                                 a method for the state to ‘spy’ on its population. Without political will and power
                                 to ensure proper implementation, the policies will remain merely words on paper. Moreover,
                                 societal dynamics such as tribalism, nepotism and corruption lie at the root of many
                                 political, economic and social processes in Kenya, influencing rule of law and the
                                 justice system as a whole. Police reform and community policing models alone can hardly
                                 be expected to challenge this. What is needed is a wider state-building process with
                                 deep-going public and political reforms, developments and democratization. As of now,
                                 the basic conditions for implementation of the two COP models for the benefit of the
                                 general population in Kenya are simply not there. People-centric policing and greater
                                 police-public trust remain a long-term vision rather than a realistic goal for the
                                 coming years. For the police in Kenya to become the ‘people’s police’, the road is
                                 indeed long and bumpy, with many hazards and detours ahead.
