                  <p class="first" id="d1e58">A reform is underway in Kenya, aimed at transforming the police organization into
                     a people- centred police service. Among other things, this involves enhancing police-public
                     trust and partnerships through community policing (COP). Two state-initiated COP models
                     have been implemented: the National Police Service’s Community Policing Structure,
                     and the Nyumba Kumi model of the President’s Office. On paper, police reform and the
                     two COP models would appear to have the potential to improve police-public cooperation.
                     In practice, however, implementation has proven difficult. Interviews and meetings
                     with local community organizations, community representatives and police officers
                     in urban and rural parts of Kenya indicate that scepticism towards the two COP models
                     is common, as is refusal to engage in them. But why is this so? Why are these two
                     COP models unsuccessful in enhancing police-public trust and cooperation? This article
                     analyses how various contextual factors—such as conflicting socio-economic and political
                     interests at the community and national levels, institutional challenges within the
                     police, the overall role and mandate of the police in Kenya, and a top-down approach
                     to COP—impede the intended police paradigm shift.

            <p id="d1e75">The police are highly dependent on collaboration and information from citizens in
               order to provide and maintain security within a state. ‘Without at least partial collaboration
               of citizens, police work is impossible’ ([<a href="#R1">1</a>], p. 23). If the police do not have the support of the public, core police tasks
               such as investigation, evidence gathering and prevention become more difficult. However,
               effective cooperation between the police and the public requires that the police enjoy
               a certain minimum level of trust among the population [<a href="#R2">2</a>]. In Kenya, public trust and confidence in the police is generally low [<a href="#R3">3</a>, <a href="#R4">4</a>, <a href="#R5">5</a>, <a href="#R6">6</a>], for various reasons. Firstly, in many African states, the police forces were developed
               in order to secure European colonial regimes by coercive means ([<a href="#R1">1</a>], p. 21). Much has changed since independence, but traces of the colonial and post-colonial
               state are still evident in many African police systems today, as the nature and purpose
               of policing have remained the same ([<a href="#R7">7</a>], p.&nbsp;69). The Kenyan police system was established by and for the British colonialists,
               mainly to protect colonial interests [<a href="#R4">4</a>, <a href="#R8">8</a>]. After Kenyan independence in 1963, the mandate of the police remained largely unchanged:
               to secure the interests of those in power [<a href="#R4">4</a>, <a href="#R9">9</a>, <a href="#R10">10</a>]. A second factor that contributes to lack of trust in the police is the widespread
               practice of individual police officers taking advantage of their position for personal
               gain. Public opinion polls rank the police the most corrupt state institution in the
               country [<a href="#R9">9</a>, <a href="#R11">11</a>, <a href="#R12">12</a>]. Moreover, out of 180 countries, Kenya was number 144 on Transparency International’s
               corruption perception index for 2018 [<a href="#R13">13</a>]. Many members of the public see the police as a hazard, not a protecting force or
               a service to the population. In a study conducted in ten urban and rural communities
               in Kenya in 2011, the police were identified as a major source of insecurity [<a href="#R14">14</a>]. Another report, based on data collected from 500 households among urban poor in
               South Eastleigh in Nairobi in 2015, found that 26% of the violence experienced by
               these households had been carried out by the police [<a href="#R15">15</a>]. Further, some crimes are also directly or indirectly attributed to the police [<a href="#R4">4</a>]—with police officers contributing to crime rather to its prevention and detection
               [<a href="#R3">3</a>]. The post-election violence in 2007 and 2017 also affected police-public relations.
               The violence in the wake of the 2017 national elections were particularly bloody;
               according to the official inquiry: ‘the Kenyan police conducted themselves unprofessionally,
               used excessive force, and were woefully ineffective in protecting life and property’
               ([<a href="#R16">16</a>], p.&nbsp;11).
            </p>
            <p id="d1e146">In addition to high levels of crime and violence in general, Kenya is struggling to
               counter violent extremism. In particular, the Somali jihadi group al-Shabaab regularly
               carries out terrorist attacks in Kenya, and several Kenyans have been recruited to
               al-Shabaab [<a href="#R17">17</a>]. As is the case also in other countries, the Kenyan state has responded to terrorism
               with top-down, militarized measures. This harsh anti-terrorism line has damaged police-public
               relations even further [<a href="#R18">18</a>]. The measures employed by the state have been heavily criticized: the police have
               been accused of extrajudicial killings, disappearances, harassment, ill treatment
               and unlawful detentions—as well as misusing the anti-terror law to collect bribes
               and loot houses [<a href="#R19">19</a>, <a href="#R20">20</a>, <a href="#R21">21</a>, <a href="#R22">22</a>, <a href="#R23">23</a>, <a href="#R24">24</a>]
            </p>
            <p id="d1e173">The Kenyan police system has long been characterized by crime control through reactive
               policing practices, widely condemned by Kenyan society [<a href="#R4">4</a>, <a href="#R25">25</a>]. The reform currently underway seeks to address this by improving police-public
               relations through initiatives such as community policing (COP)—a concept which has
               become popular among donors, governments, police and policymakers worldwide. ‘So popular
               is the concept with politicians, city managers, and the general public, that few police
               chiefs want to be caught without some program they can call community policing’ ([<a href="#R26">26</a>], p.&nbsp;27). However, COP as such is vague, interpreted and practised differently, with
               no consensus on what it entails [<a href="#R27">27</a>]. Despite the many COP projects initiated around the world, agreed definitions of
               what community policing is and what it is not do not exist [<a href="#R28">28</a>]. The concept is ‘bedevilled by definitional problems’ ([<a href="#R29">29</a>], p.&nbsp;167) and ‘can be transformed chameleon-like into whatever its practitioners
               want it to be’ ([<a href="#R30">30</a>], p.&nbsp;71). On the one hand it can be used as a tool for the state to gather intelligence
               to protect itself from its own population and for elites to maintain their power.
               On the other hand, COP can serve as a way for the police to improve relations with
               the public so as to provide better services, security and safety for and with the
               populace. The latter understanding of COP is dominant in the academic literature today.
               In practice, however, approaches and implementation vary widely. Some COP models aim
               for better effectiveness in terms of quality, responsiveness and accountability for
               police services; others focus on greater engagement with local communities for community-based
               solutions to local challenges ([<a href="#R27">27</a>], p.&nbsp;4). Each model comes with its own set of activities, goals, expectations [<a href="#R27">27</a>], with differing content, impact and challenges as to implementation. Although COP
               is primarily a Western concept, it is increasingly implemented in countries of the
               Global South—often encouraged by international actors mostly from the Global North
               [<a href="#R29">29</a>]. Despite the positive perceptions of COP, there is little evidence of its actual
               impact and effectiveness, especially as regards its export to non-Western societies
               [<a href="#R29">29</a>]. This is reflected in the literature: empirically based studies of COP approaches
               and police-public relations tend to focus on Western contexts [<a href="#R27">27</a>, <a href="#R31">31</a>, <a href="#R32">32</a>, <a href="#R33">33</a>, <a href="#R34">34</a>]. There is a clear need for better understanding of the practices and meanings of
               COP across a broader range of contexts.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e225">Policing in Africa is still understudied and ‘ethnographic work on public police bureaucracies
               in Africa is just beginning’ ([<a href="#R35">35</a>], p.&nbsp;1). This article seeks to contribute to the literature on policing in Africa
               as well as the evolving debates on the role of COP in enhancing police-public relations.
               In Kenya, two state-initiated COP initiatives for improving police-public relations
               have been developed: the National Police Service’ ‘Community Policing Structure’ and
               the ‘Nyumba Kumi’ model led by the President’s Office. However, moving from policy
               to practice has proven difficult. Why have these two COP models proven unsuccessful?
               To answer this, empirical material was gathered during fieldtrips to urban areas in
               Nairobi and Mombasa, and rural areas in Kisumu and Siaya counties between January
               2016 and May 2018. These areas were selected in order to capture experiences across
               urban and rural settings as well as regions—Eastern, Mid- and Western Kenya—with different
               local contexts. The findings cannot claim to be representative of the implementation
               of the two COP models throughout the whole country. Kenya is vast and diverse entity,
               each county and sub-county having its own characteristics in terms of demographics,
               culture, livelihood, crime and political alliances. However, the study has identified
               some major structural obstacles to proper implementation, closely linked to overall
               national and programme-related challenges not solely dependent on local conditions.

            <p id="d1e230">A total of 35 individual and group interviews were conducted with representatives
               from community-based organizations (CBOs), non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and
               community members in Mombasa town and in the Majengo and Eastleigh areas of Nairobi.
               These included representatives from women’s, youth, human rights and religious organizations,
               and members of the two COP forums. To gain insights and experiences from rural areas,
               observation was conducted in COP sensitization meetings held by the Directorate of
               Community Policing, Gender and Child Protection for local communities and police in
               seven villages in Kisumu and Siaya counties. In order to capture police perspectives
               and experiences, individual and group interviews were conducted with sixteen police
               officers stationed in Mombasa, Nairobi, Kisumu, Siaya, Garissa and Nakuru counties.
               Some of these were individual interviews; some participated in a group interview held
               in connection with a police training in Nairobi. Due to the sensitivity of the topic,
               and the possible implications of interviewee claims and statements, given the current
               security context, individuals and organizations who have contributed to the study
               have been anonymized.

            <p id="d1e235">Despite some positive developments occurring within the police system the last decades,
               the need to establish better police-public relations and trust in Kenya is still dire.
               Work on the current police reform began in the early 2000s, and has now become the
               country’s largest and most complex public-sector restructuring attempt since independence
               from Britain in 1963 ([<a href="#R6">6</a>], p.&nbsp;2). The post-election violence in 2007 pushed the police reform higher up on
               the agenda, and the National Task Force on Police Reforms was established. The Task
               Force produced a report, ‘the Ransley Report’, with a roadmap for the reform [<a href="#R36">36</a>, <a href="#R37">37</a>]. The following years brought about several structural changes within the police.
               In connection with the redrafting of the 2010 Constitution, the Kenya Police Service
               and the Administration Police Service were joined together under one umbrella; the
               National Police Service (NPS). The NPS Commission and other oversight bodies such
               as the Internal Affairs Unit (IAU) and the Independent Policing Oversight Authority
               (IPOA) were also established. In 2015, when Joseph Boinett was sworn in as new Inspector
               General (IG) of the NPS, he stated that his goal was a people-centred police [<a href="#R38">38</a>], adding that the aim of the reformation process was to ‘transform the Kenya police
               and administration police into efficient effective and professional and accountable
               security agencies that Kenyans can trust for their safety and security’ [<a href="#R39">39</a>]. The establishment of the NPS represented a strategic shift towards a more service-oriented
               institution; among its main functions is to ‘foster and promote relationships with
               the broader society’ [<a href="#R40">40</a>]. Today the mission of the NPS is, according to its website, ‘To provide professional
               and people centred police service through community partnership and upholding rule
               of law for a safe and secure society’ [<a href="#R41">41</a>]. Clearly, enhancing police-public relationships and trust are central to Kenya’s
               current police reform, and community policing is to play a vital role.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e259">The NPS defines COP as follows: </p>
            <p id="d1e261">
               <i>Community Policing is the approach to policing that recognizes voluntary participation
                  of the local community in the maintenance of peace and which acknowledges that the
                  police need to be responsive to the communities and their needs, its key element being
                  joint problem identification and problem-solving, while respecting the different responsibilities
                  the police and the public have in the field of crime prevention and maintaining order</i> ([<a href="#R25">25</a>], p.&nbsp;1). 
            </p>
            <p id="d1e269">By using this definition, NPS has chosen to focus especially on the ‘soft’ aspects
               of policing, such as police responses to community needs, and collaborative problem-identification
               and problem-solving. It also highlights that both the public and the police play a
               role in crime prevention and maintaining peace and order—in line with the vision of
               moving from a police-centric to a more people-centric police.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e271">COP is not a new concept in Kenya. Several state and non-state actors have introduced
               various types of COP programmes aimed at bringing the police and the populace closer
               together [<a href="#R4">4</a>, <a href="#R42">42</a>]. Today, the most widely known COP initiatives in Kenya are the two above-mentioned
               state-initiated COP models: the NPS <i>Community Policing Structure</i>, and the <i>Nyumba Kumi model</i> led by the President’s Office. COP was originally launched by former President Mwai
               Kibaki in 2005, but the concept did not catch on at the time [<a href="#R25">25</a>]. In connection with the redrafting of the Constitution in 2010 and the shift from
               police force to police service, the concept of COP was revived. Today, the function
               and objectives of COP are emphasized and grounded in central documents such as the
               National Police Service Act [<a href="#R43">43</a>] and the National Police Service Standing Orders [<a href="#R44">44</a>].

               <p id="d1e298">The NPS COP model is structured through Community Policing Committees (CPC), from
                  sub-locations to county level under the County Policing Authority (CPA). These committees
                  consist of civilians and police who are to meet and report up to the next level/committee
                  in the chain [<a href="#R25">25</a>]. The chairperson of the CPCs is a civilian; the vice-chair is a member of the police
                  [<a href="#R25">25</a>]. According to the NPS COP guidelines, membership in CPCs is to be on voluntary basis,
                  with no reimbursement for participation. Civilian members can participate in a CPC
                  for two years, with one renewal possible [<a href="#R25">25</a>]. The idea behind the committees is for individuals representing different segments
                  of the community (youth/children, women/men, schools, business community, religious
                  groups, etc.) and the police to meet regularly, in order to identify and solve problems
                  at the community level and coordinate activities, programmes and trainings to promote
                  security. The main pillars of the NPS COP are problem solving, partnership and police
                  transformation [<a href="#R25">25</a>]. Further, problem solving entails a ‘joint process of addressing recurring security
                  problems within a community’; ‘partnership’ is defined as a collaborative effort with
                  the primary objective of determining security needs and policing priorities; and ‘police
                  transformation’ refers to ‘a fundamental shift from police-centric to people-centric
                  policing’ ([<a href="#R25">25</a>], pp.&nbsp;10–11).

               <p id="d1e318">After the al-Shabaab attack on Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi in 2013, President
                  Uhuru Kenyatta introduced a COP model called <i>Nyumba Kumi</i> (NK). Similar models are found in several other African countries, including Tanzania,
                  Rwanda, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, with varying results [<a href="#R45">45</a>, <a href="#R46">46</a>, <a href="#R47">47</a>, <a href="#R48">48</a>]. In Kenya, the NK model was introduced as a strategy for fighting terrorism and
                  insecurity by improving communication and cooperation between communities and their
                  police [<a href="#R49">49</a>]. <i>Nyumba Kumi</i> translates as ‘ten households’: however, in Kenya it is not limited to a fixed number
                  of households, but represents a cluster of people and organizations with shared aspirations
                  and locality [<a href="#R50">50</a>]. According to the guidelines for implementation: 
               </p>
               <p id="d1e345">
                  <i>Nyumba Kumi is a strategy of anchoring community policing at the household level or
                     any other generic cluster. These households can be in a residential court, in an estate,
                     a block of houses, a manyatta, a street, a market centre, a gated community, a village
                     or a bulla. The concept is aimed at bringing Kenyans together in clusters defined
                     by physical locations, felt needs and pursuit of common ideals: a safe, sustainable
                     and prosperous neighbourhood</i> ([<a href="#R50">50</a>], p.&nbsp;3). 
               </p>
               <p id="d1e353">The aim is for local residents to get to know each other better and to have a structure
                  for communication among themselves as well as with the local police. Local community
                  chiefs (civilians) lead the clusters and report to the local police on matters of
                  community security—the police are not to formally be members of these clusters. According
                  to the NK implementation guidelines, members are to be democratically elected for
                  a two-year period and are eligible for re-election [<a href="#R50">50</a>]. As with the CPC, participation in NK cluster is to be voluntary and the members
                  not reimbursed. NKs are not formally part of the NPS structure, but lie under the
                  auspices of the President’s Office.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e358">The existence of two COP models implemented by different actors at the same time has
                  created some confusion and tension as the two models are partly conflicting [<a href="#R51">51</a>]. Efforts are underway to merge the two concepts and place NK clusters under sub-locations
                  in the NPS COP structure, to give COP a grounding at the household level ([<a href="#R25">25</a>], p.&nbsp;32).

            <p id="d1e369">Kenyans have long been calling for greater inclusion of local communities in security
               strategies and improved cooperation between police and communities [<a href="#R24">24</a>, <a href="#R52">52</a>]. As stated by one NGO representative interviewed: ‘The police need to work with
               the communities to be effective in security. Security must be owned and driven by
               the community. Without the community it will never succeed.’ He further emphasized
               the need for an approach where various segments of the police and community members
               can come together to discuss the challenges facing communities, and together find
               out how to tackle them. He believed that such a problem-solving approach could be
               one way of bringing the police and the community closer together, or at least a way
               for the local police to get more accurate information about what was going on in the
               area. Further, it would make the police more accountable to the communities. Another
               NGO representative noted that many people were willing to cooperate with the state
               in, for example, anti-terrorism strategies, but ‘what we are lacking is the how and
               the style’.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e377">These views are in line with the stated aim of the CPCs and NK policies: to create
               a platform where communities and police work together to improve local security. However,
               many Kenyans are sceptical towards the two initiatives. A local resident in an urban
               area said he had been invited to become a NK member but had refused; he added that
               he did not believe in the NPS CPC model either. One member of a team that organized
               communities meetings to raise awareness and conduct trainings on the NK structure
               found the job difficult: ‘People refused to come to the meetings. Even the (already
               established) Nyumba Kumi members didn’t turn up’. Why is it, that despite voicing
               the need for community-friendly policing strategies, many citizens are sceptical and
               reluctant to engage in the two state-initiated COP models?
            </p>
            <p id="d1e379">One explanation may be that the two COP models have not been properly grounded locally.
               There has been little training or follow-up with the communities, their leaders and
               the local police on the aim, function, objective and structure of CPCs and NK clusters.
               A study by the Kenyan NGO MUHURI on youth radicalization in coastal regions found
               that NK was well received in some coastal communities, but ‘some respondents claimed
               that the initiative is not well understood by the community. For it to work there
               must be proper sensitization about it’ ([<a href="#R24">24</a>], p.&nbsp;22). And a study of NK in Kayole in Nairobi concluded: ‘Due to lack of proper
               structures and guidelines on the Nyumba Kumi, there is a lot of confusion regarding
               the membership, roles and responsibility of the community.’ Several interviews and
               my own observation of COP sensitization meetings showed that CPCs and NK clusters
               had been established without proper introduction to the set-up, the aims and purpose
               of COP. There was misunderstanding and confusion, among civilians as well as police,
               concerning the criteria and process of selecting members, what membership entails,
               how to organize the COP structures, and the main principles behind the CPC and NK.
               The guidelines and written policies on CPC and the NK model were either not made available
               or were not followed at the local level. In another study of NK in Nakuru county,
               the majority of the respondents answered that they did not have the information on
               the policy meant to guide the NK model [<a href="#R53">53</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e387">In response to this problem, the Directorate of Community Policing, Gender and Child
               Protection began holding sensitization meetings and trainings on the CPC structure
               with communities and local police in local communities. The Police Reform Working
               Group in Independent Medico Legal Unit (IMLU), a Kenyan NGO working to deepen people’s
               understanding of police reform, also conducts sensitization trainings on the CPC structure
               in some areas. One interviewee had conducted trainings on the NK structure in some
               areas in Nairobi. However, these efforts are small-scale, backed with few resources.
               Moreover, there is little or no monitoring or evaluation of the implementation of
               the two structures. In addition, local stakeholders and communities seemed to have
               had little influence in the development of the structures. As a result, many people
               see COP as a matter of top-down models imposed on them by a state apparatus they do
               not always trust. 
            </p>
            <p id="d1e389">
               <i>Nyumba Kumi came about two years ago. They created a new structure which was very
                  foreign to people. (…) It should be a community-driven initiative, owned by the communities.
                  It also needs to be based on the need of the community, on community demand</i> [<a href="#R54">54</a>]. 
            </p>
            <p id="d1e397">Lack of proper implementation, misunderstandings and confusion may lead to unfortunate
               practices and misuse of the COP models. In 2017, the NPS published the Community Policing
               Information Booklet, aimed at informing the public and police officers about the CPC
               structure and clearing up some of the misunderstandings as to the purpose and aim
               of COP. The booklet emphasizes that COP should not be identified with vigilantism,
               coercion or extortion, as a replacement for village elders, or as spy rings, a parallel
               security system, political forums, employment or other activities that contravene
               the law ([<a href="#R25">25</a>], pp.&nbsp;14–16)—all of these being problems that had arisen in several places.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e402">A common view in the areas visited for this study, in relation to the CPCs as well
               as NK, is that COP serves primarily as methods of surveillance and intelligence gathering
               for the state and the police. Many people consider those actively involved in the
               COP models to be police informants—a role with definite negative connotations in Kenya.
               A CBO representative put it this way: ‘When you are a Nyumba Kumi member you are a
               spy. They (the community) call it a spy for the government’. An NK member found that
               people in her community were sceptical of her participation in the cluster. ‘The community
               sees you as a snitch’ (…). People think you are a police informant’. A police officer
               further explained: ‘Here, being an informant is despised. (…) People working with
               the police are seen as un-socialized’. One NK member explained that if people see
               you reporting to the police, ‘it spoils the relationship between you and your community’.
               That COP initiatives are seen as systems for the state and the police to conduct surveillance
               is a clear indication of the widespread mistrust and gap between the state and the
               public. Many people have negative experiences from previous encounters with the state,
               with the police in particular. Here it is important to note that the end of the reporting
               line for NK is the President’s Office; in the NPS CPC structure, it is the Police
               IG. Indeed, in practice the two COP initiatives may serve as a means of gathering
               intelligence for the police and the state; moreover, the focus on communities and
               police identifying and solving problems together seems less emphasised during implementation.
               The NK trainer interviewed acknowledged that cluster members do not necessarily know
               if and what actions are taken after the meetings. ‘The problem with Nyumba Kumi is
               that you don’t know if something will be done with issues, whether there is a follow-up.
               The purpose is (only) to notify’. How the police understand, treat and use the information
               emerging from the COP forums is then of great importance for police-public trust.
               At the community level, many people are generally unwilling to provide information
               to the police, fearing that police officers may violate the principle of confidentiality.
               Several interviewees mentioned instances where police officers had leaked information;
               moreover, this issue was taken up by community members in almost all seven COP sensitization
               meetings observed in connection with this study. For example, in return for bribes,
               police officers have revealed the identity of individuals who reported cases, putting
               these persons at risk of retaliation and reprisals from the perpetrators or others
               with a stake in the case. One NK member said there had been incidents where: 
            </p>
            <p id="d1e404">
               <i>people who share information are at risk of being targeted. There is no confidentiality.
                  The people who make a complaint, for example regarding criminals, might end up having
                  descriptions of themselves given out and being targeted.</i> 
               
            </p>
            <p id="d1e409">A survey conducted in Nairobi and Kisumu counties by Transparency International Kenya
               in 2015–2016 found that nine out of ten respondents answered that they did not proactively
               share information with the police about an issue or a concern in their community ([<a href="#R52">52</a>], p.&nbsp;45). Group discussions conducted in the same study revealed that respondents
               were reluctant to share vital information with the police due to instances where information
               had been relayed back to the culprits, to the detriment of the informant [<a href="#R52">52</a>]. When individual police officers violate the principle of confidentiality, that
               naturally has an impact on police-public trust, in turn negatively affecting the implementation
               of COP efforts. Further, filing complaints against the police, or advocating for police
               accountability in COP forums, may prove equally risky. 
            </p>
            <p id="d1e417">
               <i>You are surrounded by people who can kill you the next minute. (…) You aren’t allowed
                  to say anything against the police. They are ‘little gods’. So that is not an area
                  where you can complain. If you do complain, they circulate your details, and things
                  get risky for you</i> [<a href="#R55">55</a>]. 
            </p>
            <p id="d1e426">Low confidentiality means a weak foundation for building partnerships. Due to negative
               views about individuals engaging in COP forums, local COP members risk accusations
               and retaliations from their own communities. Confidentiality breaches by police officers,
               as well civilian COP members, make the security situation even more difficult for
               COP members. An NK member explained that it is hard to recruit members to the clusters,
               because volunteers cannot be expected to put their lives at risk. At a sensitization
               meeting in one village, insecurity for COP members was identified as a main problem;
               and the CPC members themselves stressed the need for stronger security apparatus and
               measures around them. However, if the COP forums were less focused on intelligence
               gathering and providing information on specific criminal cases, and more steered towards
               collectively mapping and creating local solutions to overall insecurities in the communities,
               being part of a COP structure would not entail the same degree of risk.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e428">Another factor identified during the fieldwork was that civilians were misusing their
               COP membership to increase or maintain their own power. As mentioned, there were misunderstanding
               and confusion at the local level concerning structural and organizational aspects
               of the implementation of the two models. This created opportunities for misuse, not
               only for the police, but also for civilian members as well as community leaders. Nepotism
               and tribalism are common in many societal, economic and political processes in Kenya,
               and came into to play in the selection of COP forum members. According to NK policies,
               cluster members are to be democratically elected in biannual elections ([<a href="#R50">50</a>], pp.&nbsp;10–11). And the CPC guidelines specifically state that members are to represent
               different segments and groups in the community. However, in several case areas, the
               local COP members were appointed by the community chief, rather than the community
               electing their own representatives. A community member raised this issue in a sensitization
               meeting, saying that CPC members had been ‘selected through nepotism’. Several interviewees
               in another area claimed that the local chief had appointed the local NK members, all
               of whom were people in his inner circle. This supports the findings from a study in
               Nakuru, where more than half of the respondents answered that democracy in electing
               NK-initiative leaders was low or very low [<a href="#R53">53</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e436">Moreover, a former NK member interviewed for this study said that the chief used the
               NK structure to promote his own agenda: ‘issues get pressure whenever the chief is
               willing to give them pressure’. He described the NK meetings as merely playing to
               the gallery; further, that the chief would bribe members to report that the cluster
               was working well and that it had reduced the level of crime in that area.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e438">These are examples of how political or personal agendas overshadow the pillars of
               community partnerships and a collective approach to problem identification and solving.
               As many community members are in no position to hold local powerholders and leaders
               of COP forums accountable, and there are no proper oversight mechanisms for the two
               COP structures, local powerholders can appoint members, organize and run the COP forums
               according to their own personal agendas—which are not necessarily in the interest
               of the community as a whole. Another study of NK in Kayala, in Nairobi county, also
               showed that NK was seen as a way for village elders and leaders to promote their own
               interests rather than those of the community, and that the lack of effective accountability
               channels made it easier for people to take advantage of the system [<a href="#R54">54</a>]. In several areas, there were also reports of civilian CPC and NK members misusing
               the COP models to distort, harass and ‘police’—even to legitimize ‘arrests’—of other
               local residents. When this was mentioned in COP sensitization meetings observed in
               connection with this study, the trainer from the Directorate of Community Policing
               explained to the COP members and the police that only the police have the authority
               to make arrests, and discouraged civilian members from engaging in such practices,
               which could also entail considerable risks to personal security. In the early phases
               of CPC and NK implementation, civilian members were provided with COP identity cards
               for documentation. However, these were misused to legitimatize patrols, arrests and
               harassment of co-citizens, therefore such ID cards are no longer issued.

            <p id="d1e446">In addition to breaches of confidentiality, interviewees identified several other
               in-house problems that had a negative impact on police-public relations. Factors like
               working conditions, resources and training of Kenyan police officers hinder the implementation
               of the police reform and the two COP models. The public often evaluate the police
               forces in terms of their response time and effectiveness, and this influences both
               relations and trust ([<a href="#R33">33</a>], p.&nbsp;66). In Kenya, as elsewhere, it is hard for the police to meet all the expectations
               of the public. For instance, in one rural village, local police officers explained
               that they did not have a functional vehicle at their disposal. They were often dependent
               on the public to pay for their transport fares involved in conducting their work.
               In another village, the local police officers complained that they had to pay for
               transport out of their own pockets. Other police stations were unable to pay for fuel
               [<a href="#R52">52</a>]. In Kenya, many police stations, police posts and patrol bases lack the equipment
               and resources needed to be able to fulfil their duties properly.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e454">The working and living conditions of Kenyan police officers are generally harsh. Although
               the state provides housing, availability is a challenge. Often, several officers and
               their families must live together in cramped spaces in housing of low standard [<a href="#R52">52</a>]. Many police stations are poorly equipped and in bad shape. ICT usage is low; the
               station events log for registration of cases is a physical book, not yet a digitalized
               system. Effectiveness is also affected by the low density of police officers, who
               work long hours [<a href="#R52">52</a>]. Recent years have seen an upscaling in the recruitment of new police officers in
               Kenya in order to meet the UN police-civilian ratio of 1:450 [<a href="#R55">55</a>]; however, the actual number of officers working at local police stations varies
               from area to area. During one of the COP sensitization meetings, local police officers
               claimed that they were altogether only 26 police officers, from both Kenya Police
               Service and Administration Police Service, serving a population of 500 000. In 2012,
               the Usalama Reforms Forum published the report ‘Communities and their Police Stations’,
               which studied 21 police stations across Kenya. The report revealed large variation
               in standards in terms of facilities, equipment, organizational structure and staff
               among the police stations, police posts and patrol bases. It recommended that the
               government review all police stations, in order to determine whether they were fit
               for their purpose, and to ensure compliance with the minimum standards required to
               perform their core functions [<a href="#R56">56</a>].
               
            </p>
            <p id="d1e468">Lack of proper training of police officers is another issue. In 2014, basic police
               training in Kenya was cut from 15 to 9 months, and the concept of community policing
               has not been properly integrated into this training. A central element in mainstreaming
               police reforms involves reviewing and updating the police curriculum and training.
               An NGO representative spoke in favour of police training in ‘how to connect with communities
               and how to build trust with the communities’. Further, a police officer emphasised
               that the basic training curriculum is outdated: ‘The training is still based on the
               colonial model of training. The training was and still is to protect the ruling class’.
               Bringing the police training and curriculum in line with the police reform is an essential
               step towards ensuring a better understanding of what people-centred policing entails
               and how policies and models, including community policing, can be translated into
               everyday police practices and methods.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e470">However, the gap between what is taught at police colleges, on the one hand, and,
               on the other hand, existing police culture and practices on the ground may also prove
               a challenge. Longstanding internal ‘unofficial rules’ that police officers follow
               in the field is not necessarily in line with the police training. Training on good
               practices may have little effect in changing police behaviour unless followed up by
               the leadership in police districts, or if it conflicts with other incentives such
               as possibilities for promotions [<a href="#R57">57</a>]. Another issue is the gap between senior and junior officers. Some police officers
               interviewed explained that the younger officers often have a higher level of general
               education than their seniors, and with different views on policing methods. As police
               organizations are highly hierarchical and rank-based, it is difficult for junior and
               newly recruited personnel to bring forward new ideas, unless supported by their leaders.
               As two young police officers explained: 
            </p>
            <p id="d1e475">
               <i>We (junior officers) have a very different view. It was difficult for us to take education
                  on the side. Our senior leaders said either you work or you take your education—we
                  would have to choose. They don’t understand the benefits from it (education). I think
                  in 5 to 10 years, things will be different. The old generation is still there today,
                  we’ll have to wait until they are gone.</i> 
               
            </p>
            <p id="d1e480">However, the junior-senior gap may take other forms as well. In a sensitization meeting
               in one village, a community representative spoke of how junior police officers exhibited
               violent behaviour towards community members. He suggested that junior officers should
               patrol along with senior officers who are more experienced in relating to and communicating
               with the community, to learn from them.

            <div class="section"><a id="s4.1">
                  <!-- named anchor --></a><h3 class="section-title">4.1.- Closeness versus Distance—a Balancing Act</h3>
               <p id="d1e485">The two COP models are, at least on paper, aimed at bringing the police and the public
                  closer together. Achieving the right degree of closeness versus distance to the population
                  is a balancing act: ‘There are endless stories about the tension between this need
                  for a close relationships to the societal space which is the object of policing- and
                  the need for distance that shall ensure ‘discipline’, the ultimate orientation of
                  police work towards the supposed ends of the state’ ([<a href="#R1">1</a>], p.&nbsp;23). During the colonial period in Kenya, the British recruited to the police
                  forces individuals from communities seen as less hostile towards the regime; this
                  recruitment was highly ethnicized [<a href="#R4">4</a>]. Moreover, ’(…) police officers were not allowed to serve in their home areas. This
                  only served to cement the view of many people that the police was an alien unit’ ([<a href="#R4">4</a>], p.&nbsp;591). There are still traces of this system in the Kenyan police today. Police
                  officers are deployed on a rotation system, preferably changing duty station every
                  five years—one reason being to prevent them from becoming too embedded in local communities.
                  The rotation system can be seen as a way of trying to ensure impartiality and neutrality
                  among deployed police officers. However, tribalism is a central element in the social
                  and political construction of Kenyan communities, and tribe and politics are closely
                  interconnected. In the rural villages visited in Kisumu and Siaya counties, most police
                  officers did not belong to the same tribe as the majority of the local population.
                  In such cases, tribalism and political tensions between tribes can fuel community
                  reluctance to trust the police and cooperate with them. In that sense, the police
                  rotation deployment system may stand in the way of COP initiatives encouraging partnerships
                  and collaboration. The rotation system also represents an opportunity for political
                  leaders to govern and control areas of opposing tribes, political parties, views and
                  alliances, and to steer elections [<a href="#R58">58</a>]. In addition, all police officers are not necessarily interested in getting to know
                  a new area where they are only to spend a few years. A senior police officer in one
                  rural village also pointed out that it takes time to get to understand a new local
                  context.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e499">Lastly, low police salaries impede the building of police-public trust. In fact, the
                  Ransley Report recommended higher salaries and a greater police management focus on
                  salaries [<a href="#R37">37</a>]. Many police officers must depend on bribes to provide for their families and make
                  ends meet. Low payment increases police vulnerability to corruption and makes officers
                  susceptible to manipulations by more powerful segments of the society. One police
                  interviewee conducting trainings on COP found it difficult to encourage police officers
                  to engage with local communities: 
               </p>
               <p id="d1e504">
                  <i>A challenge is that the police don’t want to connect with the communities, because
                     then it is harder to get bribes. It is harder to ask for money, bribes and harass
                     someone you know and have a relationship with.</i> 
                  
               </p>
               <p id="d1e509">Hence, local police officers see models aimed at building stronger police-public relationships
                  as economically counter-productive. Mark Leting touches on this aspect in his study
                  of the NK in Kenya: 
               </p>
               <p id="d1e511">
                  <i>Police who are poorly paid and have low morale as a result of serious management problems
                     and corruption are not likely to be motivated to cooperate with the community and
                     there may be a general lack of respect for community policing strategy</i> ([<a href="#R59">59</a>], p.&nbsp;32) 
               </p>
               <p id="d1e519">Malpractice in the police in Kenya, such as corruption, lack of accountability, poor
                  leadership and use of violent and undemocratic methods, collectively constitutes an
                  institutional problem. Deniz Kocak argues that basic bureaucratic police professionalism
                  and capacities are necessary conditions to establish community policing ([<a href="#R60">60</a>], p.&nbsp;2). Maurice Punch applies the metaphors of ‘rotten apples’, ‘rotten barrels’
                  and ‘rotten orchards’ to police institutions [<a href="#R61">61</a>], nothing that the police themselves often employ the ‘rotten apple’ metaphor for
                  a ‘deviant cop who slips into bad ways and contaminates the other essentially good
                  officers—which is an individualistic, human failure model of deviance’ ([<a href="#R61">61</a>], p.&nbsp;173). In a ‘rotten barrel’, the deviance spreads to a certain unit or segment
                  of the police. A solution to rotten apples and barrels is to remove and replace them.
                  With ‘rotten orchards’, however, malpractice has become systemic, perhaps even encouraged
                  or protected by certain elements in the system: ‘at certain times and in certain contexts,
                  police deviance becomes virtually institutionalized, is affected by and affects other
                  parts of the criminal justice system, may be related to wider influences in the broader
                  enviroment and leads to what I call “system failure”’ ([<a href="#R61">61</a>], p.&nbsp;172). Plagued by endemic corruption, structural and management challenges, the
                  police institution in Kenya may be characterized as such a ‘system failure’. That
                  does not mean that all police officers are ‘bad’—on the contrary, some civilian interviewees
                  said that they do trust and cooperate with certain local police officers. The challenge
                  can rather be seen as the system which facilitates, encourages, protects and rewards
                  certain deviant behaviours and practices.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e533">This problem concerns not only the police, but the justice system as a whole. Several
                  interviewees, both civilian and police, emphasized that the justice and court system
                  is seen as weak and corrupt. In turn, low confidence in the justice system and rule
                  of law contributes to reluctance to report cases to the police or share information
                  with them in the first place. As a result, the police have a hard time performing
                  their duties, for example getting witnesses to testify in court. One CBO representative
                  explained that sometimes local police officers even deem the justice system so corrupt
                  and insufficient that they decide to take justice into their own hands. Punch argues
                  that to be able to explain how system failures occur and are maintained, a range of
                  mechanisms within the organization as well as its wider environment must be taken
                  into account. 
               </p>
               <p id="d1e535">
                  <i>In an organization designed to uphold the law, the law can be broken because control,
                     supervision, checks and balances, monitoring, audits and leadership may all fail to
                     function adequately while cultural and institutional pressures promote and support
                     deviance (…). This requires our explanations to be posited on an analysis that ties
                     individual and group behavior to complex, causal strands of formal and informal mechanisms
                     of social interaction within the organization and with the external environment</i> ([<a href="#R61">61</a>], p.&nbsp;174). 
               </p>
               <p id="d1e543">As noted, the challenges of implementing COP are closely connected to the wider socio-economic
                  and political context. For instance, that civilians as well as police officers may
                  use the COP models for their own or tribal gain, and that political tensions stand
                  in the way. Tribalism, nepotism and corruption are not specific to COP initiatives,
                  but embedded in the overall social, political, economic structures at the local and
                  national levels. The police represent only one piece in a larger political game for
                  power and resources, so police reform or community policing models alone cannot to
                  be expected to challenge or change such dynamics and systems. Reform must be a part
                  of a larger state building process involving wider public and political reforms and
                  developments.

               <!-- named anchor --></a><h2 class="main-title">5.- Whose Police?</h2>
            <p id="d1e548">Finally, perhaps the most significant challenge to proper implementation of the two
               COP models, concerns the mandate of the police in Kenya and the role they are set
               to fulfil in society. The main police ‘clientele’ steers how policing is carried out.
               As Jackson and colleagues emphasize, the degree of trust in the police hinges not
               only on the effectiveness and competence of the police, but also involves aspects
               such as police commitment, the extent of which the police care about the people they
               serve, and their capacity to understand the needs of the community and are willing
               to address these needs ([<a href="#R33">33</a>], p.&nbsp;66). Research on procedural justice shows that how citizens assess the fairness
               of the police and justice system is highly dependent on how the police interact with
               the population and how police officers execute their power [<a href="#R62">62</a>]. In turn, the way police officers behave and view the public can be understood in
               light of two different ‘police paradigms’ of the function and role of the police,
               especially to whom the police are held accountable [<a href="#R63">63</a>]. On the one hand, the main mandate of the police may be to protect the state: as
               a result, members of the public are often excluded from partnerships [<a href="#R63">63</a>]. This may also be an ideological cover for more repressive functions of social control
               [<a href="#R64">64</a>]. In the second paradigm, the main task of the police is defined as being to protect
               and serve the public ([<a href="#R63">63</a>], pp.&nbsp;78–79). In practice, there is not necessarily a strict division between the
               two paradigms ([<a href="#R63">63</a>], p.&nbsp;79) and police systems encompass both functions to varying degrees [<a href="#R2">2</a>, <a href="#R65">65</a>]. This difference between the two functions is reflected in how policing is carried
               out ([<a href="#R63">63</a>], p.&nbsp;79). To return to the case of Kenya, one police officer interviewed said that
               some of his police colleagues ‘have a superiority complex. They do not engage or mingle
               with civilians. The communities feel they are looked down upon.’ One reason for this
               behaviour, he argued, was the focus on ‘tackling the enemy’ which is taught during
               police training. Some community members interviewed for this study confirmed this
               view: they feel that the police regard them as enemies and treat them as such. Such
               police behaviours and the role the police are trained to perform indicate a heavy
               state-protection mandate, with less emphasis on providing a service to the public.
               Grasping the role and function of the police today also requires understanding the
               social and political responsibilities of the police in their various historical manifestations
               ([<a href="#R63">63</a>], p.&nbsp;78). As noted, the police institution in Kenya has its origins in the colonial
               period, where the police were to protect the powerholders from rebellion against the
               regime. The current police reform, endorsing a people-centred police, represent a
               push for a paradigm shift from this traditional system. Such transitions require political
               will.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e584">Alice Hills argues that the police in many African countries are in fact accountable
               solely to their presidents ([<a href="#R66">66</a>], p.&nbsp;403); further, that police commissioners in these countries are the president’s
               point of access to the police institution ([<a href="#R66">66</a>], p.&nbsp;407). Citing examples from several presidents in Africa, including Kenya’s former
               President Kibaki, she hold that presidents do not want a police answerable to parliamentary
               committees or judicial enquiries: they ‘value the police as a tool for enforcing political
               decisions, maintaining order, regulating activities and regime representation’ ([<a href="#R66">66</a>], p.&nbsp;407). In such contexts, Hills argues, security sector reform is unrealistic,
               as state leaders have little to gain from democratizing the police: on the contrary,
               that would reduce their personal power ([<a href="#R66">66</a>], p.&nbsp;406). Hence, proper implementation of police reforms and changes in police practices
               relies on whether the president or other powerholders can benefit from it or not.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e598">The stated intention behind the Kenyan police reform and the two COP models—to transform
               the police institution into a people-centred police with greater public accountability—may
               not serve the interests of the president, or other powerholders. On the other hand,
               closer police-public coordination for gathering information may yield valuable intelligence
               that can protect the regime. This is in line with what many interviewees for this
               study have said: that COP is just another platform for powerholders to collect intelligence
               and conduct surveillance of the population, in order to maintain or increase their
               power. For many Kenyans, the main pillars of the NPS COP—problem-solving, partnership
               and police transformation—are simply words on paper. As long as the main function
               of the police is to protect the regime from its own citizenry, political and economic
               interests will continue to steer the police reform and the two COP models. As Tyler
               has put it, ‘Consequently, legitimacy is the most promising framework for discussing
               changing the goals of policing and moving from a police force model to a police service
               model’ ([<a href="#R67">67</a>], p.&nbsp;29). As long as tribal politics (including the president’s personal power) and
               the police are two sides of the same coin, transforming the Kenyan police into a legitimate,
               democratic and people-centred police service seems unlikely. As Kocak points out,
               policing cannot be separated from its political context, and in order to promote and
               establish a community-oriented approach to policing that is in line with good governance,
               a transformative context of democratization is necessary ([<a href="#R60">60</a>], p.&nbsp;35). He adds that the necessary conditions for establishing community policing
               are ‘a police organization with, at least, basic professional bureaucratic capacities,
               a genuine commitment and political will on behalf of local authorities to promote
               and push for its implementation, and a concept or approach to community policing that
               actually matters to the respective local context and its realities’ ([<a href="#R60">60</a>], p.&nbsp;35). These conditions are not yet in place in Kenya.

            <p id="d1e612">On paper, the police reform underway in Kenya represents a paradigm shift towards
               a people-centred police. Enhancing police-public relations and trust are at the core
               of the reform. Two community policing (COP) models, the National Police Service’s
               <i>Community Policing Structure and the President’s Office’ Nyumba Kumi</i> (NK) model, have been developed in order to bridge the gap between the police and
               local communities. The NK model involves anchoring community policing at the household
               level in clusters, in order to improve relations and communications among community
               members themselves as well as with the police. The NPS model is structured through
               Community Policing Committees (CPC), consisting of members representing different
               segments of the community and local police. In their meetings, CPC members are, collectively,
               to identify and solve problems at the community level, and coordinate activities,
               programmes and trainings to promote security.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e617">In practice, however, proper implementation of NK and the CPCs has proven difficult.
               Observations and interviews in local communities in urban and rural parts in Western,
               Mid- and Eastern Kenya between 2016 and 2018, with community organizations, community
               representatives and police officers, show considerable scepticism towards the two
               COP models. This article has identified and analysed some main reasons why so many
               people are reluctant to engage in COP, in order to explain the failure of the two
               COP initiatives to improve police-public trust and cooperation.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e619">Firstly, in the communities visited, the two initiatives had not been properly anchored
               at the local level among community members, their leaders and the police. As a result,
               confusion and misunderstandings arose, as to the set-up, goal and purpose of the two
               COP structures. Moreover, local communities saw the models as top-down approaches
               imposed on them from above—not as initiatives driven and organized by the communities
               themselves, which would have given the communities greater agency and ownership in
               the processes. As a result of uncertainties regarding the policies and guidelines
               for implementation, as well as the lack of oversight and accountability mechanism,
               civilians and police COP members have in some cases misused the two structures for
               personal gain and/or to accumulate and secure power.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e621">Secondly, police-public trust and implementation of the COP models have been impeded
               by in-house problems within the police system, such as lack of human and economic
               resources, poor working conditions, training, management and leadership at various
               levels in the police. Moreover, the police reform, including people-centred policing
               and COP policies, has not been translated into everyday police practices on the ground
               nor properly integrated into the police training and curriculum.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e623">That is connected to the third point: the role and function of the police, and the
               question of who the police are to serve. Ever since Kenya’s colonial period, the mandate
               of the police has predominantly been to serve and protect the powerholders. Also today,
               politics and the police are two sides of the same coin; the president and other political
               figures have great personal power, also over the police. Powerholders have little
               to gain if the police forces are transformed into a truly people-centred, democratic
               and accountable system. In fact, the two COP models represent a way for powerholders
               to monitor and maintain surveillance of local communities as a strategy for securing
               the regime and their own personal power.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e625">Interviewees reiterated the common perception in the areas visited: COP merely represents
               a method for the state to ‘spy’ on its population. Without political will and power
               to ensure proper implementation, the policies will remain merely words on paper. Moreover,
               societal dynamics such as tribalism, nepotism and corruption lie at the root of many
               political, economic and social processes in Kenya, influencing rule of law and the
               justice system as a whole. Police reform and community policing models alone can hardly
               be expected to challenge this. What is needed is a wider state-building process with
               deep-going public and political reforms, developments and democratization. As of now,
               the basic conditions for implementation of the two COP models for the benefit of the
               general population in Kenya are simply not there. People-centric policing and greater
               police-public trust remain a long-term vision rather than a realistic goal for the
               coming years. For the police in Kenya to become the ‘people’s police’, the road is
               indeed long and bumpy, with many hazards and detours ahead.
