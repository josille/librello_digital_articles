                                 The aim of the strategy is to provide a framework for the operationalisation of COP
                                 in the country. COP in Uganda is viewed both as a philosophy and an organisational
                                 strategy aiming at promoting new partnerships between the police and the community.
                                 This research examines how the UPF applies the COP strategy in Gulu Uganda to create
                                 new partnerships between the police and the community as part of the preparation for
                                 transforming Gulu into a city in Uganda. Anchored in qualitative research conducted
                                 in 2018–2019 in Gulu municipality, we examined COP in theory and practice. We fleshed
                                 out the different COP interventions installed by the police, observed how these applications
                                 of COP are perceived by the community and local leadership, and evaluated the extent
                                 to which these applications and perceptions contribute to creating new partnerships
                                 between the police and the public, as well as how these constitute an operationalisation
                                 of the UPF strategy for COP. There are several interventions labelled as COP in Gulu,
                                 including joint patrols, Mayumba Kumi, sensitisation activities, and partnerships
                                 with NGOs. Most of these applications are ‘old wine in new bottles’ and do not qualify
                                 as attempts to create new partnerships between the police and the public. In linkage
                                 to the mode of governance exercised by the Government of Uganda, the data collected
                                 indicates that the public at large still views the police as a corrupt, unpredictable,
                                 and a violent force that serves the interests of elites rather than a public service.
                                 As long as the police is viewed in such a way, it is difficult to create meaningful
                                 partnerships between the police and the public, and subsequently it becomes difficult
                                 to successfully apply the UPF COP strategy.</span></div>

                              <p id="d1e73">In January 2017 the Ugandan Police Force (UPF) issued a new Strategy for Community
                                 Policing [<a href="#R1">1</a>]. The concept of Community Policing (COP) was formally recognised by the UPF in 1989,
                                 shortly after the Museveni’s National Resistance Movement (NRM) assumed power in 1986,
                                 and in 1993 COP was formally introduced as a national program in Uganda ([<a href="#R1">1</a>], p.&nbsp;2). Since then COP has been partially implemented in selective locations in
                                 Uganda [<a href="#R2">2</a>, <a href="#R3">3</a>]. The new Strategy for Community Policing issued in 2017 is a comprehensive attempt
                                 to move the UPF towards embracing both the philosophy and practice of COP in the entire
                                 country ([<a href="#R1">1</a>], p.&nbsp;6).
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e90">The UPF defines COP based on Trojanowicz and Bucqueroux ([<a href="#R4">4</a>], p.&nbsp;2) as: <i>…a philosophy and an organisational strategy that promotes a new partnership between
                                    the people and their police. It is premised on the principle that both the police
                                    and the community work together to identify, prioritise and solve contemporary problems
                                    such as crime, drugs, fear of crime, social disorder and overall neighbourhood decay,
                                    with the goal of improving the overall quality of life ([<a href="#R1">1</a>], p.&nbsp;3).</i>

                              <p id="d1e101">The strategy document is based on the assertion that weak state institutions in transitional
                                 democracies in Africa lead to enhanced and organised criminal activities that challenge
                                 the capacity of the police to address issues without engaging and partnering with
                                 local communities ([<a href="#R1">1</a>], p.&nbsp;3). COP is thus flagged as the most prominent approach to work with communities
                                 to partner with- and assist -the police in addressing the root causes of crime and
                                 insecurity.

                                 As the UPF strategy document suggests, policing is viewed as a practice undertaken
                                 by the state through the UPF, and COP is flagged as a police initiative that aims
                                 at incorporating the active involvement of citizens in policing efforts ([<a href="#R1">1</a>], pp.&nbsp;4-5). This paper is based on research conducted in Uganda between 2018-2019
                                 aiming at examining how the UPF is operationalising the 2017 Strategy for Community
                                 Policing. The objective of this paper is to outline the application of COP in Gulu
                                 municipality in Uganda, focusing on success and challenges as highlighted both by
                                 the police and various communities. As such, this research is primarily focused on
                                 how the UPF as a state actor attempts to improve the provision of security, safety,
                                 and maintenance of order through the application of the COP strategy in Gulu.

                                 The area represents a post-war context as it emerged from the civil war between the
                                 Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) and the Ugandan People Defence Force (UPDF) between 1986-2006.
                                 As such it is a location where the relationships between the Ugandan state institutions
                                 and the Acholi people inhabiting the district are characterised by mistrust. As part
                                 of the post-conflict reconstruction efforts, the Government of Uganda (GoU) selected
                                 Gulu municipality as one of the potential candidates to receive a city status, eventually
                                 granted in June 2020, shortly after this research was completed. This research was
                                 conducted as the GoU and Gulu municipality were preparing the physical and institutional
                                 infrastructure for the transition of Gulu into a city. As such, this research examined
                                 the extent of the efforts by the UPF and the community in Gulu to apply the strategy
                                 for COP in relation to the context described above.

                              <p id="d1e131">This article is structured as follows: we begin by situating this study in the broader
                                 literature on policing and COP in Africa and the subsequent discussions on security
                                 provision in Uganda. We then move to the context, beginning with a presentation of
                                 a brief historical background of policing in Uganda to highlight the country’s path
                                 towards COP as a national strategy. We follow by turning the discussion towards the
                                 application of the Uganda National Strategy for Community Policing in Gulu, starting
                                 with a presentation of the architecture and structure of this research, followed by
                                 a brief background highlighting the conflict/post-conflict context in Gulu, and the
                                 contemporary roots of crime and insecurity as viewed by the police and the community
                                 in the district. We then turn to the presentation and analysis of the empirical data
                                 collected for the purpose of this research, examining the content in relation to the
                                 aims of the UPF model for the operationalisation of community policing as highlighted
                                 above. And lastly, we finalise this paper with concluding remarks.

                              <p id="d1e136">In recent years, COP has been flagged as a central model for police transformation,
                                 especially in ‘developing’ countries [<a href="#R5">5</a>]. In Uganda, the new UPF Strategy for Community Policing underlines COP as a transformational
                                 approach aiming at remodelling the state policing style from an ‘authoritarian top-down
                                 approach to a consensual community policing approach’ ([<a href="#R1">1</a>], p.&nbsp;1). In several Western societies where the concept of COP has been conceived
                                 and operationalised, the history of formal state policing suggests a slow transformation
                                 of policing styles from a monopolised state approach, through empowering the police
                                 as a professional self-governing institution, towards community-oriented problem-solving
                                 policing [<a href="#R5">5</a>, <a href="#R6">6</a>], leading to various examples of success and failure.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e150">As the literature on policing indicates, COP was propagated and exported from Western
                                 countries mainly through aid mechanisms, and particularly to countries in post-conflict
                                 contexts [<a href="#R5">5</a>, <a href="#R7">7</a>]. In Africa, donors support and promote COP with the aim of improving security, rebuilding
                                 trust between the state institutions and the public, improving human rights, reducing
                                 criminal activity, and eliminating police abuse of their powers [<a href="#R8">8</a>, <a href="#R9">9</a>, <a href="#R10">10</a>, <a href="#R11">11</a>]. Studies of COP adoption and application in African contexts have consistently shown
                                 that the concept does not yield the intended results [<a href="#R5">5</a>, <a href="#R7">7</a>, <a href="#R8">8</a>, <a href="#R9">9</a>, <a href="#R10">10</a>, <a href="#R11">11</a>, <a href="#R12">12</a>, <a href="#R13">13</a>, <a href="#R14">14</a>, <a href="#R15">15</a>]. Several scholars have linked the relative lack of success of COP applications in
                                 many African states to historical, conceptual, institutional, political, structural,
                                 economic, cultural, and implementation challenges [<a href="#R5">5</a>, <a href="#R7">7</a>, <a href="#R9">9</a>, <a href="#R16">16</a>, <a href="#R17">17</a>, <a href="#R18">18</a>, <a href="#R19">19</a>, <a href="#R20">20</a>, <a href="#R21">21</a>]. In recent years, several studies on human and state security have attempted to
                                 nuance the complex and fluid reality of security provision, highlighting the existence
                                 of multiple security providers consisting of formal/informal and state/non-state policing
                                 mechanisms across various contexts [<a href="#R22">22</a>, <a href="#R23">23</a>, <a href="#R24">24</a>, <a href="#R25">25</a>, <a href="#R26">26</a>, <a href="#R27">27</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e250">Within a reality of multiple security providers, policing in Africa (and elsewhere)
                                 is better understood as a ‘set of practices that can be exercised, and governed, by
                                 various state, private and communal actors’ ([<a href="#R27">27</a>], p.&nbsp;2). Formal state policing is thus enacted as a part of complex assemblages [<a href="#R28">28</a>, <a href="#R29">29</a>] where different actors and entities operate in overlapping spaces [<a href="#R22">22</a>, <a href="#R24">24</a>, <a href="#R25">25</a>, <a href="#R27">27</a>, <a href="#R30">30</a>, <a href="#R31">31</a>]. As such, attempts to operationalise COP by the state are constituted alongside
                                 various other security providers that deliver a variety of policing and security related
                                 services. These entities claim various degrees of legitimacy based on various available
                                 repertoires ([<a href="#R22">22</a>, <a href="#R23">23</a>, <a href="#R30">30</a>] [<a href="#R32">32</a>], pp.&nbsp;693-694), leading to a reality of hybrid security structures ([<a href="#R24">24</a>], p.&nbsp;8). As indicated by Albrecht and Kyed ([<a href="#R27">27</a>], p.&nbsp;5) ‘state police and civilian policing groups draw on each other, and mix a
                                 variety of practices, to enact order’. These relationships often emerge in opposition
                                 and competition to one another, but also in cooperation and to bridge gaps (see examples
                                 in [<a href="#R22">22</a>, <a href="#R24">24</a>, <a href="#R26">26</a>, <a href="#R27">27</a>, <a href="#R30">30</a>, <a href="#R33">33</a>, <a href="#R34">34</a>]). Many significant challenges interact with effective and efficient state policing
                                 around the world. In Africa, scholars have highlighted multiple limitations of state
                                 policing, including the roles and policies of authoritarian regimes, the use of policing
                                 to advance the interests of elites, subdue opposition and extinguish dissidence, police
                                 corruption, violence and impunity, police complicity with criminals, abuse of human
                                 rights, and lack of resources dedicated to state policing to name a few [<a href="#R5">5</a>, <a href="#R8">8</a>, <a href="#R11">11</a>, <a href="#R15">15</a>, <a href="#R18">18</a>, <a href="#R26">26</a>, <a href="#R27">27</a>, <a href="#R30">30</a>, <a href="#R35">35</a>, <a href="#R36">36</a>, <a href="#R37">37</a>, <a href="#R38">38</a>] . These limitations have been met with various attempts to improve security provision
                                 instigated by civil society, communities, groups, individuals and the state at different
                                 times and contexts, including vigilantism, informal policing, popular justice at different
                                 societal and organisational levels, private security, gated communities, and a plethora
                                 of security and security related services provided by local, national, and international
                                 organisations [<a href="#R5">5</a>, <a href="#R8">8</a>, <a href="#R11">11</a>, <a href="#R15">15</a>, <a href="#R18">18</a>, <a href="#R26">26</a>, <a href="#R27">27</a>, <a href="#R30">30</a>, <a href="#R34">34</a>, <a href="#R35">35</a>, <a href="#R36">36</a>, <a href="#R37">37</a>, <a href="#R38">38</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e400">While many non-state security providers do emerge to fill gaps where the state is
                                 weak, not present, or chooses to disregard insecurity, the state also establishes,
                                 sponsors, and/or co-opts alternative security providers at different times and for
                                 different reasons [<a href="#R39">39</a>, <a href="#R40">40</a>]. Baker ([<a href="#R30">30</a>], p.&nbsp;23) notes that unlike many other contexts in Africa, in Museveni’s Uganda there
                                 was never a ‘law enforcement vacuum’ that could be filled by non-state policing agencies.
                                 Even though ‘fragmented and overlapping patterns of policing’ exist in Uganda, the
                                 state maintains degrees of influence and control over alternative security provision,
                                 from the village level and upwards [<a href="#R30">30</a>]. There is also evidence that the state in Uganda makes conscious decisions about
                                 intervening or allowing illegal attempts to provide security such as mob justice and
                                 vigilante actions taken by citizens or local political leadership to address criminality
                                 [<a href="#R30">30</a>, <a href="#R34">34</a>, <a href="#R41">41</a>, <a href="#R42">42</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e427">Some authors note that the Ugandan state maintains control over various forms of alternative
                                 security provision and acts ambiguously towards those, sometimes supporting them,
                                 at other times penalising them as it serves state interests or objectives [<a href="#R30">30</a>, <a href="#R34">34</a>]. Such strategies allow the state to exercise various forms of security governance
                                 and control over people directly and/or by proxy [<a href="#R11">11</a>, <a href="#R34">34</a>, <a href="#R43">43</a>, <a href="#R44">44</a>, <a href="#R45">45</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e451">Tapscott ([<a href="#R34">34</a>], p.&nbsp;265) suggests that the GoU in general, and in Gulu in particular, uses a mode
                                 of governance she dubs as institutionalized arbitrariness. Through this term, Tapscott
                                 describes how the state employs a strategy of ambiguity and unpredictability in the
                                 security sector ‘to prevent citizens from organizing independently from the state’.
                                 This mode of governance, as Tapscott [<a href="#R34">34</a>] illustrates, is particularly effective in Gulu where most of the adult population
                                 have had first-hand experience with unpredictable violent measures exercised both
                                 by the LRA and by the state. By way of institutionalized arbitrariness, the state
                                 maintains both direct and decentralised control, balancing between priorities and
                                 resources, allowing actors to exercise various forms of security provision approved
                                 by the state, while interfering harshly and violently when the state has vested or
                                 political interests to do so. Consequently, the state is produced in the citizen’s
                                 imagination as hegemonic ([<a href="#R24">24</a>], p.&nbsp;268). This mode of governance also resonates with Baker ([<a href="#R30">30</a>], p.&nbsp;30) observations regarding state policing in Uganda, highlighting that Museveni’s
                                 regime has always ‘sought security partners who will work within the law and under
                                 its supervision’. Baker emphasises that security provision in Uganda, state/non-state,
                                 formal/informal, is almost always under the ‘state influence and approval’, if not
                                 initiated by the state ([<a href="#R30">30</a>], p.&nbsp;37). Keeping security actors under constant supervision allows state-controlled
                                 organisations such as the police to pull-back or intervene at will, leaving both alternative
                                 security providers and ordinary people under constant uncertainty concerning how,
                                 according to which rules, in which way, and to what extent the official state may
                                 intercede ([<a href="#R34">34</a>], p.&nbsp;282). In such a way the state produces the image of a strong, centralised, and
                                 if necessary, violent sovereign in the mind of the population, without the need to
                                 always invest the resources for daily security provision ([<a href="#R34">34</a>], p.&nbsp;282).

                              <p id="d1e475">With this background in mind, this article focuses on COP as a formal policing initiative
                                 by the state. Considering the institutionalised forms of governance described above
                                 through which the state in Uganda projects power, we observe how COP is operationalised
                                 in Gulu under the main objective of the 2017 Strategy for Community Policing.

                              <p id="d1e480">Like in many former British colonies, the history of policing in Uganda begins with
                                 the introduction of institutions designed to safeguard the interests of the colonial
                                 power [<a href="#R46">46</a>, <a href="#R47">47</a>, <a href="#R48">48</a>, <a href="#R49">49</a>].

                              <p id="d1e494">Uganda became a British protectorate in 1894, and shortly after, the Uganda Armed
                                 Constabulary was introduced (1899) as a paramilitary force tasked to forcibly supress
                                 conflicts between local tribes for the purpose of securing colonial interests ([<a href="#R50">50</a>], p.&nbsp;96). When the affairs of the Ugandan protectorate were transferred from the
                                 foreign office to the colonial office, the post of Inspector General of the Uganda
                                 Protectorate Police was established. Headed by a British officer and led by European
                                 inspectors, the force went through a re-organisation process aimed at professionalising

                              <p id="d1e502">While the colonial police continued to focus mainly on a variety of tasks that secured
                                 the interests of the colonial society and economy, the gradual transition towards
                                 the system of indirect rule during 1920s–1930s, transferred a variety of powers to
                                 traditional rulers in the various kingdoms in the country, including establishing
                                 local police forces to maintain law and order ([<a href="#R1">1</a>], p.&nbsp;1). This allowed the colonial police to transform into a more professional law
                                 enforcement organisation and the introduction of new policing methods such as fingerprinting
                                 and forensics ([<a href="#R1">1</a>], p.&nbsp;1). Nevertheless, the police continued to serve as a tool of power on behalf
                                 of the colonial government and not as a service to the public at large. As the colonial
                                 powers began to experience enhanced pushback against colonial rule during the 1940s
                                 and onwards, the colonial police in Uganda had to increasingly deal with rebellions,
                                 strike suppression, tax evasion, riots, and general agitation of the public against
                                 colonial occupation [<a href="#R1">1</a>, <a href="#R49">49</a>].

                              <p id="d1e516">In 1962 when Uganda gained independence, the first Ugandan Inspector General of Police
                                 (IGP) was appointed. The newly formed state was established upon the bureaucratic
                                 and administrative foundations inherited from the colonial regime. The initial Ugandan
                                 constitution from 1962 recognised the special status granted to traditional rulers
                                 under the system of indirect rule in the kingdoms of Buganda, Bunyoro, Toro and Ankole.
                                 By extension, these kingdoms maintained the local police forces established during
                                 the colonial period, though these were technically accountable to the IGP ([<a href="#R50">50</a>], p.&nbsp;98). When President Milton Obote abolished the special status granted to local
                                 rulers in 1967, the local police forces merged into the Uganda Police Force ([<a href="#R50">50</a>], p.&nbsp;98), and the UPF was increasingly used by the government to subdue political
                                 dissidence. In parallel some police powers were transferred to newly formed organisations
                                 such as the General Service Department (GSD) established to identify political disloyalty
                                 and dissidence against President Obote [<a href="#R50">50</a>, <a href="#R51">51</a>]. The trend of relegating police powers and using the police alongside newly established
                                 agencies to brutally subdue political dissidence and disloyalty continued during the
                                 Amin regime [<a href="#R52">52</a>]. During his rule, policing in Uganda became synonymous with government oppression,
                                 and the various ‘policing’ agencies used by Amin, namely the Military Police, the
                                 Public Safety Unit and the State Research Bureau were viewed as brutal death squads
                                 under the direct control of the President ([<a href="#R50">50</a>], p.&nbsp;99).

                              <p id="d1e537">Following the Amin regime in the early 1980s and until Yoweri Museveni assumed power
                                 in 1986, the country went through a period of political turmoil. Following Amin, the
                                 institutions of the state were largely dysfunctional, corrupt, and exercised their
                                 authority with power and violence. An attempt to reform the police occurred in the
                                 early 1980s through recruitment and training of educated police officers as part of
                                 the conditionalities attached to the structural adjustment program of the International
                                 Monetary Fund [<a href="#R51">51</a>]. During Milton Obote’s second regime, and before Yoweri Museveni assumed power,
                                 an internal security agency dubbed the National Security Agency (NASA) was established
                                 and given criminal investigation powers. Similarly to other such agencies established
                                 previously in Uganda, the role of the NASA was to locate and subdue political dissidence.
                                 NASA agents circumvented the police and prison system ([<a href="#R50">50</a>], p.&nbsp;99) and its agents conducted themselves above the law, arresting and torturing
                                 people suspected of disloyalty and conspiracy against Obote [<a href="#R52">52</a>]. When he finally assumed power in 1986, Museveni began to reform government institutions
                                 to weed-out Obote loyalists. He then launched a plan to increase the size of the police
                                 to 30000, and upgrade training and equipment ([<a href="#R50">50</a>], p.&nbsp;100). In parallel, Museveni created a local government structure known today
                                 as the Local Councils, ranging from the village level, through the parish, sub-county,
                                 county, and district (LC1 to LC5 respectively). The local councils were invested with
                                 law-and-order responsibilities which included patrols and arrests of petty criminals
                                 on the community level, and as such provided important support to the UPF and other
                                 policing structures.

                              <p id="d1e551">Since 1986 Uganda has been politically stable under the rule of Yoweri Museveni [<a href="#R53">53</a>]. Between 1986 and 1989 the police force was re-built and restructured ([<a href="#R30">30</a>], p.&nbsp;27). In December 1989 the President announced that the Police is ready to assume
                                 responsibility for law and order in the country, except in some districts, especially
                                 in Northern Uganda where the civil war between the government and the LRA was ongoing
                                 ([<a href="#R50">50</a>], p.&nbsp;100). It is since 1989 that the police under Museveni began to shift, at least
                                 in rhetoric, towards public service, and the concept of community policing was introduced
                                 for the first time ([<a href="#R3">3</a>], p.&nbsp;642).

                                    <p id="d1e568">The rationale for COP in Uganda stems from the brief historical overview outlined
                                       above. The UPF stresses that the history of policing in Uganda before 1989 has created
                                       a hierarchical top-down oppressive force, used by the government to control society
                                       ([<a href="#R1">1</a>], p.&nbsp;1), which led, as in many other cases in Africa [<a href="#R18">18</a>] to a deep mistrust between the population at large and the police force. The need
                                       to adopt community policing is therefore a result of both external and internal pressures.
                                       The external pressures originate from the international community, and are essentially
                                       in relation to democratisation, liberalisation, security sector reform and post-conflict
                                       reconstruction processes, demands and conditionalities [<a href="#R10">10</a>], while the internal pressures are instigated by the people of Uganda, as well as
                                       various advocacy groups, including civil and political, in relation to human security
                                       and rights ([<a href="#R1">1</a>], p.&nbsp;1). At the bottom of adopting COP approaches lies the need to transform the
                                       police (or at the very least, the public discourse and image of the police) from a
                                       top-down institution used by the state to enforce public order on behalf of elites,
                                       ([<a href="#R10">10</a>], p.&nbsp;74) to an institution that applies COP concepts to prevent crime and disorder
                                       by creating a partnership through cooperation with communities to identify contextual
                                       priorities and act as a public service [<a href="#R1">1</a>, <a href="#R50">50</a>, <a href="#R54">54</a>].
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e595">In his assessment of COP in transitional societies, Brogden [<a href="#R3">3</a>, <a href="#R10">10</a>] examined the state of COP in Uganda in 2005 and labelled it as a failure. Linking
                                       his analysis to broader study on the application of COP around the world [<a href="#R5">5</a>] and a more specific evaluation study of policing in Uganda conducted by DFID [<a href="#R2">2</a>], Brogden [<a href="#R3">3</a>] argues that first and foremost COP was introduced in Uganda as a Western-style policing
                                       scheme, detached from contextual, social and political realities [<a href="#R55">55</a>]. The basis of COP in Uganda is linked to the introduction of the ideas of ‘sensitising
                                       the public’ through mobilisation by a British police training team who resided in
                                       the country between 1986 and 1990 and assisted in training and recruitment of police
                                       officers ([<a href="#R3">3</a>], p.&nbsp;642). This initiative was followed by a larger British assistance project which
                                       began in 1993 as a national program and included assistance to the UPF to train officers
                                       in COP [<a href="#R2">2</a>, <a href="#R3">3</a>, <a href="#R56">56</a>]. Te project led to the training and introduction of Community Liaison Officers (CLOs)
                                       nationally [<a href="#R57">57</a>]. But due to lack of resources and subsequent structural problems, the attempt to
                                       implement COP was regarded as a failure [<a href="#R2">2</a>] for a number of reasons including: developing COP in tandem with crime intelligence
                                       gathering efforts which led to public distrust; applying COP through instruction of
                                       communities rather than cooperation with them; failure to distinguish between rural
                                       and urban contexts and needs of communities; and not dedicating adequate resources
                                       for the police and for officers to facilitate and motivate their work and competence
                                       [<a href="#R58">58</a>].
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e638">Following the report, the ministry of internal affairs in Uganda relaunched the program
                                       with an emphasis on crime prevention panels and neighbourhood watch groups [<a href="#R59">59</a>]. The initiative included concrete action such as community efforts to monitor and
                                       protect property assisted by the police, training of crime preventers, dissemination
                                       of information and sensitisation of the public with the assistance of the media, and
                                       continued relationship with the community through a CLO appointed to each district
                                       [<a href="#R56">56</a>]. This initiative was evaluated in 2003 by Asan Kasingye, the Commissioner of Police
                                       for Community Affairs [<a href="#R60">60</a>]. His conclusions were similar to the conclusions outlined in 1998 by the DFID evaluation
                                       project [<a href="#R2">2</a>], namely that COP has had very little concrete impact on the ground ([<a href="#R50">50</a>], pp.&nbsp;108–109) ([<a href="#R56">56</a>], p.&nbsp;23) [<a href="#R60">60</a>]. Kasingye suggested that to have an effective COP approach in Uganda, the UPF should
                                       better integrate the communities in the overly police-centred approach, including
                                       selecting and training community members, improve the integration of COP modules in
                                       police training; and selecting better qualified CLO’s for the programme [<a href="#R60">60</a>]. The Commissioner also highlighted that one of the main obstacles to the application
                                       of effective COP in Uganda remains the deep mistrust of the public in the police,
                                       viewed as violent, corrupt, and serving state elites rather than the public.

                                    <p id="d1e665">In 2008 the minister of internal affairs relaunched COP once again, framing it as
                                       the core principle of policing in Uganda. COP programs became the responsibility of
                                       the Directorate of Political Commissariat which has the primary function <i>‘to develop a patriotic, citizen centric police force through engagement in education
                                          and community policing’</i> [<a href="#R61">61</a>]. As the core principle of UPF policing, COP was embedded into the command structure
                                       of the UPF from the regional to the post level [<a href="#R59">59</a>, <a href="#R62">62</a>]. As a result, CLO’s were assigned to all districts and divisions, and nationwide
                                       neighbourhood watch schemes were implemented [<a href="#R62">62</a>]. The police anticipated that the application of COP would enable them to rely on
                                       community resources to assist fighting crime and improve police intelligence gathering

                                       today considering the centenary celebrations and the President’s vision. This renewed
                                       commitment for COP as the central concept for the UPF prompted the articulation of
                                       a national strategy document for community policing published in January 2017 [<a href="#R1">1</a>]. This comprehensive document provides a solid background and reasoning for the implementation
                                       of COP in Uganda, and spells out the strategic goals and implementation strategy as
                                       summarised in the introduction above. It is against this background that this research
                                       sought to investigate how- and the extent to which -COP is being implemented in Gulu.

                              <p id="d1e714">This study was conducted in 2018-2019 focusing on various urban and peri-urban contexts
                                 in Gulu municipality. It followed a qualitative design and included document analysis
                                 in the Gulu archives, semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions and participant
                                 observation through joining a police patrol. A total of forty-five semi structured
                                 interviews were conducted with key informants, including police officers on all levels
                                 (regional/district/station/post), local government officials in Gulu district (LC
                                 1-3), community, cultural and religious leaders, members of the community, crime preventers,
                                 NGOs, and current/former members of criminal groups. In addition, we conducted four
                                 FGDs, two with members of the community in two randomly chosen divisions of Gulu municipality
                                 [<a href="#R65">65</a>], and two FGD with current/former members of a criminal group [<a href="#R66">66</a>]. Each FGD comprised of 5-7 participants.
                                 Since Gulu town was undergoing quick changes in preparation for receiving a city status,
                                 the working hypothesis was that the UPF was engaged in an effort to establish the
                                 appropriate infrastructure for this upcoming change, and therefore the Strategy for
                                 Community Policing would be applied to certain extents.

                              <p id="d1e727">Before we outline how- and the extent to which -COP is applied in Gulu, we begin with
                                 a brief historical overview and the current sources of crime and insecurity as expressed
                                 by respondents.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e729">As was often indicated during interviews, the current character of Gulu seems to be
                                 largely defined by the civil war that took place in Northern Uganda between 1986-2006.
                                 This conflict between the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) and the Ugandan People’s Defence
                                 Force (UPDF) led to a social-cultural crisis exacerbated by a large-scale displacement
                                 of the Acholi people who inhabit the region. Branch [<a href="#R67">67</a>] describes how the conflict, displacement, aid, and reconstruction efforts, eventually
                                 transformed Gulu from a small provincial town to a main hub during and after the war
                                 [<a href="#R67">67</a>]. While the conflict in Northern Uganda ended in 2006, the ripple effects of the
                                 war are still upsetting the Acholi people today. During our interviews, most respondents
                                 highlighted that post-conflict Gulu suffers from two major sources of insecurity,
                                 both directly linked, as they described, to the conflict. Firstly, many Acholi believe
                                 that they are frowned upon by the other ethnic groups inhabiting Uganda, not only
                                 because of historic, racial, and cultural tensions, but also because the leader of
                                 the LRA, Joseph Kony, is an Acholi. Despite the fact that the Acholi of Northern Uganda
                                 were the primary casualties of the LRA rebellion, people believe that the ethnic group
                                 as a collective is a victim of a lingering stigma based on Kony’s ethnic identity
                                 as Acholi. Secondly, many of the Acholi who fled during the conflict [<a href="#R67">67</a>] left behind their lands, homes, and property. This is also the case for those who
                                 chose to remain behind, as they were forcibly displaced by the GoU, and gathered in
                                 camps during the conflict years [<a href="#R68">68</a>]. The latter was carried out by the Ugandan security forces, and in an effort to
                                 ‘protect’ civilians from the conflict and flesh out LRA sympathisers to help cut-off
                                 Kony’s access to what was believed to be his support base and logistical lifeline
                                 ([<a href="#R69">69</a>], p.&nbsp;77). As a consequence, many Acholi lost access to their main sources of livelihood
                                 and security, their land. When the conflict subsided in 2006, the returning population
                                 encountered a series of difficulties regarding the lands they left behind. Some found
                                 that their lands had been settled by others. Many could not recall the exact demarcation
                                 and size of their plots; some were offspring of landowners that perished in the war
                                 and now their rights to land were not recognised. Yet others entered conflicts with
                                 other family members and neighbours about the ownership of plots. Coupled with poor
                                 parcel demarcations and no deeds, many Acholi could not at the time the conflict ended,
                                 and many still cannot today, reclaim their lost properties. Much has been written
                                 about land tenure in Northern Uganda as a result of the conflict and subsequent struggles
                                 and insecurity linked to land issues [<a href="#R70">70</a>]. Re-visiting this content is beyond the scope of this paper, but it is important
                                 to emphasise here that disagreements about land ownership and access to land is considered
                                 today both by local authorities and the people inhabiting the Gulu district, as the
                                 most important source of insecurity, conflict and crime plaguing society today.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e750">While land tenure issues are a civil matter and disagreements are handled by civil
                                 courts and traditional mechanisms, crime related to land conflicts is a police concern.
                                 The span of criminal acts that the UPF in Gulu and the local population link in their
                                 narratives to land conflicts and insecurity around land tenure issues is staggering.
                                 The accounts told by the UPF and respondents from the Gulu district, link land tenure
                                 to livelihood insecurities and subsequently to crime. In essence, these can be divided
                                 into two main categories: crimes directly linked to land conflicts, and crimes linked
                                 to lack of access to sustainable livelihoods due to loss of land rights. While not
                                 all crimes described below occurs in relation to land conflicts, nor stem from livelihood
                                 insecurity due to loss of land, most participants in this research, police as well
                                 as community, still relate crime in Gulu to the LRA insurgency and the subsequent
                                 loss of access to land experienced by many Acholi. It is clear though, that the UPF
                                 and the population in Gulu often point to the conflict in one way or another when
                                 they explain most contemporary causes of crime related challenges in the Gulu district.
                                 This understanding cuts across the levels of the UPF command hierarchy from the regional,
                                 through the district and down to the officer level at posts, and from the community
                                 side, from local government, through the cultural and religious leadership to individual
                                 members in the various communities.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e752">Criminal acts directly related to land disputes include theft, assault, arson, and
                                 murder. These are carried out by the disputing parties, by the families and relatives
                                 of disputing parties, or by others hired by the disputing parties to exert pressure
                                 or revenge. Those hired by disputing parties are local street children or adults,
                                 individuals or organised in gangs, who are ready to conduct criminal acts in exchange
                                 for money [<a href="#R42">42</a>]. Criminal acts related to lack of access to livelihood opportunities are described
                                 as connected to the need to survive (for example theft or prostitution) and/or activities
                                 people engage in to enter an alternate state of mind to forget their troubles for
                                 a short while, or due to boredom and despair (for example alcoholism, drug use, defilement,
                                 assault). One of the major concerns of both the UPF and the community is related to
                                 the use of illegal substances by youth, including chewing khat, smoking marihuana,
                                 and smoking opium. In addition, the consumption of alcohol and illegal betting are
                                 seen as major sources of concern. These are often viewed as activities linked to lack
                                 of abilities and/or opportunities to secure a livelihood, boredom, despair and laziness
                                 of the younger generation, and the underlying causes for assault, rape, defilement,
                                 and murder.

                              <p id="d1e760">As we interviewed several police officials in Gulu, from senior command on the regional
                                 level to officers in posts, it became evident that that there are significant gaps
                                 in the levels of education, knowledge, and familiarity with the concept of COP. While
                                 commanders and officers on the regional, district and station levels where familiar
                                 with the concept and history of COP in Uganda to various degrees, some officers on
                                 the lower ranks, and especially on the post levels where not so familiar with the
                                 concept nor with the UPF 2017 Strategy for Community Policing.
                                 As a point of departure, the senior command on the regional and district levels in
                                 Gulu indicated that the Strategy for Community Policing was not yet being applied
                                 systematically in Gulu. The main reasons given were lack of time and resources to
                                 engage in systematic planning to operationalise the strategy in Gulu. Nevertheless,
                                 the concept and its objectives as specified in the strategy were familiar to the senior
                                 command, and some levels of activity and specific measures where highlighted as COP
                                 interventions as discussed below.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e762">COP is understood by the senior command as a measure for proactive intervention for
                                 crime prevention and the reduction of reactive policing measures explained as ‘fire
                                 extinguishing’ [<a href="#R71">71</a>].

                              <p id="d1e767">In order to engage in proactive prevention, as explained to us, it is essential for
                                 the police to come closer to the community, and most importantly, find ways to reduce
                                 the fear from the police that the public holds by initiating an ‘open communication
                                 channel and give the public information’ [<a href="#R71">71</a>]. The main objectives of COP presented by senior command in Gulu included getting
                                 closer to the community, sensitise people, getting people used to the presence of-
                                 and encourage interaction with -the police, and being able to build trust with the
                                 community that would enable the police to access information about crime and criminal
                                 activities.

                              <p id="d1e772">One senior police commander who conducted COP training in the UK told us that he is:
                                 <i>aware that Uganda policing style is different from the European. Community engagement
                                    in Uganda is about addressing crime, while in other places [in the world] it is about

                              <p id="d1e780">This official also explained that in Uganda, police officers are not trusted by the
                                 public and are not safe while conducting their work. The official clarified that police
                                 officers in Uganda are under constant risk of attack by local people, and therefore
                                 police and police officers never operate alone. One of the main challenges for the
                                 implementation of COP, according to the senior police official, is that the police
                                 in Uganda is primarily a top-down institution, and the main instructions and policies
                                 come from the police headquarters in Kampala where patterns are analysed and where
                                 training manuals and instructions for each police level, state/regional/district/post,
                                 are written. He explained that in essence, COP in Uganda is mostly about working and
                                 engaging with the community to solve crime. In its basic form, COP is cooperation
                                 work with the community where ‘the public is the police and the police is the public’

                              <p id="d1e785">The police flagged several interactions with the community as COP related strategies
                                 that are currently applied to different extents in Gulu. These were described as:
                                 joint patrols, Mayumba Kumi, crime preventers, partnership with NGOs, public sensitisation,
                                 bylaws enforcement, and direct access to police command. In the following sections
                                 we outline these strategies as we observed them, incorporating both the police and
                                 the community inputs/perspectives on them.

                                    <p id="d1e790">The police leadership in Gulu flagged joint foot patrols with the community as one
                                       of the most significant manifestation of COP operationalisation in Gulu. Joint foot
                                       patrols are initiated by the police and incorporate community leadership at the LC1
                                       level, and more specifically the holders of the title Secretary of Defence at the
                                       LC1 level. Holders of these titles are responsible for security in their community
                                       and are in close contact with the CLO at the district level. As part of this research
                                       we participated in a joint foot patrol in Gulu town. As such, the following account
                                       is based both on participant observations, as well as unstructured interviews with
                                       all other participants in the patrol. The six-hour patrol was initiated by the police
                                       and began at 20:00 at Gulu police station. It included three uniformed police officers
                                       armed with AK47s and three LC1 secretaries of defence. The patrol was led by a ranking
                                       police officer in civilian clothing. The patrol walked in a single file, headed by
                                       the LC1 secretaries of defence, followed by the police officer in charge, the research
                                       team, and the armed uniformed police officers. The purpose of the patrol as stated
                                       in the briefing, was to show presence, visit locations where potential issues may
                                       arise, interact with members of the community, and intervene if issues may arise.
                                       The police officer in charge explained that such patrols are common in Gulu town.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e792">The patrol seemed to attract much attention in the street, perhaps due to the presence
                                       of the research team. There were three types of interventions during this specific
                                       patrol that illustrate community/police relations, bearing in mind that the joint
                                       patrol is considered a COP application by the police. The first type of interventions
                                       were random stops made by the officer in charge to interact with groups of individuals
                                       in the street. The second type of interventions were planned stops in ‘drinking joints’
                                       where those present on location were ask to gather and listen to an ad-hoc sensitisation
                                       session led by the officer in charge. And the third intervention was an arrest made
                                       by the officer in charge.

                                          <p id="d1e797">The ranking police officer made a couple random stops during the patrol to interact
                                             with groups of men sitting in street corners. He presented himself and explained that
                                             this is a joint police/community patrol where LC1 secretaries of defence accompany
                                             the police. The officer explained to the men that the patrol is conducted for the
                                             safety of the people and then asked them if they saw any suspicious or criminal activity.
                                             When there was no response, the officer encouraged people to report criminal and suspicious
                                             activities to the police. In those instances, there were no replies, other than head
                                             nodding on behalf of the men in the street, and there were no further interactions
                                             as the patrol proceeded.

                                          <p id="d1e802">As indicated by the name, ‘drinking joints’ are locations where people can sit, buy
                                             alcoholic beverages and interact. Drinking joints often look like improvised localities,
                                             mainly outdoors, consisting of a counter or shed and a few tables and chairs. The
                                             three locations we visited during the patrol were located in the peri-urban areas
                                             of Gulu town, away from the town centre. The police and some members of the community
                                             consider ‘drinking joints’ as localities where trouble potentially arises. These places
                                             are popular and known for serving alcohol, betting, and smoking illegal substances.
                                             The LC1 defence secretaries who are familiar with the location of ‘drinking joints’
                                             led the patrol to the specific sites we visited. The police officer in charge explained
                                             that most police personnel in Gulu are not locals and do not know the area well enough.
                                             It is therefore crucial to have joint patrols with community leadership such as the
                                             LC1 defence secretaries, as they can lead the police to potently problematic localities,
                                             help locate specific people, and inform the police of certain problematic activities
                                             taking place.
                                          </p>
                                          <p id="d1e804">The stops the patrol made in ‘drinking joints’ can be characterised as ad-hoc sensitisation
                                             sessions. Upon arrival to the ‘drinking joint’, the armed police officers scattered
                                             around the perimeter, while the LC1 defence secretaries gathered around the people
                                             in the vicinity of the ‘drinking joint’. The armed police officers helped gather people
                                             who did not join the rest when the LC1 asked them to do so. The commanding officer
                                             of the patrol then proceeded with a speech to all those gathered. He began by presenting
                                             himself and specified that this was a joint police/community patrol with community
                                             leaders present. He then proceeded to talk about crimes that occur as a result of
                                             consumption of alcohol, drugs and betting away money in card games. He urged all those
                                             present not to engage in such activities and asked people to be vigilant and report
                                             crime when they are aware of it. He then distributed his phone number and told people
                                             that they could call him directly if they had information about crime and criminal
                                             activities, or if they needed help. While some people present seemed disinterested
                                             and bothered by this intervention, others took the opportunity to raise some issues
                                             with the police and LC1 present, and especially in relation to the local bylaws introduced
                                             by the LCs. As explained to us, each level of Local Council can introduce bylaws with
                                             the purpose of reducing risk for crime and disturbances. As part of the cooperation
                                             between the police and community leaders, the police help enforce local bylaws. Very
                                             often these bylaws revolve around noise and music playing after certain hours, serving
                                             alcohol after certain hours, and curfews. Such bylaws existed in the localities we
                                             visited, and people present, including owners of ‘drinking joints’ complained to the
                                             police against those bylaws, emphasising that these are not the laws of Uganda and
                                             therefore unacceptable. The commanding officer offered his sympathy and understanding
                                             to the complaints, but explained that these bylaws are in place for the benefit of
                                             the community, and they are in place in order to ensure the collective peace, reduce
                                             the potential for crime, and to ensure that people do not stay out late, stop drinking
                                             early, go home early, and be able to perform at work the next day. He also emphasised
                                             that ultimately, it is up to every person to learn how to manage him/herself.

                                          <p id="d1e809">During the patrol a spontaneous arrest of youth suspected of drug use was made by
                                             the commanding officer. As we observed this arrest, we noted a number of instances
                                             relevant to the community/police relations. The arrest was made when a group of three
                                             youth, two boys and one girl, passed the patrol. When they passed the commanding officer,
                                             he grabbed one of the boys by the arm, and ordered the other police officers to stop
                                             the two others. A few seconds later two more boys and three girls were also apprehended
                                             while they walked by the patrol. The commanding officer told the boy he grabbed that
                                             he could smell opium on his breath and proceeded to search the boy. The search uncovered
                                             a pack of opium. The officers conducted a search on the second boy and girl (who turned
                                             out to be underage) and found no drugs on them but could smell it on their breath.
                                             The officer then proceeded to question the two other groups of youth they detained.
                                             The three girls were released almost immediately, while the two boys were searched
                                             and detained further, though no substances were found on them. It is worth highlighting
                                             a number of elements we observed during this process. Firstly, the LC1 defences secretaries
                                             were actively involved in the detention (physically holding) of the youth, as well
                                             as with the searches done. Secondly, police officers and LC1 alike used intimidation,
                                             soft violence (grabbing arms and hands, shouting in their faces, waving fingers) and
                                             derogatory language towards the youth during the entire processes. The youth were
                                             called names, including ‘dangerous criminals’, ‘animals’, ‘gangsters’, and were told
                                             that they were all going to prison. In addition, one of the armed police officers
                                             pointed at several pieces of jewellery (chains and rings) worn by the person who owned
                                             the opium package and ordered him to remove the jewellery. The police officer then
                                             placed the jewellery in his own pocket. We were told that this was standard procedure,
                                             though there was no indication of registration, and as the events unfolded, the jewellery
                                             was not returned.

                                          <p id="d1e811">As we waited for the motorised patrol to join us for the purpose of taking the detained
                                             youth back to the police station, the commanding officer decided to release the two
                                             additional boys apprehended earlier. The LC1 then ordered the boys to lay down on
                                             the floor to be caned as punishment, but the commanding officer intervened and said,
                                             ‘there will be no caning here today, let them go’, and the boys ran away as fast as
                                             they could. The initial group of two boys and the underaged girl were taken by the
                                             motorised patrol escorted by the commanding officer to the Gulu police station. When
                                             the officer came back, approximately an hour later, we were told that the two boys
                                             escaped the vehicle while the girl remained in custody and would spend the night at

                                    <p id="d1e816">During our interviews with police officials, we were informed that a pilot Mayumba
                                       Kumi project was established in Gulu district as part of the application of the COP
                                       strategy. Mayumba Kumi literally means ‘ten households’ and it is a widespread concept
                                       in Africa [<a href="#R12">12</a>, <a href="#R73">73</a>, <a href="#R74">74</a>, <a href="#R75">75</a>].
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e830">Mayumba Kumi is essentially a type of neighbourhood watch, where a group of households
                                       [<a href="#R76">76</a>] establish a security watch scheme based on their intimate knowledge of the neighbourhood
                                       and the people who live and frequent it. The concept is anchored in the social connectedness
                                       that characterises many communities across the African continent, where social cohesion
                                       and interdependence is a key cultural aspect [<a href="#R77">77</a>]. In recent years, Mayumba Kumi has become an explicit community policing strategy
                                       through which the police encourages the community to form clusters where neighbours
                                       observe and report suspicious activities, unknown people in the neighbourhood, and
                                       any unusual movements in their environments to each other and to the selected leader
                                       of the cluster ([<a href="#R12">12</a>], p.&nbsp;22).
                                       
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e841">In Gulu, police officials informed us that Mayumba Kumi is applied as a pilot project
                                       in one location. The current application as described by the police, was a grouping
                                       of ten households headed by a selected leader that respected the local LC1. This leader
                                       receives information from members of the group and informs the LC1 if issues arise.
                                       The LC1 (or LC1 defence secretary) attempts to solve issues, and if he is unable to
                                       do so, he involves the police. The organisation of this group, according to the police,
                                       began through a meeting between the CLO, the leader, and members of the group for
                                       sensitisation purposes. The group of households is intended to function as a monitoring
                                       team, perform local patrols and inform the police and LC1 defence secretaries about
                                       the patrol. The intention is that the LC1 defence secretaries and sometimes the police,
                                       join local patrols. Police officials explained to us that often the police do not
                                       have the resources to conduct or join local patrols, and in this way, the community
                                       patrols the neighbourhood and calls the police if there are issues that need intervention.

                                    <p id="d1e843">In practice, the Mayumba Kumi pilot does not fully function as described and intended,
                                       nor was it a recent pilot initiated by the police. As we spoke to members of the Mayumba
                                       Kumi, we were informed that the group comprises of fewer than ten neighbouring households
                                       that communicate and inform each other of any unusual issues in their area. If issues
                                       arise, the LC1 secretary of defence examines the situation and calls the police if
                                       necessary. There were no neighbourhood patrols, nor joint patrols. We were also informed
                                       that these household practiced this sort of communication before they were labelled
                                       as a Mayumba Kumi pilot project by the police. Indeed, Mayumba Kumi is a long-standing
                                       practice, and documents in the Gulu archive [<a href="#R78">78</a>] indicate that Mayumba Kumi was practiced in the region since 1979. The practice
                                       of Myumba Kumi in Uganda dates back at least to the Godfrey Binaisa regime (June 1979-May
                                       1980), when the temporary parliament, the National Consultative Council (NCC), established
                                       the Mayumba Kumi system to monitor rising crimes in neighbourhoods [<a href="#R79">79</a>]. These historical groups, dubbed in Gulu as the ‘Mayumba Kumi vigilante groups’
                                       [<a href="#R78">78</a>], where supported by Tanzanian soldiers who helped overthrow the Amin regime [<a href="#R79">79</a>]. But many Ugandans considered the activities of the Mayumba Kumi groups as harassment
                                       [<a href="#R78">78</a>]. The current practice of Mayumba Kumi in Gulu is somewhat different than the original
                                       vigilante groups and includes mobile phone communication and reporting amongst the
                                       members of the group, communication with the police, and mobilisation and intervention
                                       if needed. Through this sort of communication practices in the region (though not
                                       by this Mayumba Kumi group), the presence, movement and location of the research team
                                       was repeatedly reported to officials in the region, including LCs on higher levels,
                                       the Resident District Commissioner, and senior police officials. This information
                                       was given to us during interviews with officials who told us that they were informed
                                       of visits we made to different locations.

                                    <p id="d1e863">When we interviewed police officials in Gulu, the crime preventers scheme was not
                                       mentioned as a COP intervention. Nevertheless, issues related to the use of crime
                                       preventers by the police and local government officials were mentioned by community
                                       members in interviews and FGDs. We followed up this information with the police and
                                       subsequently interviewed crime preventers for this research. The recent manifestation
                                       of the crime preventers scheme was introduced by President Museveni as a community
                                       policing initiative in 2014 [<a href="#R34">34</a>, <a href="#R41">41</a>, <a href="#R80">80</a>, <a href="#R81">81</a>, <a href="#R82">82</a>], but the most significant round of recruitment of crime preventers occurred before
                                       the 2016 general elections in Uganda ([<a href="#R80">80</a>], p.&nbsp;9). While flagged as a community policing initiative by the President, it became
                                       evident that crime preventers were recruited by the NRM to serve as a tool of power
                                       to secure the elections ([<a href="#R41">41</a>], p.&nbsp;699). As such, crime preventers assumed a partisan role and were seen and understood
                                       by the public at large as NRM agents ([<a href="#R80">80</a>], p.&nbsp;9)([<a href="#R41">41</a>], p.&nbsp;700). As a result, crime preventers were not really perceived as civilians recruited
                                       from the community to improve community/police relations and help the police provide
                                       a better service to the community, but rather as a group of people that could easily
                                       embed themselves in communities on behalf of the NRM and provide information to the
                                       authorities, including information about political dissidence, but also engage in
                                       coordinated action on behalf of the NRM when necessary. Tapscott ([<a href="#R41">41</a>], p.&nbsp;700) indicates that increasingly, the crime preventers were assigned controversial
                                       tasks by the police, including effectuating arrests.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e896">Crime preventers were mentioned to us in the context of their unpopularity and in
                                       relation to tasks they still perform on behalf of the police. In 2018-2019 when we
                                       conducted this research, we were told that the status and role of crime preventers
                                       was officially abolished. They no longer functioned as a group, nor used by the NRM
                                       in an official capacity. Nevertheless, community members, local government officials,
                                       and later police officials told us that while crime preventers as an organised group
                                       were no longer functional, individuals trained and identified as crime preventers
                                       were occasionally used by the police and local government official to execute certain
                                       tasks. These tasks, which all seemed to potentially involve the use of force or violence,
                                       included effectuating arrests on behalf of the police, searching for wanted individuals
                                       for the police and local government officials, and sometimes guarding or conducting
                                       specific acts of violence on behalf of various individuals. One community member labelled
                                       them as ‘criminals with licenses’ that often resort to violence in their interactions
                                       on behalf of officials [<a href="#R83">83</a>].
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e901">Police and local government officials explained that in certain situations it is better
                                       and safer to use crime preventers who are from the community and are familiar with
                                       local contexts rather than using police officers. An example given was in conjunction
                                       of arresting drunk individuals who behaved in a disorderly fashion in a pub. Uniformed
                                       police officers who were called to the scene were reluctant to enter the premises
                                       as they feared a mob reaction against them. In this case and similar cases, the police
                                       calls upon crime preventers and asks them effectuate arrests, stop the disorderly
                                       behaviour, and bring the drunk individuals out by force.

                                       application of the COP strategy. More specifically, such relationships are viewed
                                       as building partnerships with the community, participation in neighbourhood-based
                                       problem solving, embracing the ideal of community service, and securing resources

                                       Both the police and the NGOs describe this relationship as mutually beneficial for
                                       a variety of reasons. Senior police officials explained that the NGOs provide both
                                       material benefits and access that helps the police to be more efficient in their work.
                                       Some examples of material benefits include NGOs providing the police with office materials,

                                       for police-public interactions, providing gasoline for police vehicles, direct support
                                       for offices of interests (e.g. office for child and family) etc. In terms of access,
                                       NGOs conduct regular public sensitisation activities, and invites police officials
                                       to speak directly to the community through such events.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e910">The NGOs explained that providing the police with material benefits has a double effect.
                                       Firstly, they help the underfunded and under-resourced police with materials that
                                       are necessary in providing good services to the community. Fuel for vehicles is essential
                                       for police mobility, and often the cost of a resource such as fuel is transferred
                                       to plaintiffs who require police assistance. Secondly, as indicted clearly by the
                                       NGOs, assisting the police with material benefits leads to a closer relationship that
                                       enables NGOs to mobilise police resources to assist them in particular cases of interest.
                                       One example given was in cases of GBV when police intervention is needed, the NGOs
                                       contact the police directly and the police mobilises quickly and efficiently assisting
                                       the NGO due to the special relationship that exists. While this is certainly a <i>quid pro quo</i> relationship, it is an outcome of the reality on the ground, and the results of these
                                       practices which can be viewed as ethically challenging, are better and more efficient
                                       services to the community. In addition, NGOs view police participation in sensitisation
                                       events as an important measure for trust building and information sharing with the
                                       community.

                                       contact with the public through dissemination activities. There are several direct

                                    <p id="d1e940">There are several planned and ad-hoc circumstances where the police meets the public
                                       for interaction and information sharing. These include planned police sensitisation
                                       activities, activities planned by others where the police are invited to contribute,
                                       meeting the public during patrols (as described above), radio time dedicated for the
                                       police, participation of police officials in other radio programs, and information
                                       through the written media, posters and announcements.
                                       Bylaws enforcement is an important service rendered by the police to the community
                                       leadership. As specified above, bylaws are local rules that community leadership installs
                                       to increase the peace, respect of rights and property, reduce the risk for criminal
                                       activities, minimise exposure of people, and especially youth, to potentially harmful
                                       substances such as drugs and alcohol, and respect cultural and religious norms. These
                                       bylaws include curfews such as time limits for noise, limits on selling of alcohol,
                                       or limits on being in certain areas at certain times. While the police is committed
                                       to assist the various communities in enforcing such bylaws, there are not always enough
                                       resources to do so. Very often it is the community leadership that attempts to enforce
                                       bylaws, and the police are called, and sometimes assist, in radical cases or if they
                                       happen to be in the area.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e942">One common practice by police officers of all ranks, including senior leadership,
                                       is to provide their personal phone numbers to people at large. As such, many people
                                       have the ability to call a number of police officers directly and provide information,
                                       report crimes, or ask for assistance. Virtually all community leaders have direct
                                       access via mobile phones to senior police leadership in Gulu, especially the CLO.
                                       While senior leadership does not always answer calls from unknown individuals, they
                                       will eventually reply to community leadership, or assign another officer to contact
                                       the caller.

                              <p id="d1e947">In this section we assess the practice of COP in Gulu, bearing in mind Tapscott’s
                                 suggestion discussed above that the GoU applies institutionalised arbitrariness in
                                 its interactions with the citizens through security provision [<a href="#R34">34</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e952">As the data indicates, in general, members of the community view the police as an
                                 agent of the government, and as outsiders to their communities. There is a fundamental
                                 distrust of police officers as they are regarded as corrupt, sometimes violent, and
                                 unpredictable [<a href="#R84">84</a>]. The views of the police as an agent of the government acting on behalf of elites
                                 rather than providers of public service for the people of Uganda is not new [<a href="#R5">5</a>, <a href="#R30">30</a>], and it is anchored in years of experience of Ugandans with state security providers
                                 under various regimes. In this sense, it seems that COP has achieved very little since
                                 1989 regarding building a partnership between the police and the public. Indeed, shifting
                                 this perception of the police as an agent of the government acting first and foremost
                                 to secure the interests of elites is difficult, especially when people frequently
                                 observe the role the police fulfils on behalf of the government in subduing political
                                 dissidence and opposition. During our stay in Gulu, for example, we observed police
                                 mobilisation to provide security for what people at large considered as a political
                                 harassment of the very popular opposition leader known as Bobi Wine [<a href="#R85">85</a>]. The police in Gulu played a prominent role in these events and other similar subsequent
                                 events [<a href="#R85">85</a>, <a href="#R86">86</a>] as ordered by the government. During our interactions with community members, the
                                 example of Bobi Wine was given and discussed several times in the context of politicised
                                 policing in Uganda, highlighting the basic mistrust that exists between people and
                                 the UPF. In addition, people reported events where the police in Gulu used intimidation
                                 by shooting in the air and the use of tear gas to disperse gatherings and protests,
                                 as well as the use of live ammunition in riot control in Gulu [<a href="#R87">87</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e976">Respondents also report that the police often extract money from citizens [<a href="#R88">88</a>], especially around holidays through bogus fines. Local leaders also told us that
                                 in many cases they have personally informed the police about the location of criminals,
                                 and in several cases accompanied the police to effectuate arrests of known criminals,
                                 but then a few days later the criminals would be back in the streets. This happens,
                                 according to members of the community, due to bribery and corruption. As one local
                                 leader put it: ‘if you have money, you can buy your way out of any crime’. Another
                                 example of what is viewed by the community as extortion, is when the police requires
                                 from the plaintiffs to pay for fuel and other expenses as a condition to follow up
                                 on complaints that require police mobilisation.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e981">As we observed during sensitisation stops in ‘drinking joints’ while on patrol, the
                                 uniformed police officers armed with AK47 scatter around the permitter and gather
                                 people, requiring their participation in the session. While the officer in charges
                                 highlights partnership with the community during his speech, armed police officers
                                 surround the permitter and force people to participate. This sends a double message
                                 to the public and conveys an aura of intimidation.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e983">The arrest effectuated during the patrol also demonstrated how both the police and
                                 local leadership use intimidation, derogatory language and violence when interacting
                                 with the public. One prominent example was the second group of two boys and three
                                 girls detained by the police even though there was no apparent reason to do so. Even
                                 after the police established that two boys had done nothing wrong, they were still
                                 detained and there was an intention to punish them by canning before releasing them.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e985">There are, however, nuances offered by some who presented this general critical view
                                 of the police. Some community members recognise that not all police officers are alike
                                 – ‘some are genuine, and some are not professional and tarnish the name of the force’.
                                 Another respondent added ‘some [police officers] are serious, analyse their environments
                                 and engage in professional work’. Interestingly, many members of the community recognise
                                 that the police is underfunded, under resourced, and acknowledge the difficulties
                                 police officers face in terms of performing their duties under these conditions. One
                                 local leader told us that despite these challenges, the Gulu police station work goes
                                 on. Other community members pointed to the poor living conditions for police officers
                                 and their families in police barracks, the poor salaries, and to the fact that sometimes
                                 salaries are paid late or not paid at all. Some community members expressed understanding
                                 for the corrupt practices as ‘necessary survival methods under these conditions’,
                                 thus blaming the GoU for creating the circumstances where police officers revert to
                                 misusing their powers to extract money from civilians.

                              <p id="d1e987">Despite the entrenched mistrust, local leaders, especially on the LC1 level, are pleased
                                 with their ability to access the police directly. Many members of the public indicate
                                 that they have taken part in sensitisation activities with the police (and NGOs) and
                                 have learned important information about crime and police roles. In addition, many
                                 indicate that some useful information is conveyed, especially through the radio, and
                                 usually in relations to special activities or rules installed during festivities and
                                 special occasions.

                              <p id="d1e989">While some of the measures discussed above can be viewed and analysed as COP interventions
                                 that address the objectives of the COP strategy to certain extents, it seems that
                                 none of these show significant success in improving the perception and image of the
                                 police with the public at large. Indeed, several documents in the Gulu archive indicate
                                 that some of the basic problems that the police in Gulu faces today, are the same
                                 problems that existed in the past [<a href="#R89">89</a>, <a href="#R90">90</a>, <a href="#R91">91</a>, <a href="#R92">92</a>, <a href="#R93">93</a>]. These include first and foremost lack of trust between the community and the police,
                                 the perception of the police as a body that serves the interests of elites, lack of
                                 resources available to the police (such as transport, fuel, office materials, decent
                                 facilities etc), poor training and education of police officers, poor salaries, and
                                 the use of arbitrary violence when dealing with the public. Combined, these lead to
                                 a general public perception of the UPF as corrupt, violent, unpredictable, and untrustworthy.

                              <p id="d1e1006">As specified in the introduction, COP in Uganda is defined through the 2017 strategy
                                 document as both an ‘organisational strategy’ an a ‘new partnership between people
                                 and the police’. The Strategy document justifies COP by linking weak state institutions
                                 in transitional democracies in Africa to enhanced criminal activities, and subsequently
                                 to the need for the police to apply concepts such as COP to better address crime ([<a href="#R1">1</a>], p.&nbsp;3). The objectives of the strategy, namely enabling the police to enhance and
                                 maintain collaboration with the public, work with community to support conflict resolution,
                                 and achieve enhanced public safety, are to be attained through efforts aiming at partnership
                                 building, empowering the police to promote problem solving on the community level,
                                 maintaining integrity, and developing a management strategy that recognises and promotes
                                 COP and its application. The COP concept is framed in the strategy as a state led
                                 initiative.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e1011">There is no doubt that most police officers and senior police command in Gulu are
                                 aware of the COP strategy and its objectives. It is also clear that the UPF in Gulu
                                 has a consistent and sustained relationship, contact, and communication with community
                                 members in general, and local community leadership in particular. But while COP is
                                 acknowledged as the flagship strategy of the UPF, senior police command in Gulu admitted
                                 that they have not made concrete plans to operationalise the 2017 strategy in Gulu.
                                 This was explained both in terms of time (the strategy document was published in January
                                 2017), and lack of resources to plan concrete measures for a wide scale implementation
                                 of the strategy. Nevertheless, the police did list the measures discussed above as
                                 COP interventions that are in place. But it is important to emphasise that these measures
                                 are not new, and not a result of an attempt to implement the 2017 strategy for community
                                 policing, nor were these measures implemented specifically as the operationalisation
                                 of this strategy. Most of the measures for security provision which feature degrees
                                 of collaboration between the community and the police are results of long-standing
                                 governance structures and actions that have been in place as a part of the NRM control
                                 system since 1989 (see for example [<a href="#R30">30</a>]). Some of the interventions labelled by the police as COP were first installed by
                                 the state to enhance or exercise control over the public and collect information through
                                 collaborators rather than collaborate with communities as a service [<a href="#R2">2</a>, <a href="#R3">3</a>, <a href="#R30">30</a>]. The crime preventers scheme, for example, introduced in 2014 as a community policing
                                 initiative by the state, was received by the public as yet another government initiative
                                 to create and empower a group that serves the particular interests of the NRM [<a href="#R41">41</a>, <a href="#R81">81</a>]. As discussed above, individuals that were recruited as crime preventers are widely
                                 resented by the public and the occasional activation of crime preventers by the UPF
                                 in Gulu is not seen as a legitimate form of partnership between the police and the
                                 community. Individuals who were crime preventers are rather viewed as bullies used
                                 to carry out difficult tasks on behalf of the police. While the Mayumba Kumi in Gulu
                                 was originally introduced in the past as a vigilante group [<a href="#R78">78</a>], the contemporary cluster in Gulu was flagged as a ‘pilot’ COP measure by the police.
                                 This specific ‘pilot’ was present and functioned as a community-initiated mechanism
                                 for neighbourhood watch through the LC1 mandate to preserve law and order in the community
                                 [<a href="#R30">30</a>]. The current leader of the Mayumba Kumi cluster welcomes what he described as a
                                 closer contact the group currently shares with the police through the ability to directly
                                 access the CLO and the District Police Commander (DPC) by phone, but emphasised that
                                 the cluster does not rely on the police. The police described the general intention
                                 for a closer collaboration with the community through the Mayumba Kumi scheme, for
                                 example through local patrols, but in practice the current relationship between the
                                 police and this group does not include police participation in patrols initiated by
                                 the LC1.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e1039">The participation of LC1 in joint patrols initiated by the police, however, seem to
                                 represent a close collaboration between the police and local community leadership.
                                 These patrols function both as a measure that empower the community leadership as
                                 they participate in police enforcement (as exemplified by the arrest conducted during
                                 the patrol), as well as through police support to bylaws introduced by the community
                                 leadership. These joint patrols also enable the police to locate potential sources
                                 of disturbances and crime in the community and address them with the assistance of
                                 community leaders. As mentioned above, based on the information we collected, the
                                 police does not usually take part in patrols initiated by the community, but rather
                                 invites community leaders to participate in patrols initiated by the police. In other
                                 words, joint patrols remain a police initiative and are effectuated whenever the police
                                 decides to carry out a patrol.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e1041">As the data indicates, the police co-opts, intervenes, and when it wishes, exercises
                                 control over various measures to provide security in Gulu. The police chooses when
                                 and how to intervene, which measures it labels as COP, and the extent of collaboration
                                 and partnership it exercises with members of the community.

                              <p id="d1e1046">COP as an official state concept of policing has been present in Uganda since 1989
                                 and highlighted by the current regime as a core principle of policing since at least
                                 2008. As of 2014, with another public endorsement by President Museveni during the
                                 one hundred-year celebrations of the police, the UPF has been operating under the
                                 banner of COP, highlighting the (desired) continuous transformation of the police
                                 from an oppressive force (‘colonial policing’) to a public service (‘community policing’).
                                 This renewed commitment led to the inception of a national strategy for community
                                 policing, which is the key document upon which the UPF attempts to operationalise
                                 COP in practice today.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e1048">While examining how this strategy has been operationalised in Gulu municipality between
                                 2018-2019 as part of the preparations for the transformation of Gulu into a city,
                                 it became evident that there are still fundamental gaps between the theory and the
                                 practice of COP. It is also evident that while the discourse of COP is prominent amongst
                                 most police officers, there are significant hindering factors and structural handicaps
                                 that must be addressed if an Ugandan version of COP is to be implemented successfully,
                                 at least in Gulu.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e1050">Most of the interactions between the police and the community which are labelled as
                                 COP interventions today, are rooted in historical practices, most established as forms
                                 of public control by the state for political purposes, intelligence gathering, and
                                 for countering dissidence against the NRM regime. These interventions are not viewed
                                 by the public (and the police) as innovative COP measures established based on an
                                 operationalisation plan to apply the national strategy. Some of these interactions,
                                 such as the use of crime preventers to assist the police, Mayumba Kumi, joint patrols
                                 and sensitisation meetings are essentially ‘old-wine in new bottles’. The police co-opt
                                 or repackages existing schemes based on established governance structures to address
                                 crime and uses the COP framework to flag those as a partnership with community. In
                                 the examples presented here, it is essentially the police that initiates when and
                                 the extent to which they respond to needs of the community.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e1052">On the other hand, some of the new communication channels established between the
                                 police and the public, especially those based on readily available communication technologies
                                 such as mobile phones, allow new forms of direct access to senior police command.
                                 The willingness of many police officers and especially senior command to share their
                                 mobile phone numbers with members of the public is quite commendable. This allows
                                 for personalised contact and access (especially for local community leaders) to the
                                 police and seems to lead to better communication, enhanced trust, and sometimes to
                                 better police responses. Nevertheless, it is unclear according to which criteria the
                                 police responds to direct appeals for interventions by local leadership or community
                                 members when it concerns crime and insecurity in Gulu. It is clear that the police
                                 responds to appeals by NGOs that have a special <i>quid quo pro</i> relationship with the police. And as the data indicates, it is also clear to the
                                 community that the police responds to the priorities of the GoU and mobilises in substantial
                                 forms and with appropriate resources when it concerns protecting the interests of
                                 the government and elites, especially when it comes to public protests against the
                                 NRM or when dealing with political opposition.
                                 
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e1057">If we consider the objectives of the 2017 Strategy for Community Policing, against
                                 the application of COP in Gulu and how the police is perceived and viewed by the community,
                                 it is evident that there are still significant hindrances to building meaningful partnerships
                                 between the police and community. There is evidence that elements of a partnership
                                 are being forged between the police and some community leaders, but most respondents
                                 in this research, including community leaders, still view the police as an agent of
                                 state elites, and police response to community needs as inconsistent and unpredictable.
                                 There is also sustained criticism of the integrity of the police as an organisation,
                                 and of individuals officers within its ranks. Examples of corruption, violence and
                                 abuse of power are ample. And finally, while the practice of COP is a recognised state
                                 philosophy, there were no concrete plans developed in Gulu to operationalise the strategy.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e1059">It is, however, practically impossible to achieve the COP objectives outlined in the
                                 strategy if the police, policing, and COP strategies are coupled with partisan politics,
                                 and measures recognised by the public from the past as actions to exercise control
                                 by the state to secure the interests of elites. In addition, as long as the resources
                                 needed to establish effective, efficient and nonpartisan COP are not invested in the
                                 UPF, there will be no prospects of creating a reliable and innovative service for
                                 the citizens of Uganda. The most basic hindrance to the aspiration of COP as defined
                                 by the UPF, is the basic mistrust that exists between citizens of Uganda and the UPF.
                                 This mistrust is anchored in the control the state exercises over security provision
                                 and the subsequent entrenched understanding by people that police interventions are
                                 not consistent, not reliable, and not concerned with the daily apprehensions of citizens.
                                 But even if the police would go through a de-politicization process, there will still
                                 be a need to consider the substantial lack of resources. Without these resources,
                                 the police will not be able to effectuate basic daily police work for the benefit
                                 of citizens. These include proper salary compensation, access to good living conditions
                                 for officers and their families in police barracks, and access to good support infrastructure
                                 such as facilities, vehicles, fuel, technology etc. As suggested by Tapscott [<a href="#R34">34</a>], as long as the governance structure is focused on entrenching the state as hegemonic
                                 in the citizens’ mind, the only certainty the people have is that the state may intervene
                                 at any time, unpredictably, perhaps violently, and without impunity. Under such conditions,
                                 it will be difficult to create a meaningful partnership between the public and the
                                 UPF through COP.
