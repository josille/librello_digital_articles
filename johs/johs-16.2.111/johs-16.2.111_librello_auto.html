                                 peace support operations. Post-conflict situations are complex, and addressing security
                                 and insecurity issues is therefore challenging. Evaluations, field reports and research
                                 have frequently highlighted challenges related to how assistance is provided in connection
                                 with police reform. A common finding in these evaluations is that police reform programmes
                                 without local ownership and community involvement and support have little chance of
                                 succeeding. Community-oriented policing (COP) has therefore become an important policing
                                 philosophy and strategy in this context. This paper addresses issues related to the
                                 challenges in implementation of police reform by exploring the perennial question
                                 of how police assistance can be better utilised in a sustainable manner in post-conflict
                                 contexts. The paper is divided in two sections. In the first, we identify some key
                                 challenges facing international police assistance. Here we discuss six main challenges
                                 grounded in secondary literature comprising academic research and police mission reports.
                                 In the next section using the example of a broadly based police experts network (PEN)
                                 established in connection with the EU-funded research project ‘Community-Based Policing
                                 and Post-Conflict Police Reform’, the paper discusses how such a network can play
                                 an important role in contributing to policy formation, education and training programme
                                 development for use in police reform projects. The creation of the e-handbook and
                                 e-learning shows the potential for such a network to work and contribute in a cross-disciplinary
                                 manner. Furthermore, we identify four key ways in which this type of network can contribute
                                 to improved international police assistance. The work is exploratory and contributes
                                 to understanding of the complexities of police assistance in post-conflict contexts.</span></div>

                              <p id="d1e105">Police reform in post-conflict [<a href="#R1">1</a>] societies is an increasingly important part of international peace support operations,
                                 and bilateral and multilateral international assistance towards police reform in post-conflict
                                 societies has a long and extensive history. Since the 1990s, peace operations in Namibia,
                                 conducted by the United Nations (UN) such as the Department of Peacekeeping Operations
                                 (DPKO) [<a href="#R2">2</a>] and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), have been heavily involved
                                 in police reform in post-conflict societies [<a href="#R3">3</a>]. The UN is not alone in this effort; other actors, such as the European Union (EU)
                                 through its Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) missions, have supported police
                                 reform in Afghanistan, Kosovo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Somalia. Bilateral donors,
                                 non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and diverse regional organisations are also
                                 involved in these efforts [<a href="#R4">4</a>]. However, the UN is by far the largest contributor to peacekeeping operations when
                                 it comes to numbers of deployed police officers. According to the Center for International
                                 Peace Operations (
                                 <a target="_parent" href="www.zif-berlin.org">www.zif-berlin.org</a>) in its Peace Operations map for 2020/2021, in 2020, the UN Department of Peace (DPO)
                                 deployed 9,000 police officers to 13 peacekeeping operations, and the UN Department
                                 of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs (DPPA) deployed an additional 50 police officers
                                 to its 14 political and peacebuilding missions. The African Union (AU) deployed 1,000
                                 police officers to nine different AU peace operations in Africa, and the EU deployed
                                 400 police officers to 14 EU peace operations outside the EU. Among the almost 12,000
                                 police officers annually deployed to a police reform mission, there are obviously
                                 vast resources of experiences and knowledge to be utilised for future police reform
                                 missions.

                              <p id="d1e122">Reformed national police institutions that abide by the rule of law have an important
                                 role to play in complex and often insecure post-conflict societies. Their impact in
                                 terms of maintaining law and order and providing safety and security for communities
                                 is an important prerequisite for trust-based police-community relations and is crucial
                                 to governments’ legitimacy [<a href="#R5">5</a>]. The development of a professional, accountable, and representative police service
                                 that is capable of serving communities in a democratic way is crucial to the overall
                                 ‘state-building’ project [<a href="#R6">6</a>, <a href="#R7">7</a>, <a href="#R8">8</a>]. Community-oriented policing (COP) has therefore become an important policing strategy
                                 in the context of post-conflict police reform. Nevertheless, evaluations, field reports
                                 and research have repeatedly pointed to challenges related to how assistance has been
                                 provided in connection with police reform and community-based policing in particular
                                 [<a href="#R9">9</a>]. A recurring challenge within international police reform is the inadequacy of local
                                 ownership in the reform processes. A number of researchers have highlighted the importance
                                 of local ownership in the design, advocacy, and execution of police reform [<a href="#R10">10</a>, <a href="#R11">11</a>, <a href="#R12">12</a>]. The advantages of involving local stakeholders are manifold; to do so ‘… enhances
                                 legitimacy, broadens the range of potential supporters of a ‘‘people-oriented’’ form
                                 of SSR, reduces the likelihood of elite capture, and enhances the possibilities for
                                 reconciling local practices and traditions with basic international norms’ [<a href="#R13">13</a>]. Another important challenge in police reform/assistance is involving a diversity
                                 of actors, from both the recipient’s and donor’s sides. This challenge has often led
                                 to issues of coordination and coherence, with each actor serving their own interests.
                                 A concurring challenge is the deployment of advisors and trainers from various police
                                 cultural backgrounds who may not have the necessary qualifications or experience to
                                 work in contexts that are unfamiliar to them [<a href="#R9">9</a>, <a href="#R14">14</a>, <a href="#R15">15</a>]. The key question that this paper addresses is as follows: How can police assistance
                                 be better utilised to facilitate sustainable reform in post-conflict contexts? After
                                 a brief chapter describing the methodology used in this paper, we provide an overview
                                 of police reform and the rationale for police reform and COP in post-conflict societies.
                                 This overview is followed by an examination of the complex challenges related to police
                                 assistance in post-conflict contexts and of how current approaches fall short of sustainable
                                 police reform. We then move to a discussion of how to address some of these shortcomings
                                 through an innovative approach to police assistance, using our experiences from the
                                 pilot police experts network (PEN) developed as a part of an H2020 research project
                                 on police reform. We conclude with a discussion of how the combined know-how of such
                                 a network can be very beneficial to police services that are undergoing transition
                                 and to the development and sustainability of policies, training, and education.

                                 and assistance and is comprised of academic research, police mission reports, evaluation
                                 reports and studies by organisations and media reports. The overlapping nature of
                                 the literature facilitates understanding of the complexities of police reform and

                                 of PEN throughout the project period. It is based on qualitative data obtained through
                                 discussions, interviews and feedback from PEN members over the last five years of
                                 the project period. The project’s annual meetings, workshops, regional meetings and
                                 final disseminations form the bulk of input from the members. In addition, we sent
                                 earlier drafts of the paper to all members for their comments and feedback. Communication
                                 concerning specific topics was conducted through e-mail correspondence.

                              <p id="d1e171">The Norwegian Police University College (PHS) conducted the process of recruitment,
                                 establishing and coordination of the network. PHS contacted researchers and requested
                                 suggestions for potential PEN members to recruit. We also requested international
                                 colleagues to activate their personal networks from previous police reform missions
                                 to suggest possible PEN members. In other words, the PEN coordinator spread the news
                                 that PHS was recruiting police experts to a network. After considerations at PHS,
                                 a formal invitation together with information about the project and conditions for
                                 membership in the network were sent individually to potential PEN members requesting
                                 their acceptance. Therefore, all PEN members were volunteers during the five-year
                                 project period.

                                 The figures in the table represent police personnel, academics and civil society members
                                 recruited to the network. From 2016 until 2020, the membership varied from 45 to 62
                                 persons. The reason for the variation is that some requested to be released from the
                                 network while others were released due to their inability to actively contribute in
                                 a sustained manner. Recruitment of new members was an ongoing process throughout the
                                 project period. Of the 62 individuals who comprised the network, 46 were males while
                                 16 were females coming from 22 different countries. One of the greatest challenges
                                 the network faced was recruiting police personnel from Central America due to language
                                 barriers since very few can communicate in English and because of the fear of and
                                 lack of approval from senior management to become part of a foreign research project.

                              <p id="d1e332">As mentioned above, international assistance that supports security, development,
                                 and human rights is a crucial component of post-conflict programmes. Internal security
                                 is an important prerequisite for economic, social, and political development and a
                                 cornerstone of state-building. As Winkler argued, ‘without security there can simply
                                 be no sustained development, nor any progress towards democracy, stability and peace’
                                 [<a href="#R16">16</a>]. An equally important pillar of state-building and democracy in any society is a
                                 well-functioning, trustworthy, and accountable police service that works with other
                                 rule-of-law institutions. In the words of Caparini and Marenin, ‘a democratic police
                                 and a democratic society exist in symbiosis. Without a supporting democratic context—a
                                 culture of tolerance and trust, a supporting legal framework and a system of functioning
                                 criminal justice institutions—democratic police cannot be created’ [<a href="#R17">17</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e340">The police are thus an important part of a system of governance [<a href="#R18">18</a>, <a href="#R19">19</a>], and police reform is dependent on broader democratic changes in society. But what
                                 do we mean by police reform? According to Eide and Holm, police reform is part of
                                 the ‘law and order triad comprising police forces serving the public, independent
                                 judiciaries, and penal systems’ [<a href="#R20">20</a>]. Numerous police reforms have been implemented throughout Europe and North America
                                 as countries moved away from authoritarian states towards more democratic forms of
                                 government [<a href="#R17">17</a>]. While policing in countries that have undergone major reforms may not always be
                                 fully ‘well-functioning, trustworthy and accountable [<a href="#R21">21</a>], such countries nevertheless aspire to international standards of policing based
                                 on democratic principles.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e357">In post-conflict societies, police reform is particularly challenging and complex.
                                 This complexity is apparent immediately following a conflict, when the transition
                                 from military- to civilian-based security is not well understood. In this transition,
                                 the role and responsibilities of the police are unclear. The examples of Iraq and
                                 Afghanistan highlight this dilemma: on the one hand, the police have to use military
                                 skills to deal with and fight armed insurgencies; on the other hand, they have to
                                 address internal law and order situations. Many scholars have emphasised the advantages
                                 of a clear delineation between these two roles, especially when countries move from
                                 conflict to post-conflict situations [<a href="#R5">5</a>, <a href="#R14">14</a>]. Pino and Wiatrowski argued that ‘… the use of paramilitary police can result in
                                 force being used inappropriately and can alienate a population from the police who
                                 should seek to serve them’ [<a href="#R22">22</a>]. Other scholars have emphasised the dilemmas that result from having a police ‘force’
                                 that can deal with armed insurgents, especially after periods of conflict, when the
                                 situation is fluid. Such scholars cite Iraq and Afghanistan as examples of countries
                                 where armed conflicts and counterinsurgencies are still prevalent and where the boundaries
                                 between the military and police are often ‘blurred’ [<a href="#R23">23</a>, <a href="#R24">24</a>]. This dilemma, namely reform aimed at addressing immediate security issues versus
                                 long-term capacity building to address human security issues, is at the very heart
                                 of police reform in post-conflict societies. According to Bayley, four fundamental
                                 criteria must be met if police reform is to be successful in post-conflict societies:
                                 police must be accountable to law rather than to government; police must protect human
                                 rights, especially those rights that are required for the sort of political activity
                                 that is the hallmark of democracy; police must give top operational priority to servicing
                                 the needs of individual citizens and private groups; and, finally, police should be
                                 transparent in their activities [<a href="#R18">18</a>]. On the other hand, Manning (2010) points to a clear distinction between the concept
                                 of accountability, which is to be encouraged, and that of transparency which, because
                                 of the nature of policing and the need for secrecy and discretion, may not be an attribute
                                 to recommend to policing organisations [<a href="#R25">25</a>]. However, these criteria are challenging in post-conflict societies, where police
                                 institutions are often viewed with suspicion and mistrust and associated with insecurity,
                                 abusive behaviour, and corruption. Thus, relations and trust between the police and
                                 the community are typically extremely weak in these contexts. Given that these problems
                                 surface in many post-conflict contexts, Bayley [<a href="#R26">26</a>] raised the question of why there is no shared knowledge on how to tackle them. Instead,
                                 the focus has often been on building policing institutions to address ‘hard security’,
                                 such as combating insurgents. Such a preoccupation with combating insurgents often
                                 leads to a neglect of human rights and other democratic mechanisms. Unfortunately,
                                 there is no evidence that such approaches build trust between police and communities.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e384">In recent years, however, the international policing policy community has shifted
                                 its focus towards approaches which seek to work closely with communities to address
                                 problems of trust and accountability. One such approach is COP [<a href="#R27">27</a>]. Over the years, acceptance of this approach has gained ground within the UN and
                                 the EU and among different policymakers, police practitioners, educators, and NGO
                                 [<a href="#R17">17</a>, <a href="#R28">28</a>]. Some scholars have argued that—because of its principles of engagement, collaborative
                                 approach, responsiveness, problem-solving methods, and accountability—COP is a suitable
                                 model for re-establishing the broken links between police and communities [<a href="#R29">29</a>, <a href="#R30">30</a>, <a href="#R31">31</a>]. Others have been critical of this approach, calling it a Western model for policing
                                 strategies and even questioning its impact and effectiveness [<a href="#R32">32</a>, <a href="#R33">33</a>, <a href="#R34">34</a>]. Still other scholars have pointed to the shortcomings of COP, claiming that it
                                 collides with local customs and traditions of conflict resolution and justice mechanisms
                                 [<a href="#R35">35</a>]. The question therefore emerges, how can COP be successful in post-conflict societies?
                                 For this to happen, Brogden suggested the following: <i>…the key requirement must be that the initiative is local in character. It must draw
                                    on local experiences and practice in terms of what works. It should only borrow from
                                    the West when two conditions are satisfied. Those policing goods must come with an
                                    attested success record. Second, they must only be implemented when they are constructed
                                    through the benefit of local knowledge and sensitivity to local conditions and legitimation.
                                    Public ownership of policing, not state or police control is the key to communal policing
                                    in many transitional societies</i> [<a href="#R33">33</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e424">Brodgen argued that if COP is to be successful, those working towards reform must
                                 have the competence and capacity to understand complex local contexts and be able
                                 to facilitate the development of sustainable relations between the police and communities
                                 in ways that build trust and improve human security. This is true for police reforms
                                 led nationally in times of relative peace and for police reforms in post-conflict
                                 contexts, where the international community often plays a strong advisory role. The
                                 concept of sustainability, however, is not well understood, particularly in these
                                 difficult contexts. The World Bank report (2016) [<a href="#R36">36</a>] mentions this crucial point when it highlights the challenges and patience required
                                 to reform police and justice systems. The report outlines the importance of support
                                 from dedicated senior police officials, the need for patience when changing structures
                                 and routines that have long been in place and the need to nurture and follow up on
                                 the changes over a period of time. As the report emphasises, ‘Change requirements
                                 will need to be well understood, well sequenced, and given the time needed to mature.
                                 The more encompassing and fundamental the change, the longer it will take to become
                                 institutionalized’ (p. 8) The next chapter examines the concept of sustainability,
                                 specifically in the case of post-conflict police reform when the international community
                                 provides police advisory assistance, and explores the challenges faced by international
                                 police assistance to COP.

                              <p id="d1e432">A recurrent theme in post-conflict police assistance is the perennial challenge of
                                 sustainability: How can police assistance be effective after the donors have left
                                 the scene? A common complaint running through many case studies on post-conflict reform
                                 concerns the lack of sustainability, especially pertaining to local ownership. As
                                 a concept, sustainability rose to prominence in the 1980s with the publishing of the
                                 World Commission Report on Environment and Development (popularly called the Brundtland
                                 Report). The report defines sustainability as follows: ‘Sustainable development is
                                 development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of
                                 future generations to meet their own needs’ [<a href="#R37">37</a>]. Although the term was initially applied to environmental issues, it was later expanded
                                 to include social and economic issues [<a href="#R38">38</a>]. In order to preserve the earth’s ecosystem in an equitable manner, it is necessary
                                 to create community capacity that fosters effective participation and equitable treatment
                                 of all stakeholders while also maintaining an economic system that provides a decent
                                 standard of living for this and future generations. As Basiago concluded, ‘only by
                                 ‘‘integrating’’ and ‘‘interlinking’’ economic, social and environmental ‘‘sustainability’’
                                 can negative synergies be arrested, positive synergies fostered, and real development
                                 encouraged’ [<a href="#R39">39</a>]. Although the term ‘sustainability’ continues to be primarily associated with the
                                 developmental and environmental sciences, its core content can be usefully applied
                                 to human security and police reform. The concept addresses key issues of empowerment,
                                 participation, accessibility, and institutional stability—all of which are important
                                 components of post-conflict police reform.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e443">In its simplest form, sustainability in the context of police reform assistance ‘evaluates
                                 the ability of the police service to sustain itself and its capabilities without international
                                 donor support and guidance [<a href="#R40">40</a>]. Building sustainable peace requires an improved police service that has a lasting
                                 positive impact on the security and safety of communities by enabling threats, such
                                 as everyday crime and terrorism, to be capably and efficiently dealt with after the
                                 international actors have left the scene. There is no denying the fact that carrying
                                 out police reform/assistance in fragile states is a daunting task, especially given
                                 that police-community relations tend to be weak when such states have undergone or
                                 are undergoing crises. As Narotzky and Besnier stated, ‘Crisis refers to structural
                                 processes generally understood to be beyond the control of people but simultaneously
                                 expressing people’s breach of confidence in the elements that provided relative systemic
                                 stability and reasonable expectations for the future [<a href="#R41">41</a>]. Facilitating reforms against the backdrop of such political, financial, social,
                                 and logistical challenges requires patience and a continuity of effort. The responsiveness
                                 and participation of all local actors is of crucial importance and a critical prerequisite
                                 for achieving a long-term effect on police-community relations and building a capable,
                                 effective, and trust-based institution. Without local involvement and support from
                                 all stakeholders, police reform initiatives will have little chance of succeeding.
                                 Likewise, an understanding of local context is central, but not always emphasised
                                 in police reform processes. Understanding the specific circumstances of insecurity
                                 for different people and how it affects their lives goes a long way in being able
                                 to contribute to and protect their well-being. Police reform focusing on COP has the
                                 potential to address these areas in ways that conventional police reforms have failed.

                                    <p id="d1e454">There has been continuous debate, both at the policy level and at the operational
                                       level, about what exactly ‘local ownership’ means for donors and recipients. As Donais
                                       summarised, ‘… local ownership remains a contested concept in both theory and practice’
                                       [<a href="#R12">12</a>]. Participants in the debate tend to position themselves along a minimalist-maximalist
                                       axis. For the minimalist, ‘locals’ are national-level political elites, who are presumed
                                       to possess both the capacity to implement reforms (with outside support) and the legitimacy
                                       required to ensure broad public support for reforms. The maximalists, in contrast,
                                       argue that locals should integrate a wider support base, particularly domestic civil
                                       society, as a key set of local owners [<a href="#R12">12</a>]. Eric Scheye outlined four levels of ownership: national government and elite, local
                                       government and elite, justice and security service providers, and customers of the
                                       goods delivered [<a href="#R42">42</a>]. Although this outline seems simple and straightforward, this is not in fact the
                                       case, as all four levels face their own challenges. As mentioned above, reform is
                                       carried out in societies undergoing a transition from crisis to normalcy, and, in
                                       many cases, the state may be too weak to respond to immediate security and reconstruction
                                       challenges without outside help. In some states, government stakeholders may have
                                       their own vested interests in establishing a power base and authority for themselves
                                       rather than attending to the needs of the population. According to Donais, ‘In many
                                       cases, political elites may be neither representative nor enjoy widespread legitimacy,
                                       with the resulting gap between government ownership and national ownership producing
                                       only a thin veneer of reform that fails to penetrate into society at large, …in other
                                       words, while local political elites may be the most obvious local owners, they can
                                       also be the most problematic’ [<a href="#R12">12</a>]. Mani pointed to three types of local spoilers that can disrupt progress towards
                                       sustainability: political actors in the form of corrupt ministries; economic actors
                                       that wish to protect their activities (e.g., criminal groups); and institutional actors
                                       that are afraid of losing their sphere of power, authority, and influence in the new
                                       scheme of things (e.g., the military) [<a href="#R43">43</a>].

                                    <p id="d1e471">Criticism has also been levelled at ‘local ownership’ from a donor perspective.
                                       As Rathmell [<a href="#R44">44</a>] critically highlighted in the case of Iraq, training courses, plans, concepts, policies,
                                       and procedures came from abroad or the International Zone and were translated into
                                       Arabic and given to Iraqi counterparts in the false name of local ownership, using
                                       phrases such as ‘…what the Iraqis need is…’, ‘putting an Iraqi face on …’, and ‘obtaining
                                       Iraqi buy-in…’ [<a href="#R43">43</a>]. In a similar fashion, with reference to the Kosovo mission, Erik Scheye [<a href="#R42">42</a>] described how UN officials claimed that they had ‘consulted’ their Kosovo counterparts
                                       on police reform in the country. However, the story from the Kosovan side was that
                                       ‘…the UN consultation process was a polite form of external imposition and therefore
                                       they believed that they had little to no ownership of Kosovo’s JSSR programme’ [<a href="#R42">42</a>]. Some researchers have pointed to a Western-centric approach to police reform, in
                                       which the focus is on Western-style reform and policing models [<a href="#R33">33</a>]. Bayley argued that international police reform focuses on issues that are beneficial
                                       for donor countries rather than recipient countries [<a href="#R6">6</a>].
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e492">A critical question that emerges from the above discussion of police reform is how
                                       power and power relations can influence police reform efforts in post-conflict countries[<a href="#R12">12</a>, <a href="#R32">32</a>, <a href="#R33">33</a>, <a href="#R45">45</a>]. As Divon reminded us, ‘power is a constant feature in these relational mechanisms
                                       and manifests through the hierarchy presented in the exportation of models moving
                                       across through training, ‘‘knowledge’’, ‘‘experience’’ of ‘‘best practice’’ and success
                                       stories in the West’ [<a href="#R45">45</a>]. This unevenness of power relations was further addressed by Roderick Evans, who
                                       stated that ‘…more often than not it has been western experience and models inappropriate
                                       in developing country conditions that have informed these technical solutions… that
                                       are at odds with national and institutional culture. Enormous effort and resources
                                       can be wasted in creating institutions, structures and processes that are not ‘‘owned’’
                                       by counterparts, will not work in the local environment, are unaffordable and are
                                       therefore not sustainable in the long term’[<a href="#R46">46</a>]. As previously noted, post-conflict situations are complex and varied and involve
                                       a plethora of actors and shifting power relations, as international, national, and
                                       local actors and institutions compete to define and describe the realities on the
                                       ground. In this process, some institutions and interests become stronger while others
                                       become weaker. ‘Reforms of policing are about policing but also about power and politics
                                       and must be attuned to the political realities on the ground’ [<a href="#R47">47</a>].

                                    <p id="d1e519">An additional factor that can affect the sustainability of police reform is the degree
                                       of contextual knowledge about the ways in which a broad range of insecurities affect
                                       the lives of different people. Moving away from a narrow understanding of security
                                       as exclusively state security, the concept of human security considers various forms
                                       of interlinked insecurity (e.g., economic, food, health, environmental, personal,
                                       community, and political security) [<a href="#R48">48</a>]. The concept recognises violence and poverty as major threats that are related,
                                       although in ways that may not be immediately apparent, and—in its broadest sense—focuses
                                       on human vulnerability, encompassing threats of all kinds [<a href="#R49">49</a>]. Therefore, understanding the contextuality of insecurity is very important, as
                                       it allows for understanding how communities are affected by issues of risks, vulnerabilities,
                                       and protection and how capabilities and empowerment can serve to secure their lives
                                       [<a href="#R50">50</a>].

                                    <p id="d1e530">A lack of understanding of human security issues that affect the everyday lives of
                                       citizens and their local cultural norms, practices, and traditions—whether they are
                                       related to personal safety, domestic violence, or threats related to inheritance rights
                                       to land—hampers progress towards sustainable police reform. For example, UN Police
                                       (UNPOL) officers deployed in Timor-Leste had very limited knowledge about the local
                                       history, culture, language, and laws. This lack of knowledge became a problem, especially
                                       when officers had to interact with the local population [<a href="#R40">40</a>]. Having local knowledge gives reformers a firm foothold, enabling them to understand
                                       the realities on the ground related to security and insecurity issues, how they affect
                                       communities, how to address them, who should address them, and in what ways. As Marenin
                                       articulated, local knowledge allows for understanding ‘…which insecurities bother
                                       people the most, which aspects can be addressed most easily, what practices are most
                                       feasible, which will have the largest pay-off in the sequencing of reforms, or which
                                       leads to a better sequencing of reforms’ [<a href="#R10">10</a>]. However, being culturally sensitive to ‘local knowledge’ does not mean that one
                                       has to turn a blind eye to issues affecting basic human rights, such as domestic or
                                       gender-based violence or child abuse. Understanding the context of culture and tradition
                                       can enable one to develop policies and interventions that can bring about change.
                                       In the study of police-community relations, a human security approach provides ample
                                       scope for analysing the different actors and institutions that contribute to or threaten
                                       the security of citizens. A human security, people-centric approach emphasises that
                                       insecurities are not only multiple, but interrelated and therefore cannot be understood
                                       in isolation.

                                    <p id="d1e538">The question remains how we can better understand the complexities of sustainability
                                       in post-conflict settings and how the complexities can be addressed in a more integrated
                                       manner, accounting for the social/political context, the actors involved, and the
                                       possibility for local ownership. Marenin neatly summarised these considerations as
                                       follows: <i>Strategic lessons on how to approach reforms of policing can be grouped into these
                                          categories: understand the nature of policing; appreciate the generality and the specificity
                                          of local contexts; develop a strategic approach to the resilience of local histories
                                          and conditions; be aware of sequencing dynamics—needs and demands will change as reform
                                          becomes institutionalized; focus more on creating and sustaining a process of change
                                          and innovation and less on creating organizational structures; think long term as
                                          well as short term—international assistance will disappear by the priorities of donor
                                          not the needs of recipients; think circular and not linear; and learn from positive
                                          as well as negative experiences</i> [<a href="#R10">10</a>].

                                    <p id="d1e546">The issues of personal security and livelihood security are interconnected, and there
                                       is a need to bridge the gap between them in order to understand how local communities
                                       tackle their human security needs and how different institutions, such as the police,
                                       can contribute. The question of ownership or sustainability goes to the core question,
                                       How can trust between citizens and the police be fostered and increased in post-conflict
                                       societies, especially where the police may be the cause of insecurity? As previously
                                       noted, COP is often considered to be an appropriate model for resolving mistrust between
                                       citizens and police through its focus on principles for fostering community engagement,
                                       including ‘partnership, working together, responsiveness, service, accountability
                                       and transparency’ [<a href="#R51">51</a>]. But how are these principles operationalised on the ground? In Kosovo, UNDP carried
                                       out a public opinion survey to gather information about how the Kosovo Police Service
                                       (KPS) was perceived by citizens, especially in relation to preventing crime and providing
                                       security. This survey sought to assess the impact of human rights training that was
                                       mentored and monitored by the UN Civilian Police (UN CIVPOL) [<a href="#R3">3</a>, <a href="#R52">52</a>]. The survey concluded that ‘a majority of Kosovans now perceives the police as a
                                       trusted and credible institution’ and that the KPS ‘must further broaden public trust
                                       and engage communities through regular dialogue about steps to jointly improve current
                                       levels of safety and security’ [<a href="#R3">3</a>, <a href="#R53">53</a>].

                                       collaboration with various stakeholders, government and security officials, NGOs,
                                       and local representatives in several parts of the country—measured the perceived security
                                       concerns of people before and after the conflict in 1991-2001. According to the results,
                                       the key concerns regarding citizen insecurity included crime (especially violent street

                                       district had positive relations with the security forces [<a href="#R54">54</a>]. As one of the key security concerns of the local population was domestic violence
                                       and child abuse, family support units (FSU) were established to identify, train, and
                                       help police to prosecute offenders [<a href="#R54">54</a>].

                                    <p id="d1e571">Following the Good Friday Agreement in spring 1997 in Northern Ireland, an independent
                                       eight-person commission headed by Sir Christopher Pattern was established to recommend
                                       police reforms [<a href="#R55">55</a>]. The commission itself resembled a miniature PEN consisting of experts from the
                                       fields of policing, politics, law and civil management (the report chapter 2.1). The
                                       commission conducted meetings with civil groups within Northern Ireland (NI) covering
                                       all aspects of the civil society and relevant institutions abroad and conducted 40
                                       public town hall meetings over 10 months all over NI in addition to a number of other
                                       meetings with individuals and interest groups (Report Annex 2-3-4). The so-called
                                       Pattern Report, ‘A new Beginning: Policing in Northern Ireland’ listed 175 recommendations
                                       of how to change the militarised NI police into a community-oriented police service.

                                    <p id="d1e576">The above-mentioned surveys highlight the importance of creating a platform for interaction
                                       among all stakeholders concerned with police reform and human security, the ability
                                       of local populations to voice their concerns on issues of insecurities, and possible
                                       areas of improvement for police-community relations. Involving local actors is an
                                       important step in terms of learning about and addressing community needs and challenges.
                                       As such, a platform can be created for community empowerment and active participation
                                       in addressing issues of security/insecurity through finding local solutions.

                                    <p id="d1e581">The effects of conflicts can be devastating, and the forms of necessary resolution
                                       vary. For example, some post-conflict situations call for immediate conventional security
                                       assistance for a short period, while other situations involve processes of revival
                                       and rebuilding in a long-term timeframe. Even within the same society, some parts
                                       of society will experience relative peace, while others will face violent threats
                                       in the form of insurgencies, be exposed to armed conflicts, or experience a general
                                       lack of law and order. Therefore, post-conflict societies need a police service that
                                       can deal with immediate threats of insurgency as well as tackling day-to-day law and
                                       order issues within and between communities. Despite much progress, international
                                       police reform processes have not been able to reconcile these two aspects. Time and
                                       again, evaluations reports and research have pointed to challenges in the way in which
                                       police reform assistance has been provided, but have not acknowledged the types of
                                       assistance and support which are needed for long-term impact [<a href="#R4">4</a>, <a href="#R44">44</a>, <a href="#R56">56</a>].
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e592">The paradox in post-conflict contexts is that there is a strong inclination to view
                                       police reform primarily as an attempt to respond to immediate security situations
                                       that require quick-fix solutions. Long-term, comprehensive strategies for competence
                                       and capacity building consequently take a back seat. Rathmell et al. emphasised this
                                       trade-off in the case of Iraq, stating that ‘The effort to build structures that could
                                       serve Iraq well in its transition to democracy was in constant tension with the need
                                       to respond to immediate requirements. Inevitably, some of the responses to the immediate
                                       security situation, such as a reliance on tribal guards and the creation of a more
                                       centralized police command and control structure, were contrary to the coalition’s
                                       long-term political goals’ [<a href="#R23">23</a>]. In this regard, Bayley critically argued that most international police reform
                                       tends to focus on short-term rather than long-term goals, which concern planning,
                                       effective resource utilisation, and appropriate implementation [<a href="#R6">6</a>, <a href="#R26">26</a>]. As Rathmell et al. argued in the case of Iraq, ‘The matter of institution building,
                                       however, has been largely ignored by observers and policy makers; it is often seen
                                       as a long-term issue that is too far removed from immediate security needs’ [<a href="#R23">23</a>]. Bayley and Perito [<a href="#R9">9</a>] similarly highlighted a number of shortcomings of different missions, especially
                                       in Afghanistan and Iraq. Their criticism was directed at conflict management, the
                                       lack of proper plans for training the police, a lack of adequate evaluation reports
                                       on the impact and result of programmes, and ad hoc decision-making. This criticism
                                       was also a common complaint among Norwegian police officers stationed in Afghanistan
                                       [<a href="#R57">57</a>]. A recurring frustration expressed by Afghan police personnel to their Norwegian
                                       counterparts was their concern about ‘training vs. education’. ‘In their opinion training
                                       was seen as a short-term measure that addressed immediate tasks at hand, whereas education
                                       was seen as a long-term investment in the rebuilding of police institutions’ [<a href="#R57">57</a>].

                                    <p id="d1e616">Caroline Holmqvist posited that good democratic governance is of central importance
                                       to reform. According to Holmqvist, two important questions must be addressed: how
                                       to engage with the remnants of non-state actors and prevent them from destroying the
                                       peacebuilding process and how to help civil society to strengthen the governance of
                                       the security sector, both of which are long-term efforts in the reform context [<a href="#R58">58</a>, <a href="#R59">59</a>]. For Frank Harris, a clear distinction must be drawn between reform that seeks to
                                       make a police organisation more effective in terms of general policing objectives
                                       (e.g., crime reduction, tackling drug abuse, maintaining public order) and reform
                                       that seeks to make a police organisation more democratic. In his opinion, there is
                                       ‘considerable consensus amongst reformists about what the police ‘‘do’’, but far less
                                       agreement about ‘‘how’’ the police should do their work’ [<a href="#R60">60</a>]. However, as Ziegler and Nield [<a href="#R8">8</a>] noted, the two perspectives on police reform, the short-term and long-term approaches,
                                       need not be at loggerheads, because carrying out proper crime control and maintaining
                                       public order require a police service that is democratic, respects human rights, and
                                       abides by the rule of law.

                                    <p id="d1e633">Police assistance in post-conflict contexts involves different actors—both national
                                       and international—representing different policing cultures and traditions. As a result,
                                       there is often a lack of proper coordination and collaboration between organisations,
                                       giving rise to significant overlapping, confusion, and incoherence in police assistance.
                                       This lack of coherence and coordination on an international stage, where power in
                                       reform is held externally, was described by Ashraf in the case of Iraq. He described
                                       how ‘The Western politically inspired rush to complete the job in Iraq created a doctrinal
                                       tension between the active law enforcement approach of the UK military and the community
                                       based consensual approach of the UK police, which reflected the fundamental difference
                                       in objectives (and therefore approaches) of the two security services’ [<a href="#R61">61</a>]. A similar concern was also voiced by Norwegian police officers serving in Afghanistan,
                                       one of whom remarked, ‘everyone wants coordination, but no one want to be coordinated’.
                                       Germany was originally assigned the role of ‘lead nation’ in Afghan police reform
                                       due to its history of providing support to education, training, and the development
                                       of a civilian police force in the 1960s and 1970s [<a href="#R24">24</a>]. Critics, however, have charged that the coordination on Germany’s part was slow,
                                       haphazard, and confusing, which resulted in different nations essentially carrying
                                       out their own projects without proper collaboration [<a href="#R57">57</a>]. The result was multilateral organisations, regional organisations, bilateral organisations,
                                       International Governmental Organisations (IGOs), NGOs, and other organisations with
                                       different agendas and power bases participating actively at different levels and in
                                       different parts of the Afghan community.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e644">A further example from Timor-Leste demonstrates a lack of coordination and harmonisation
                                       among donor countries. In Timor-Leste, UNPOL was responsible for assisting and training
                                       the Timorese police. However, as Bajraktari et al. detailed, ‘These trainings were
                                       led by UNPOL ‘‘project experts.’’ However, without a standardized UNPOL training model,
                                       UNPOL officers offer various training models depending on their own national background
                                       and police training. This lack of uniformity creates confusion among the PNTL’ [<a href="#R40">40</a>]. A similar complaint was registered in Kosovo, where police training was conducted
                                       by instructors from diverse policing cultures, who provided different police training
                                       to the local police. In short, there is significant variation in how community policing
                                       is interpreted by different actors, which can cause confusion and misunderstanding;
                                       these challenges can become magnified when refracted through the structure of power-relations
                                       between donors and recipients.

                                    <p id="d1e652">One of the recurring dilemmas facing police reform missions is the dichotomy between
                                       quantitative capacity assistance and qualitative reform; reforms are commonly criticised
                                       for overemphasising the former at the expense of the latter. In considering the objectives
                                       and strategies of various police missions, the importance of quantitative assistance
                                       (such as increasing recruitment numbers, the number of people trained, and the quality
                                       of the technical assistance provided) is clear. While there is no denying the importance
                                       of quantitative assistance, Bayley [<a href="#R26">26</a>] affirmed that mere technological investment is no guarantee of a responsive and
                                       effective police service. In his words, ‘although it is easier to increase the technical
                                       capacity of police than to change their behaviour, doing so makes little, if any,
                                       contribution to democratic policing. It turns out that what is easiest to change—namely
                                       technical capacity—is the least important; what is hardest to change—namely, institutional
                                       behaviour—is the most important’ [<a href="#R26">26</a>].
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e660">Another common argument that arises in post-conflict missions concerns recruitment.
                                       How can the ‘right’ people be recruited in the ‘right’ numbers, especially in post-conflict
                                       societies where the state is weak, and unable to respond to security and reconstruction
                                       challenges without external help? This question articulates the need for a focus on
                                       ‘quality’ in reform. Local police may be more concerned with establishing their own
                                       power base among local elites than engaging with local communities, vulnerable groups,
                                       and minorities and protecting them from violence. Moss pointed to this dilemma in
                                       his article about the recruitment of Iraqi police officers after the American invasion,
                                       quoting Stephen White—a retired British police officer—who remarked that ‘local political
                                       leaders appointed police chiefs who in turn hired their friends, relatives and tribesman’
                                       [<a href="#R62">62</a>]. This phenomenon is linked to another recruitment challenge: the difficulty of representation
                                       in societies that are ethnically, religiously, tribally, and linguistically diverse.
                                       For COP to be effective and successful, the police service must both resemble and
                                       represent diverse communities, which can promote legitimacy and build trust, while
                                       simultaneously possessing skills in communication and negotiation. In an effort to
                                       address this goal, some scholars have also advocated for the use of merit media and
                                       affirmative action in police recruitment processes [<a href="#R40">40</a>, <a href="#R63">63</a>].

                                    <p id="d1e674">A key component in police assistance to post-conflict areas is training local police
                                       in fighting crime, protecting individuals, and upholding law and order. Yet, according
                                       to Bailey and Perito [<a href="#R9">9</a>], many of these programs fail to properly address the needs of the recipients in
                                       their training regimen. ‘Too often, reforms are suggested or training offered that
                                       reflect what can be given rather than what is needed’ [<a href="#R9">9</a>]. Furthermore, these reforms tend to operate under a ‘one-size-fits-all’ mindset,
                                       neglecting the critical requirement that police assistance be grounded in the local
                                       realities of culture, traditions, and history to ensure successful implementation
                                       [<a href="#R64">64</a>, <a href="#R65">65</a>, <a href="#R66">66</a>]. Hansen [<a href="#R67">67</a>], in his work on the Horn of Africa, proposed a set of assumptions regarding the
                                       role of the state in security that are sometimes made regarding police reform towards
                                       COP. Many police reform advisors come from ‘Western-style’ societies where the state
                                       is in control of providing justice and security to the population. However, in many
                                       post-conflict areas, state-controlled security/justice is not the norm; in communities
                                       without central state presence or control, there are other mechanisms for providing
                                       security and justice. There may even be different structures in different parts of
                                       the same country. Indeed, ‘one size will not fit all.’ The importance of grounding
                                       police reform in the local context is global. In South Asia, for example, Nawab et
                                       al. [<a href="#R68">68</a>] referred to the importance of understanding the legitimacy of local institutions—such
                                       as <i>jirga</i> in Khyber Pakhthunkwa, Pakistan—when trying to build trust between communities and
                                       the police. Similarly, Nyborg et al. [<a href="#R69">69</a>] cited the importance of learning how local institutions themselves have reached
                                       out to the police to work towards improvements in the community’s human security,
                                       even prior to the introduction of a formal COP reform process. This awareness of local
                                       context is crucial in the development of general curricula for trainers if they are
                                       expected to make any long-term impact.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e704">Still, even if trainers are grounded in the local context and equipped with a quality
                                       curriculum, Peake and Bailey [<a href="#R26">26</a>, <a href="#R70">70</a>] concluded that the knowledge and experience of practitioners is not being properly
                                       utilised at home and abroad. According to Bayley, ‘the people that do assistance work,
                                       both at home and abroad, know a great deal about what works and what does’t, but this
                                       knowledge is not being captured’ [<a href="#R26">26</a>]. A related challenge is the lack of continuity in training; ‘how to retain and pass
                                       on institutional memory remains a real issue’ [<a href="#R54">54</a>]. Beyond these questions of ‘how’ are questions of ‘who’ should provide training.
                                       Many training programmes enlist police officers sent by donor countries who lack adequate
                                       competence in the training of local personnel and are unable to deal with local realities
                                       [<a href="#R14">14</a>, <a href="#R71">71</a>]. Furthermore, it is often the case that ‘the people recruited to train local police
                                       abroad are themselves untrained in curriculum design or pedagogy…’Training and mentoring
                                       require special skills and the ability to adapt them to different environments. Successful
                                       training abroad begins with better training at home’ [<a href="#R9">9</a>].
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e728">Police reform and assistance is positioned in an intricate landscape with significant
                                       variation between different contexts. The complex and diverse issues surrounding human
                                       security in post-conflict areas require adequate knowledge grounded in local understanding
                                       to answer the questions of how and by whom these challenges can be addressed. Still,
                                       the pursuit of such knowledge creates its own set of considerations, challenges, and
                                       questions (including how training should be carried out and by whom) that must be
                                       considered to ensure local buy-in and sustainability.

                              <p id="d1e733">As previously noted in this article, police reform in a post-conflict society is a
                                 long-term commitment and task. Given the nearly 12,000 police officers who are at
                                 any given time engaged as police peacekeepers/advisers worldwide [<a href="#R72">72</a>], the risk of losing valuable knowledge and experience due to constant personnel
                                 turnover is clear. As the vast majority of these 12,000 officers are on a 12-month
                                 maximum deployment from their respective police organisations, there is a high risk
                                 of loss of corporate memory. As Bayley (2001) contended, there is a need to share
                                 knowledge on how to understand and tackle the lack of trust between police and communities
                                 in post-conflict situations. There is also a need to understand local contexts, including
                                 historically, to understand how police reform in each case can best be facilitated.
                                 One way to contribute to better sharing and use of knowledge on community-based police
                                 reform is through a dedicated network of policing experts. Although many policing
                                 networks exist internationally (even some with a focus on COP), they tend to be networks
                                 comprised exclusively of police. Due to the complexity of community-police relations
                                 in these difficult contexts, there is value in expanding such networks to include
                                 a broader base of expertise by integrating members of civil society and researchers.
                                 In the following sections, we introduce the case of the PEN established under a European
                                 Commission-funded research project and share the experiences and lessons learned from
                                 this unique group of people. We argue that such a network has great potential to contribute
                                 to the quality of police assistance and to a better understanding of how to facilitate
                                 bottom-up reform processes in post-conflict contexts.

                                    <p id="d1e741">The idea of establishing a PEN was launched as an integral part of the five-year,
                                       EU-Horizon-2020-funded research project ‘Community-Based Policing and Post-Conflict
                                       Police Reform’ (ICT4COP). The focus of the project was to explore the potential of
                                       COP to build trust between the police and communities in post-conflict contexts. The
                                       aim of establishing a network of police experts in the research project was threefold:
                                       to harvest knowledge, experience, and expertise from police practitioners, researchers,
                                       and civil society actors with field experience in post-conflict police reform; to
                                       engage in knowledge creation between practitioners and researchers on community-based
                                       policing practice and experiences in different contexts; and to create a broad knowledge
                                       dissemination network. A core consortium partner, the Norwegian Police University
                                       College (PHS), coordinated the PEN. As coordinator, the PHS was responsible for identifying
                                       and recruiting relevant police experts, including international police advisors, national
                                       police experts from the case countries being studied, local and international civilian
                                       experts, academics, and members of civil society groups including NGOs.

                                    <p id="d1e743">Membership in the ICT4COP PEN is voluntary and represents an individual commitment,
                                       under which members are expected to represent their own knowledge and professionalism,
                                       not their institutions [<a href="#R73">73</a>]. At the same time, members are free and highly encouraged to make use of the knowledge
                                       gained through the network in their institutions and professional networks. Network
                                       members are recruited based on their experience in international or national police
                                       reform and knowledge of community-based policing in post-conflict contexts, as well
                                       as their unique knowledge of the local context. As an integral part of the ICT4COP
                                       research team, the PEN meets together with researchers annually to discuss emerging
                                       findings and offer insights and advice on how to understand and contribute to positive
                                       change in the policing world; they are also in contact between meetings when needed.
                                       While the original PEN was an entity formed to interact with the project researchers
                                       for this particular project, the project researchers are also members of the PEN,
                                       making the PEN a truly shared forum.

                                    <p id="d1e753">The PEN is comprised of about 60 police experts (1/3 were female) from 20 countries.
                                       Apart from international police experts, the network also includes national police
                                       members from Bosnia, Kosovo, Serbia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Kenya, and South Sudan.
                                       The PEN members have prior experience in policing and civil society at the national
                                       level, international police advising, and research and training in post-conflict contexts.
                                       Two-thirds of ICT4COP PEN members are currently serving or have previously served
                                       as police officers. The majority of PEN members have experience as ‘police advisors’
                                       in different international police reform missions, and many without previous international
                                       experiences have experience in being advised by international police experts. Other
                                       members have previous experience with working on police reform as civil society actors
                                       and academics. The combined knowledge of the PEN members covers multilateral and bilateral
                                       police reform missions over the last 20 years and more. All of the major police reform
                                       missions since Bosnia in the late 1990s are represented within the PEN: Kosovo, East
                                       Timor, South Sudan, DRC (Congo), Colombia, Afghanistan, and Ukraine, among others.
                                       Several of the PEN members also have experience as police advisors to high-ranked
                                       strategic police leaders or political leaders in host countries, Inspectors General,
                                       or ministries of interior. Also of great value for the PEN as a group is the individual
                                       network that each PEN member possesses, which can be utilised by other individuals.
                                       For example, a former advisor to a Minister or an Inspector General will maintain
                                       a large network of contacts within that organisation years after her/his end of mission.
                                       The project researchers represent an additional 37 members of the PEN, making the
                                       total number of members and project researchers approximately 100 individuals. The
                                       researchers represent a variety of disciplines, including anthropology, criminology,
                                       political science, international relations, development studies, and information and
                                       communication technologies, with experience in and beyond the 11 case study countries

                                    <p id="d1e758">The PEN members and project researchers meet at annual project meetings, specific
                                       topic workshops, and other meetings throughout the year. In these forums, they exchange
                                       knowledge and shared experiences on international police advising, police reform,
                                       civil society-police interactions, and police and community awareness and training.
                                       At the project kick-off meeting, for example, PEN members presented their experiences
                                       in COP through a series of presentations, exemplifying the diversity in both the way
                                       in which COP is understood as well as the challenges implementation poses in different
                                       contexts. These presentations led to fruitful discussion of the premises and the direction
                                       of the research. They also allowed the researchers to learn in which regions the practitioners
                                       had experience and their areas of expertise. At annual meetings for the project, PEN
                                       members are always invited to give presentations from different police reform projects
                                       and share experiences. At the 2016 annual project meeting which took place in Niepolomice,
                                       Poland, several PEN members gave presentations of their ‘from-the-field’ experiences
                                       from different police reform processes. There, researchers and police practitioners
                                       had a forum for experience and knowledge sharing and discussions on police reform
                                       processes in Northern Ireland, East Timor, Kenya, and Ukraine. The discussions at
                                       times illustrated how different contexts resulted in different ways to practice COP.
                                       Other examples exhibited areas of similar practice. For example, there was a presentation
                                       on the case of Northern Ireland, during which a police officer involved in that process
                                       shared how the police force in Northern Ireland was reorganised into a civilian police
                                       service based on the 175 recommendations from ‘The report of the independent commission
                                       on policing for Northern Ireland’, more commonly known as ‘The Pattern Report’ [<a href="#R55">55</a>]. The PEN member explained how the establishment of ‘Police Boards’ and ‘District
                                       Policing Partnership Boards’ served as a means to re-establish trust between police
                                       and the communities and fostered dialogue, accountability, and local ownership. The
                                       establishment of local police boards in Northern Ireland was similar to the establishment
                                       of ‘Local Security Committees’ in Kosovo, despite their differing contexts, which
                                       led to fruitful discussions on how the groups functioned in each context.

                                    <p id="d1e763">It is also important to share instances of failed efforts in police reforms. In one
                                       annual ICT4COP meeting, a PEN member presented his findings and experience related
                                       to the first attempt to reform the East Timor police after independence. In his presentation,
                                       ‘Security sector reconstruction in a post-conflict country: Lessons from Timor-Leste’,
                                       the member revealed the shortcuts taken by a UN mission to hurriedly establish a new
                                       police force by re-installing some 400 former leading officers from the previous Indonesian
                                       Police Force (POLRI) after one month of intensive training. The population both before
                                       and after independence mistrusted these former POLRI officers and regarded the new
                                       police force as suppressors and strangers. In addition, the selection of non-POLRI
                                       candidates relied solely on a questionnaire in English developed by Western international
                                       advisors, favouring English-speaking candidates over those with knowledge of local
                                       dialects and culture. The lack of local involvement in the reform process led to alienation
                                       and mistrust in the newly established police communities, and the rebuilding process
                                       collapsed in the 2006 riots [<a href="#R75">75</a>]. The sharing of such experiences helped the members to understand the potential
                                       challenges they might face as advisors and provided a forum for discussing how to
                                       deal with issues such as historical context and power relations.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e768">In addition to the sharing of experience, PEN members also provide knowledge of political,
                                       organisational, and professional aspects of the international and national policing
                                       systems. This could include knowledge on the policies central to their work and the
                                       methods through which their work is planned and implemented, both internationally
                                       and nationally. Finally, the PEN also serves as a ‘local information help desk’ for
                                       the entire ICT4COP research team in the project’s case countries. Network members
                                       provide valuable pre-fieldwork information about who to contact, who can serve as
                                       ‘door openers’ to individuals in government and police organisations, and which practical
                                       arrangements must be made prior to conducting fieldwork. For example, researchers
                                       working in East Africa received help from European and African PEN members to identify
                                       and contact the proper individuals and institutions, including those in areas where
                                       COP concepts are implemented. Members of the PEN have also contributed valuable information
                                       on police training and education curricula from project case countries. A PEN member
                                       who had worked in police reform missions in Afghanistan, South Sudan, and Ukraine
                                       was able to share how the police reform mission in Ukraine adopted training models
                                       that were used in Afghanistan and Iraq with very little modifications due to a lack
                                       of understanding of local realities. This critical insight shed light on how a ‘one-size-fits-all’
                                       approach is still a significant challenge in many post-conflict police reform missions.
                                       This information was invaluable to the research project, as the policing world tends
                                       to be restrictive with the sharing of information. The researchers were also able
                                       to obtain documents, such as training manuals and curricula on COP, that are difficult
                                       for non-police to access and were offered valuable translation assistance for some
                                       of these training manuals.

                                       For example, Rozan, an Islamabad-based NGO, works on issues related to gender, violence
                                       against women and children, emotional and psychological health, and psychological
                                       and reproductive health of adolescents. In the annual meeting held in Oslo 2018, they
                                       presented their work in Swat on gender- and sexual based-violence against women. According
                                       to their experience, respondents initially did not disclose rape and sexual abuse
                                       on their own; it was only mentioned after trust was established between the organisation
                                       and respondents. As the topic is attached to a strong social stigma, it would be impossible
                                       for an outsider to gain insight and access.

                                    <p id="d1e772">A PEN member from Afghanistan with experiences from Tadbeer, a NGO based in Kabul,
                                       provided insight and knowledge around issues concerning human security, insecurity,
                                       trust building between police and communities, and developmental issues. Tadbeer had
                                       taken initiatives to institutionalise community policing at the ministerial level
                                       in Afghanistan. For this purpose, they wrote a community-policing consultation meetings
                                       manual. Concepts such as communication skills, problem solving, and conflict resolution
                                       were highlighted in the manual: terms that were new for both the police and the communities.
                                       This manual was ratified by the curriculum Board of Training Command Unit and has
                                       become a regular teaching material at the Police Training Command. Similarly, a PEN
                                       member from Serbia who works with the Belgrade Centre for Security Policy offered
                                       deep insights into human security, insecurity, democratic principles, policing regimes,
                                       and human rights in Serbia and the Balkans.

                                       result if the police or researchers worked in isolation. This collaboration has contributed
                                       to an in-depth understanding of how COP can contribute to human security in very different
                                       contexts. A new appreciation of the value of combining in-depth knowledge of policing
                                       experience, academic reflection, and practical work was developed, and trust was built
                                       in the PEN such that even the most difficult issues could be discussed in a constructive
                                       manner. Without such knowledge, it would be difficult to address issues of insecurity
                                       and security on the ground, including deciding who should address the issues and in

                                       engaged its members in a series of meetings and workshops. The topic was first discussed
                                       at a project annual meeting where police, civil society members and researchers worked
                                       in groups to discuss an initial outline of what such a course might include. This
                                       initial discussion was followed by a series of workshops over the period from 2018

                                       course content. The topic was subsequently discussed in detail in further meetings
                                       with researchers, who were then able to relate the emerging ideas to research results
                                       from several regions and offer insights into how context could be incorporated. During
                                       this process, practitioners and researchers in cooperation developed content and scripts
                                       and provided valuable comments on and inputs to the final pilot of the course before
                                       its release in November 2020. The target group for the course is international police
                                       advisors involved with SSR processes. However, the programme is designed in such way
                                       that it is relevant to and of value for civilian advisors, NGOs, host country individuals
                                       and organisations involved in SSR processes on a national, regional or local level.

                                       advisory positions of the value, strengths and challenges of COP. As evidenced by
                                       the UN’s curriculum development workshop in June 2019 (Strategic Guidance Framework
                                       presentation later this chapter), the demand for a common curriculum on COP is increasing.
                                       Through the development of these products, the ICT4COP project has responded to the
                                       need for training and education tools that reflect a broad approach to COP. Such an
                                       approach goes beyond an understanding of policing alone to understanding how policing
                                       is an integrated part of society and a reflection of historical, political, and cultural
                                       contexts.

                                       Policing. This e-handbook is an interdisciplinary qualitative field-based study combining
                                       practical experience from our post-conflict case countries, which can stimulate critical
                                       reflection and debate about potential opportunities, risks and dilemmas of police
                                       assistance and COP approaches and practices. The handbook covers a wide range of topics

                                       COP. The content development of the handbook was done through interactions where police,
                                       researchers and civil society members discussed and contributed valuable inputs on
                                       relevant aspects of international police assistance. By combining texts and digital

                                       way of communicating individual PEN members’ field experiences that can be used for
                                       educational and training purposes in understanding the complexities of and imparting
                                       knowledge about international police assistance. The process of developing curricula
                                       for international police advisors also addresses the desire for resources relevant
                                       for a broad international audience, but sensitive to local contexts and bottom-up
                                       approaches (a dilemma mentioned in Chapter 3 on the dangers of a ‘one-size-fits-all’
                                       approach). This is not an easy balance to achieve. For example, through the ‘Strategic
                                       Guidance Framework’ (SGF) program [<a href="#R77">77</a>], the UN has for years attempted to establish one common curriculum and one lesson
                                       plan for the training of international police advisors. In mid-2019, the UN Integrated
                                       Training Service established their own PEN of police officers with police reform mission
                                       experience, tasked to develop curricula and lesson plans for the 14 days long UN Police
                                       Officers Course (UNPOC) where Community oriented Policing is one among other subjects.
                                       The aim was to create one global common curriculum for the pre-deployment training
                                       of police officers assigned to UN police missions. All 193 UN member countries were
                                       invited to nominate individuals, and in June 2019 more than 70 serving police officers
                                       met in Brindisi, Italy for a kick-off workshop.

                                    <p id="d1e815">The participants were divided into different curricula development groups, each tasked
                                       to create training materials for specific topics. The group tasked with curriculum
                                       development for COP was comprised of seven police officers from Europe, Asia, Africa,
                                       South America, and Oceania. The idea behind this approach was to harvest experience
                                       from different missions and to secure inputs from different geographical and cultural
                                       corners of the world, eventually creating a UN curriculum that is neither specifically
                                       male nor female, and not particularly Western, African, or Asian. This process is
                                       an example of how other organisations can establish a PEN-like network to build on
                                       rich individual experiences. One difference between this process and that followed
                                       in the ICT4COP PEN is that the ICT4COP PEN also includes civil society actors and
                                       academics, which contributes to a much richer discussion of context and how it might
                                       be incorporated in training. The ICT4COP project call document specifically point

                                          <p id="d1e843">As we have seen above, there are a number of key actors and institutions involved
                                             in police reform and assistance. These actors and institutions are repositories of
                                             different knowledge and perspectives. Such knowledge heterogeneity represents a diversity
                                             of actors who understand and respond in different ways. There is a rich body of literature
                                             that critically examines the various aspects of knowledge regimes, which define, produce,
                                             and operationalise knowledge [<a href="#R79">79</a>]. In this paper, our intention is not to engage in a critical debate on the different
                                             dynamics surrounding the legitimacy and power of knowledge regimes, but to use the
                                             concept to think about the strength of the different actors and institutions involved
                                             with PENs. For this purpose Birgit Urstad’s [<a href="#R80">80</a>] seminal paper, ‘Keeping a Diverse Work-Force,’ opens up avenues for exploring the
                                             advantages of achieving diversity within organisations and institutions through the
                                             lens of knowledge regimes. Urstad was inspired by the work of Mary Follett [<a href="#R81">81</a>], who examined how institutions and organisations can benefit from the strength and
                                             nuances of diversity and thereby utilise the full potential of different knowledge
                                             arenas in a co-creative and innovative manner. In her paper, Urstad advanced the benefits
                                             of a diverse workforce in organisations and explored how actors possessing different
                                             competencies can contribute in a creative and meaningful way.

                                             organisational challenges. Following this perspective, we argue that PENs fit into
                                             the mould of knowledge regimes. The concept of knowledge regimes concerns how different
                                             actors, organisations, and institutions with specific knowledge, understandings, applications,
                                             and communication are guided by their own legitimacy, validity, and power.

                                          <p id="d1e864">However, as mentioned earlier, some of the challenges police reform missions face
                                             are asymmetrical power relations between donor and recipient, a lack of proper coordination
                                             and collaboration among the different actors involved in missions, a lack of proper
                                             understanding of local institutions; and challenges related to coherence and continuity.
                                             As Eriksen and Schober noted, ‘actors and stakeholders not only respond in different
                                             ways, but frequently understand the situation in which they find themselves differently
                                             as well’ [<a href="#R82">82</a>]. Police expert networks, with their interdisciplinary knowledge composition and

                                       during the project period. These communication activities were carried out locally
                                       in the different case countries with the stakeholders, project annual meetings and
                                       through the database were PEN members shared their information. As part of the project’s
                                       overall findings, four regional dissemination workshops were planned where all stakeholders
                                       could meet and discuss the findings, results, and exploitation plans. However, only
                                       two regional dissemination seminars and workshops were ultimately held [<a href="#R83">83</a>].

                                             from the ICT4COP project. Members have additional access to other networks, such as

                                             was to create a forum for communication and knowledge storage in order to enable PEN
                                             members and ICT4COP researchers to communicate and share information. The platform

                                             used it actively.

                                          <p id="d1e884">Learning from this experience, the project has created an online knowledge platform

                                             officials, police institutions, civil society and researchers. The aim of creating
                                             such a knowledge portal is to share research results, outcomes, findings and lessons
                                             learned in a way that is easily available to anyone involved in the field of COP or

                                             and operated by the University of Oslo. As with any digital platform, resources are
                                             needed to maintain and update content, which motivates members to log in and be active.

                                             for military staff for preventing crises-related sexual violence (CRSV), and in late
                                             2017 the PHS was invited to co-edit a chapter of the handbook for civilian police
                                             in peace operation missions. In order to assist the Ministry of Defence, selected
                                             members of the ICT4COP PEN network were recruited to assist with this CRSV handbook
                                             chapter. Over the course of only a few weeks, the editorial handbook committee was
                                             provided with inputs based on field experiences from former police advisors from Europe,
                                             America, and Africa, representing field mission experiences from Kosovo, Afghanistan,

                                             the handbook editorial committee at no cost, which demonstrates the advantage of a

                                             have had regular meetings (nationally) to discuss COP, share their needs and interests,

                                             reiterated that COP should be a comprehensive statutory obligation. Another senior

                                             Pakistan’s population is comprised of 67% of youth; therefore, it is important that

                                             and especially from the female police officers. The group made some very good suggestions,
                                             and the result was that the women police officers freely participated in the session,

                                             police accountability and trust. The importance of how PEN members with field experiences
                                             can assist in painting a more complete picture of how to develop local police accountability

                                             by examples from lack of police accountability and trust in a Kenyan slum. A PEN member
                                             presented examples of how the best international intentions of recruiting female police
                                             officers to Afghan National Police could result into a de facto recruitment to sexual
                                             abuse and harassment due to the lack of understanding of local culture and context
                                             by the international donors with good intentions. Another PEN member presented a UK
                                             programme on how to recruit volunteers to assist police in solving long-term security

                                             prevention training. Finally, the presentation of a research project from Norway dwelt

                                             Miami and San Salvador. The topic of discussion was the successes and shortcomings

                                             the increasing authoritarianism in the region’s politics and its expression of support
                                             of remilitarising policing strategies.

                                             interest in and raise awareness of different challenges and possibilities in COP and
                                             police assistance. First, the project has managed to establish cross-disciplinary
                                             networks in all case countries. By bringing together project researchers, local civilian
                                             societies, local police authorities, PEN members and local academia, these disseminations
                                             have paved the way for collaboration among local partners involved in strengthening
                                             COP activities. Second, the sessions have highlighted some commonalities across cases.
                                             This has enabled practitioners, civil society and researchers to exchange knowledge,
                                             practices and challenges among case countries. Third, by having representatives from
                                             the government and policymakers participate in these sessions, the network has been
                                             able to create channels to access and influence ministerial systems to see the advantages
                                             of community policing initiatives.

                                    <p id="d1e1013">The crux of the argument that we have been developing in the previous chapters is
                                       that carrying out police reform in post-conflict contexts is complex and challenging.
                                       Therefore, integrated knowledge and best practices are crucial for understanding the
                                       complex issues surrounding human security, police reform, and development at the local
                                       level. The community of women, men, and children at the local level who face security
                                       challenges are best positioned to understand and voice their concerns. Thus, access
                                       to local knowledge facilitates decision-making and empowers communities to take an
                                       active role in finding appropriate solutions to their challenges. Understanding the
                                       complexities of human security issues and identifying relevant actors and institutions
                                       at the local level can provide a solid platform for COP to be successful. It is in
                                       this context that we see the strength of PENs. As previously noted, through such networks,
                                       international police advisors with extensive experience in various post-conflict contexts
                                       team up with national police advisors who have deep knowledge about local conditions
                                       and challenges and are in a position to address local human security issues in an
                                       integrated manner. In addition, such networks also include civil society (local and
                                       international NGOs involved in ongoing projects where police are partners) and international
                                       and local researchers who have requisite knowledge and expertise from their respective
                                       case countries. Indeed, Bayley argued that ‘police reform cannot be left to police
                                       experts, but must involve area specialists, social scientists, and historians’ [<a href="#R26">26</a>].

                                       as a holistic endeavour. To do so, it is crucial that the actors involved in reform
                                       and assistance processes represent the key institutions addressing human security
                                       and development.

                                    <p id="d1e1023">As presented in Chapter 1, a significant challenge in police reform is the dilemma
                                       of coordination and collaboration. As we observed, donor countries assisting under
                                       multilateral organisations often work at cross-purposes without proper harmonisation,
                                       which in turn affects local ownership. Examples of reform missions in Kosovo, Afghanistan,
                                       Iraq, and Timor-Leste demonstrate how contributing nations essentially carry out their
                                       own projects without proper collaboration. For recipient countries, the result is
                                       confusion, as there is overlap between programmes and assistance from the international
                                       community. In addition, unequal power relations between donor and recipient countries
                                       influence most police reform efforts. A further significant impediment is the perennial
                                       challenge of local ownership. When donor-driven agendas prioritise short-term, easily
                                       quantifiable solutions instead of long-term processes based on local needs, long-lasting
                                       sustainable solutions are difficult to achieve. As previously argued in this paper,
                                       there is a gap in information and knowledge flow from the local level to the national
                                       level and between various institutions in post-conflict contexts. A key challenge
                                       is how to facilitate a better flow of knowledge from the bottom-up, especially when
                                       most communication is top-down. One ICT4COP PEN member mentioned the importance of
                                       understanding and working at the local level:

                                       <i>In relatively recent post-conflict contexts, particularly where conflict may be continuing,
                                          I propose there is compelling requirement for Police to develop their own legitimacy
                                          that is separate from the politics and corrupt interests of the state. This is critical
                                          for the police to be effective in its responsibility to protect the public but may
                                          be alien concept to the police and present significant risk to individual officers
                                          who may find themselves reassigned, unemployed or worse. Experienced PEN members and

                                          and may be able to suggest ways to support the police as an organisation and its officers

                                       PEN members worked in close cooperation, reveals the significant potential of a model
                                       which links key actors involved in security and development. Our annual meetings and
                                       dissemination seminars created spaces where PEN members could identify, address, and
                                       debate security and development issues on equal footing. The participatory and dialogic
                                       nature of these sessions gave ample scope for connecting security and livelihood concerns
                                       and finding appropriate solutions and strategies to address them. Working in this
                                       manner provides an effective base for securing sustainability and local ownership.
                                       For example, gender studies have provided valuable insights into how co-creative forums
                                       contribute to knowledge and innovation and help in improving societal and scientific

                                    <p id="d1e1041">Bailey and Perito [<a href="#R9">9</a>] argued that one of the major drawbacks in many police missions is the predominant
                                       focus on training a large number of police personnel without properly addressing the
                                       needs of the recipients. ‘Too often, reforms are suggested or training offered that
                                       reflects what can be given rather than what is needed [<a href="#R9">9</a>]. Donor countries come with their own understanding of police traditions, education,
                                       and training, thereby creating confusion, frustration, and disorientation in recipient
                                       countries. As affirmed several times in this paper, lack of coordination is a serious
                                       challenge in police reform missions. Moreover, human security issues in post-conflict
                                       situations cannot be solely addressed through the security lens, but must also integrate
                                       other actors. This is where we see the strength of PENs. For example, ICT4COP PEN
                                       members have provided valuable contributions on police training, education, and curricula
                                       from project case countries. Examples are COP trainings in Kosovo, Bosnia and Herzegovina,
                                       and Afghanistan. This information has been invaluable to researchers, as the policing
                                       world tends to be restrictive with the sharing of such information. Another example
                                       of partners working jointly is the development of an e-Handbook on COP. Work on the
                                       e-Handbook is the combined effort of PEN members who have the opportunity to discuss,
                                       criticise, and contribute content in the handbook. In addition, members also have
                                       the opportunity to delve into the complexities and challenges of COP in post-conflict
                                       contexts. Co-creative processes such as this are not easy, as there will always be
                                       disagreements on certain issues and perspectives. Nonetheless, there is a willingness
                                       to listen and discuss different perspectives within the group. Such meeting spaces
                                       provide the necessary impetus for bringing together the different actors involved
                                       in assistance and reform processes. It is in these sessions that the participants
                                       in the network can connect the various aspects of human security and development issues
                                       in a coordinated manner and discuss the implications in terms of how issues can be
                                       addressed and by whom.

                                       ‘In order to continue to provide relevant, targeted and efficient contributions to
                                       international peace and security, Norway should set up a knowledge management mechanism
                                       which gathers, systematizes and analyses experiences and lessons identified by police
                                       officers who have served in, or provided training towards, peace operations, stabilization
                                       missions and other assistance missions’ [<a href="#R90">90</a>]. In our view, a PEN can help in fostering and strengthening continuity and coherence
                                       and in preventing the loss of knowledge.

                                    <p id="d1e1057">The complex issues surrounding security and insecurity in post-conflict contexts require
                                       adequate knowledge to support human security at the local level. Such knowledge is
                                       critical in understanding issues pertaining to human security and how and by whom
                                       these issues should be addressed. As noted in the above discussion, local knowledge
                                       is of utmost importance. Equally important is the sharing of this knowledge. Previous
                                       research has affirmed that there is a lack of knowledge sharing and relevant feedback
                                       mechanisms in police reform efforts. For example, the e-Learning programme developed
                                       by the ICT4COP PEN is an important platform for knowledge sharing among participants
                                       and key institutions involved with Security Sector Reform (SSR). The development of
                                       the e-Learning programme is an excellent example of how the PEN both contributed to
                                       and shared knowledge. Other arenas of mutual knowledge sharing have been the annual
                                       meetings, locally organised workshops, seminars, and regional meetings. Through involving
                                       the group as whole, the network is in a unique position to influence the way COP is
                                       understood and practiced by those contributing to policy, training, and education
                                       in key European and international institutions/organisations/missions. The ICT4COP
                                       PEN members work in and have access to other networks, such as the UN, EU, OSCE, and
                                       DPKO. As such, the PEN does not replace or compete with, but rather connects with
                                       these institutions in a constructive and meaningful way. One PEN member deftly articulated
                                       this dynamic:

                                    <p id="d1e1072">The above discussion has identified some key advantages of a PEN which links security
                                       and development in an integrated manner. Aside from these advantages, we would also
                                       like to acknowledge the constraints and challenges of such a network.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e1074">Firstly, the volunteer nature of the ICT4COP PEN provides some unique advantages,
                                       as it creates an environment that is not beholden to any specific organisation; however,
                                       it can be difficult to maintain member interest and involvement, particularly after
                                       the conclusion of the research project if there is no coordinating body to ensure
                                       and sustain continuing commitment over time. Secondly, a key component of the ICT4COP
                                       research project has been the various arenas for dissemination, including annual conferences,
                                       regional workshops, seminars, and e-Learning projects. The challenge arises of how
                                       to carry out dissemination once the project period ends. Who will carry forward the
                                       experiences of the PEN (and how) to relevant institutions and future projects involved
                                       with police reform and assistance?.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e1076">Thirdly, as we have observed, ICT4COP PEN members have solid expertise and a rich
                                       background from different organisations and countries. As a result, the network has
                                       a unique pportunity to contribute, share, and exchange knowledge and experience across
                                       organisations and national borders. One of the criticisms of police assistance has
                                       been the difficulty of passing on knowledge. Albrect and Jackson contended that a
                                       serious challenge in police assistance and training is the aspect of continuity: ‘how
                                       to retain and pass on institutional memory remains a real issue’ [<a href="#R54">54</a>]. This challenge is very applicable to PENs. Therefore, the need to have a coordinating
                                       body is of utmost importance to utilise the integrated competence in a meaningful
                                       way.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e1081">Fourthly, the creation of the e-Learning module was an important contribution in knowledge
                                       dissemination. The learning module represents the combined insights of practitioners,
                                       civil society, and academia from actual post-conflict contexts, making it a solid
                                       platform for knowledge dissemination. However, things change and evolve; some knowledge
                                       and information will become obsolete and new information will become more relevant.
                                       Therefore, for the e-Learning module to remain relevant, it requires revision and
                                       updates at certain periods. This has been possible during the project period. The
                                       question remains how to carry out the update process after the project period is over.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e1083">Lastly, as with all time-bound projects, the creation of opportunities for collaboration
                                       is dependent on funding. Finding the right mixture of expertise, contributing in an
                                       integrated manner with both planning and making the right decisions and to be able
                                       to communicate with the concerned parties is dependent on adequate funding. As PENs
                                       are voluntary networks, it is difficult to ensure continuing commitment over time.
                                       Creating funding mechanisms is therefore vital for the survival of such groups.

                              <p id="d1e1088">Police reform and assistance is carried out in a very intricate landscape. As conflicts
                                 and their effects are not only disastrous, but also varied, post-conflict contexts
                                 differ from place to place. The complex issues surrounding security and insecurity
                                 in post-conflict contexts require adequate knowledge to support human security at
                                 the local level. Such knowledge is critical to understanding issues pertaining to
                                 human security and identifying how, who, and in what ways these issues should be addressed.
                                 Research and different mission evaluation reports have demonstrated serious shortcomings
                                 in the provision of police reform/assistance in post-conflict contexts. An important
                                 cornerstone in police reform is a reformed national police institution that is equipped
                                 to deal with crime and other threats, to create an awareness of safety and security,
                                 and to have a positive impact in communities. However, as we discussed in Chapter
                                 1 of this paper, situations in post-conflict contexts are often fluid and fragile,
                                 and police institutions may be weak and lack trust in communities. Research and prior
                                 experience have revealed how reform efforts often lack mechanisms for interacting
                                 with communities, learning more about their particular security needs, and finding
                                 ways to work together and address them. The best way of achieving these goals in diverse
                                 and volatile post-conflict environments occurs not only at the policy level, but also
                                 at the local level together with those whose lives are actually at stake. Without
                                 community involvement and support, police reform efforts have little chance to be
                                 successful. In order to achieve success, police must have the capability of building
                                 trust-based relations and networks with a diversity of societal groups.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e1090">Community-oriented policing is an important policing approach that provides a platform
                                 for building and restoring police-community relations. Its strength lies in collaborating
                                 with the community, creating accountability, and finding appropriate community-based
                                 solutions to local issues. A critical perspective that we raised in the article is
                                 the importance of grounding reform and assistance on local ownership. International
                                 police assistance is dominated by a top-down approach. External assistance and programmes
                                 are imposed on local actors without properly understanding local challenges, dilemmas,
                                 needs, and solutions. This approach can undermine local ownership of reform and assistance,
                                 leading communities to view such efforts as externally imposed programmes. As Scheye
                                 explained, ‘In a very fundamental way, therefore, both security sector reform and
                                 the broader debate over ownership revolve around the question of how international
                                 norms can be reconciled with local realities in ways that actually enhance the day-to-day
                                 security of those living within the reforming state’ [<a href="#R91">91</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e1095">This paper argues that PENs are unique knowledge networks that can address these
                                 challenges in an integrated manner. The main strength of PENs is the diversity of
                                 competencies present. Police practitioners, civil society, and academia have the opportunity
                                 to jointly work towards identifying, exploring, and solving crucial police reform
                                 and assistance issues in a comprehensive manner. The different arenas and collaboration
                                 opportunities activated during the ICT4COP project period have provided important
                                 platforms for co-creating a solid knowledge base that can provide valuable insights
                                 to all stakeholders. This process is very much in line with the EU focus on co-creative
                                 processes in their research and innovation programmes, emphasising the need for cross-disciplinary,
                                 cross-sectorial, cross-institutional, and cross-border collaboration [<a href="#R92">92</a>]. Furthermore, EU policies contend that dialogue and active cooperation between science
                                 and society help achieve socially responsible research and innovation processes that
                                 are also more relevant to citizens (European Union, 2014). European Union policies
                                 consequently advocate for co-creative approaches whereby researchers and societal
                                 stakeholders jointly develop new knowledge and solutions in various formats [<a href="#R92">92</a>]. We argue that PENs can also play an important role.

                              <p id="d1e1103">While a PEN will not be able to address all of the challenges faced by international
                                 or national police reform missions, we believe that such a network has the potential
                                 to be an important positive resource for improving police reform projects. The ‘HIPPO

                                 have some way to go to create strong channels of communication with local populations’.
                                 A group of PEN-members with participation from local police, previous peacekeepers,
                                 and representatives from local communities who can work together to improve the bottom-up
                                 focus of police assistance in post-conflict societies while furthering the best interests
                                 of the local population, without having to accommodate outside national and international
                                 political agendas [<a href="#R92">92</a>].

                              <p id="d1e1115">Police expert networks can serve as a discussion counterpart and advisory group for
                                 reform efforts. The aim of PENs is to support ongoing reforms or missions, not for
                                 PEN members to run or participate in police missions. Our idea is that a PEN can act
                                 as an additional bridge between donors’ wish for a ‘quick Fix and easy to document
                                 deliverable’ and the host societies’ wish for a ‘renewed, reliable, accountable and
                                 democratic’ future police service to be developed, performing in accordance with universal
                                 human rights standards. Ideally, the network membership will grow as police, civil
                                 society practitioners, and academics from countries undergoing reform join and share
                                 their challenges and experiences.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e1117">Development and reform of conflict-ridden societies has become a large ‘international
                                 industry’. It is both understandable and rational for actors involved in the development
                                 of a service such as the police to concentrate on tasks that produce swift and documentable
                                 results, which can be reported back to donors and personnel-providing organisations.
                                 For example, it is easier to report the numbers of host officers trained than of changes
                                 in policing skills and behaviour. As Rathmell stated, ‘The matter of institution building,
                                 however, has been largely ignored by observers and policy makers; it is often seen
                                 as a long-term issue that is too far removed from immediate security needs’ [<a href="#R23">23</a>]. A ‘knowledge base’ of information that can be utilised effectively in long-term
                                 bilateral and multilateral police reform and development is the ultimate goal of establishing
                                 a PEN. By becoming an established actor, a PEN will be in a position to counteract
                                 the trend of focusing on short-term goals by providing guidance and advice based on
                                 the PEN members’ combined personal experience and knowledge.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e1122">There are often different international, national, local, and personal interests at
                                 play during a reform process, and these interests are not necessarily aligned or in
                                 the best interest of the local population. Reform mission leaders or local community
                                 leaders may not agree with the advice provided by a PEN. Given their volunteer and
                                 individual nature, PEN can provide input based on broad knowledge and experience to
                                 facilitate an open and transparent debate on how to advise on local police assistance
                                 and development. Police expert networks operate as independent groups and do not promote
                                 any other agenda than the best possible outcome for the host community to develop
                                 their police service.

                              <p id="d1e1124">In many post-conflict societies and societies facing ongoing conflict, the police
                                 as an organisation often struggles to define its own legitimacy separate from politics
                                 and the corrupt interests of the state and/or its elite—a situation often unfamiliar
                                 to international police advisors. Experienced PEN members in these contexts will have
                                 an understanding of local dynamics and may be able to suggest ways to support the
                                 police to work towards independence from corrupt practices in order to strengthen
                                 the legitimacy of the police within the society and become more effective.
