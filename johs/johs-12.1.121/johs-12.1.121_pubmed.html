            <p id="d1e61">Author and Scholar Seug-Whan Choi’s ”New Explorations into International Relations:
               democracy, foreign investment, terrorism and conflict” serves as a nexus of interdisciplinary
               analysis and findings rooted in evidenced based research. Indeed, the author set out
               to challenge and test traditional international relations (IR) theories by implementing
               rigorous scientific methods in an attempt to produce policy recommendations and encourage
               a frameshift in methodological approaches. One underlying theme that recurs throughout
               this work is the requirement for rigorous statistical analysis and education in the
               field of political science. This has already begun and a re-emphasis is encouraged
               and greatly welcomed.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e63">More specifically, the author unpacks the often used term empirical analysis, highlights
               some shortcomings to this methodology and then offers solutions and stopgaps to mitigate
               potential pitfalls in future research. Surprisingly, there is still room to describe
               and offer original insight into the causes and effects of civil war and social unrest,
               terrorism, democracy and flows of investment. This interdisciplinary approach offers
               cross-cutting themes to be addressed and some revolutionary ideas based on evidence.
               Choi is able to systematically upend some very well established political science,
               economic and international relations conclusions that were based on empirical study
               through rigorous scientific and statistical methods; leading to new findings, sometimes
               the opposite to those found in the original works examined. At other times they open
               up new territories altogether.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e65">I think it is telling that the chapter on democratic and capitalist states and war
               and peace turns conventional conclusions of current security paradigms on their head.
               Furthermore, by challenging the paradigm of democratic institutions and policy outcomes,
               researchers and decision makers alike will be encouraged to apply rigorous methods
               to current and future policy, and most importantly the trial and error of replication
               study. From a methodological standpoint, this text helps show common pitfalls and
               relatively simple means to mitigate failure of accurate interpretation of multiple
               data sets of information. Choi also aptly raises the call for replication studies
               and null results reporting/scholarly papers, against the status quo, and encourages
               a permanent fixture of replication in scientific progress. A difficult feat, but greatly
               needed.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e67">And if statistical analysis and rigorous scientific research methods and interdisciplinary
               study offer no interest to the potential reader, Choi finally unpacks general patterns
               of political phenomena and their attributes. In particular, the discussion on outliers
               pays attention to an area often overlooked and its impact on general conclusions reached
               in empirical study. But don’t be put off by the many tables of data, statistical terminology
               and overall perceived headiness of this text. It is very tangible and would make ideal
               reading for the multidisciplinary undergraduate, graduate student, post doc and established
               academics alike - the need for rigorous, open and reproducible results in any discipline
               needs to be the mantra and battle cry of best practices and Choi makes a very good
               effort on this count.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e69">Later in the text when rule or law versus democratization are discussed, another example
               of how data can directly relate to foreign policy (evidence and non-evidenced based)
               are reviewed. Discussion of civil-military relations unpack some interesting data
               on how it may relate to terrorism and other factors.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e71">Some critique may also benefit this work. Specifically, in adding to, re-analyzing
               and manipulating data already reported and analyzed, ethical considerations should
               be clearly defined. In dealing with any data sets, human related or otherwise, it
               is easy to have 20/20 hindsight but difficult to carve ahead and be entirely unique
               or novel. Perhaps this work would also benefit from taking its own medicine and be
               reproduced in and of itself; to replicate a replication study. There will be harsh
               critique of some of the conclusions and findings featured in this study, but one theme
               cannot be attacked: statistical analysis and reproducible study are the only path
               to evidence based policy and must be the beacon of IR and political science study.
