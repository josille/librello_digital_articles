                  <p class="first" id="d1e58">This article proposes human security as an analytical framework to understand the
                     current trends of irregular migration (both forced and unauthorised) in East Asia
                     and revisits the seven pillars of human security defined in the 1994 Human Development
                     Report by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). It explains how the concepts
                     of human security are parallel to those prescribed in international human rights conventions
                     but different in terms of the attitude towards states. Human security does not directly
                     challenge state authority and adds a sense of urgency and moral authority that requires
                     extra-legal measures by the states. The author argues that human security is the securitisation
                     of human rights and is a better framework and policy discourse than human rights to
                     engage with state and non-state actors, especially in East Asia where political leaders
                     are more receptive to the former idea. The study draws examples from stateless Rohingyas,
                     undocumented sex workers in Thailand and Singapore, trafficked brides from Vietnam
                     and Cambodia, and smuggled North Korean refugees in China to demonstrate the nexus
                     between human security and irregular migration.

            <p id="d1e77">In spite of the increasing roles played by individuals and non-state actors, states
               still hold the primary responsibilities to protect and guarantee human security of
               citizens and residents within their territorial borders. The State is not just an
               <i>actor</i> that enacts and amends legislation on transnational migration between states and
               implements policy measures, but is also a <i>structure</i> under which domestic and international, private and public actors, interact with
               one another. Transnational migration is one such area where states are the gate-keepers
               of their own territorial boundaries and provide rules and regulations about immigration.
               Cross-border migration can be approached from different perspectives. While state
               sovereignty, territorial integrity, national security or criminal justice perspectives
               represent a conservative voice [<a href="#R01">1</a>, <a href="#R02">2</a>, <a href="#R03">3</a>, <a href="#R04">4</a>, <a href="#R05">5</a>, <a href="#R06">6</a>, <a href="#R07">7</a>], liberal and critical scholars focus more on individual freedom of movement, the
               global economic structure and migrants’ socio-economic conditions [<a href="#R08">8</a>, <a href="#R09">9</a>, <a href="#R10">10</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e117">This article offers a critical review of different schools of thoughts on migration
               and security from conservative, liberal and critical perspectives, which is followed
               by a critical assessment of the Copenhagen School’s securitisation theory. The main
               purpose of the review is to examine how academic discourses of international security
               have evolved over the years, especially after the end of the Cold War, from state-
               and defence-centric to more people-centred perspectives, merged with other discourses
               of human rights and sustainable development. After an overview of key debates on human
               security, it examines the 1994 UNDP definition of the seven pillars of human security
               as the most comprehensive and encompassing framework. It conceptually dismantles the
               seven pillars—namely personal, community, political, economic, food health and environmental
               securities—and shows how similar the contents of human rights and human security are.
               It concludes that human security is the securitisation of human rights that attaches
               a sense of urgency and paramount importance to affected people, regardless of their
               legal status, and that requires extra-legal and extra-political measures by the concerned
               states.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e119">The study draws on a number of recent examples from East Asia (both South and North)
               where migrants risk their lives to cross the borders through unauthorised land or
               sea routes in order to relocate themselves and their families to more secure places.
               They include North Korean ‘smuggled refugees’ [<a href="#R11">11</a>], undocumented Cambodian workers and trafficked fishermen in Thailand [<a href="#R12">12</a>], overstayed Bangladeshi workers in Japan [<a href="#R13">13</a>], stateless Rohingyas [<a href="#R14">14</a>], trafficked Vietnamese brides in Korea [<a href="#R15">15</a>] and Karen refugees in Thailand [<a href="#R16">16</a>], to name a few. Migrant’ decisions to move across their national boundaries are
               driven by their natural instinct for survival to go to a more secure place even when
               the movement is unauthorised by relevant state authorities. Irregular migration is
               a highly complex area of studies as most cases present mixed migration with multiple
               causes in a vicious circle. In other words, a migrant who wanted to escape from poverty
               and discrimination, pays for a smuggler to cross the border and ends up being a victim
               of human trafficking. Where s/he is rescued, s/he realises s/he could have claimed
               refugee status, so s/he does. Still, s/he has no right to work. Within the broad category
               of unauthorised movement, the boundaries and key definitions of irregular migration
               (which includes undocumented labour migration, human trafficking, people smuggling
               and asylum seeking) are all blurred and the process of irregular migration is highly
               unpredictable.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e140">While migrants are in such dire conditions, the current human rights framework is
               insufficient to solve the problem. According to Article 13(2) of the 1948 Universal
               Declaration of Human Rights, individuals have the right to leave a country of origin.
               However, international human rights law does not provide an express right for the
               individual to reside elsewhere nor place a duty upon other states to receive them.
               Mobility is therefore incompletely defined and protected under the existing human
               rights regime. It is the states that decide whom they want to receive as residents,
               temporary and permanent alike, and accept as citizens. State obligations to protect
               and respect basic human rights of those who are not their citizens have not been properly
               observed under international law. In this regard, human security may offer a powerful
               language and discourse for international and regional cooperation to tackle irregular
               migration. The term promotes the urgency and paramount importance attached to affected
               people regardless of their legal status, as well as to hosting societies. Human security
               highlights the on-going challenge posed by irregular migration that requires immediate
               measures by the concerned states that go beyond traditionally defined domestic rules
               and regulations on immigration or charitable humanitarian consideration. By redefining
               the seven pillars of human security in the context of irregular migration in East
               Asia, the study contributes to the clarity of mixed terminologies and multiple causes
               of irregular migration as well as to the growing body of knowledge and theoretical
               development for the existing literature on the nexus between human insecurity and
               irregular migration.

            <p id="d1e145">This section critically reviews three main theories of migration in relation to security.
               The real world of scholars and practitioners present a mixture of some of these basic
               ideas and the lines among the three schools are highly blurred (see Table <a href="#Tab1">1</a> below). Nevertheless, the purpose here is to provide the most distinctive lines of
               argument on this area. Philippe Bourdeau [<a href="#R01">1</a>] aptly introduces three models of securitisation of migration. The first and mainstream
               model is from the realist tradition of International Relations (IR). Robert Kaplan
               [<a href="#R17">17</a>] warned that Western states should fear the ‘coming anarchy’ associated with mass
               migration while Samuel Huntington [<a href="#R18">18</a>] declared that the persistent flow of Hispanic immigrants would constitute a major
               potential threat to America’s cultural and political identity. One of the most well-known
               conservative migration scholars is Myron Weiner [<a href="#R19">19</a>] who stated that ‘advanced industrial countries can protect their borders from invading
               armies but not from hordes of individuals who slip into harbours, crawl under barbed-wire
               fences and wade across rivers’. Weiner’s migration-security nexus [<a href="#R20">20</a>] draws what he calls the Security Stability Framework on how international migration
               creates conflict within and between countries from a realist perspective, which sees
               migration as a potential threat to national security. For realists, therefore, the
               expansion of international migration is dangerous for state sovereignty and the balance
               of power among states in the international system and would create violent conflicts
               among states [<a href="#R21">21</a>].
               
            </p>
            <p id="d1e169">For liberals, on the other hand, national borders should be open for free trade, labour
               mobility and individual liberty, although there are several different sub-groups within
               the liberal camp. For example, neoliberals would advocate for free trade, fewer regulations
               and unrestricted labour mobility while classical liberals focus on individual liberty,
               human rights and justice. Liberal scholars envisage the ‘client politics model’ [<a href="#R22">22</a>, <a href="#R23">23</a>, <a href="#R24">24</a>] or the ‘embedded liberalism model’ [<a href="#R25">25</a>, <a href="#R26">26</a>], both of which support freedom of movements. In this liberal perspective, international
               institutions and international laws are supposed to set rules and regulations that
               respect individual freedom and democracy, and that contribute to shaping more cooperative
               and open-minded state behaviour towards globalisation and international migration.
               Free(r) movements, however, on the contrary, have made many migrant workers’ conditions
               worse instead of helping them alleviate poverty, underdevelopment and corruption,
               an issue which the next group of scholars address.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e186">Critical theorists oppose both realist and liberal views, arguing that security is
               neither about survival nor about urgency and exceptional practices. Rather, security
               is the ‘result of mundane bureaucratic decisions of everyday politics that create
               a sense of insecurity, fear, danger and unease’ [<a href="#R27">27</a>, <a href="#R28">28</a>]. Didier Bigo identifies this as the ‘governmentality of unease’. According to him,
               the securitisation process is above all ‘routinised practices of professionals of
               security, essentially police and bureaucrats’. This relates to Ole Wæver’s securitisation
               theory to identify existential threats from imagined enemies and to highlight ‘speech
               act’. The speech acts are not only done by bureaucrats or security professionals but
               also by the conservative media, nationalist politicians or xenophobic individuals
               who post their opinions on the Internet and they spread over a few minutes across
               space. The state (or Bigo’s security professionals), in this sense, waits until normative
               equilibrium is reached in the society and belatedly reacts to social demands in democratic
               society. Threats may not exist, but fear does endogenously within individuals living
               in the system of mass migration. It is not just created by external sources of bureaucrats.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e194">The Copenhagen School, which is part of the critical theory and is led by Wæver, gives
               specific methodological insights into the securitisation of irregular migration. Barry
               Buzan’s Securitisation Theory (ST) [<a href="#R29">29</a>, <a href="#R30">30</a>] provides a framework to theorise how East Asian states are securitising irregular
               migration and to identify which security norms the states are constituting and utilising
               over the years. As Bourdeau [<a href="#R01">1</a>] says, ST is ‘the most widely applied and fully developed model of relationships
               between migration and security’ and a ‘most creative and productive analytical framework’.
               Securitisation is, by definition, the ‘process of integrating migration discursively
               and institutionally into security frameworks that emphasise policing and defence’
               [<a href="#R01">1</a>]. Like social constructivism [<a href="#R31">31</a>], one of the greatest strengths of ST is that it shifts the focus of analysis away
               from merely material factors to socio-cultural and normative ones.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e211">Wæver [<a href="#R32">32</a>] himself identifies his own ST as an analysis of ‘actual linguistic practices to
               see what regulates discourse’. The Copenhagen School examines what practitioners ‘do
               in talking security’. Wæver’s notion of security is that it is the ‘result of a move
               that takes politics beyond the established rules of the game and frames the issue
               as above normal politics’, which also applies to human security. However, his interpretation
               of the designation of existential threat is negative in a sense that it is only to
               justify the use of extraordinary measures or special powers such as enforcement and
               secrecy. His view of security is a ‘failure to deal with issues as normal politics’.
               For Wæver, therefore, de-securitisation is the optimal long-range solution, which
               limits the scope for interpretations of security to human dimensions.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e216">I would add a new human dimension to Waever’s ST. There have been changing conceptions
               of security from state-centric to people-centred. I would still place this new dimension
               under the post-structural critical school as my version of human security framework
               is going beyond both realist/liberal rational theory and instead focusing on non-linear
               circular processes of human insecurity and irregular migration. Previous work on the
               securitisation of migration focus on the negative notion of security as urgency, control
               and power [<a href="#R33">33</a>, <a href="#R23">23</a>]. Maggie Ibrahim [<a href="#R34">34</a>] for example, calls the securitisation of migration the ‘latest and most modern form
               of racism’. In fact, fear-mongering, criminal imagery of migrants, witch-hunting or
               ‘othering’ particular ethnic groups are old tactics of securitisation of migrants.
               However, this limited and negative state-centric perspective of securitisation does
               not capture the changed concepts of security in a more humane way and that includes
               considerations of the agency of migrants. The Rohingya boat people crisis in May 2015
               also presents multi-faceted human security issues of irregular migration concerning
               the poverty, conflict and discrimination that drive migrants into the illegal sea
               routes that are operated by traffickers.

            <p id="d1e284">There is another problem with ST that is the disconnection between theory and empirical
               evidence. As Bigo [<a href="#R28">28</a>, <a href="#R35">35</a>], the founding father of the Paris School, points out, actual policy practices often
               reveal patterns different from those found in official discourses. Many have tried
               to fill this gap. Bourdeau [<a href="#R01">1</a>] brings his own cases from Canada and France whereas Melissa G. Curley and Wong Siu-lun
               [<a href="#R36">36</a>] provide Northeast Asian case studies. Feminist security studies offer valuable observations
               and analyses on how different forms of migration are securitised or under-securitised
               [<a href="#R37">37</a>, <a href="#R38">38</a>, <a href="#R39">39</a>, <a href="#R40">40</a>, <a href="#R41">41</a>], which provided inspiration for the current study. Migrants’ self-organising behaviour
               and interactions among themselves and with the state migration regimes are key to
               understanding the evolutionary correlation between migration and security.

            <p id="d1e317">As explained above, the conventional notion of security focuses on national defence,
               military security or territorial integrity of sovereign states, virtually synonymous
               with ‘defence’ [<a href="#R42">42</a>, <a href="#R43">43</a>]. Notions of personal, cultural or environmental security emerged and the reconceptualisation
               of security has been carried out by IR theorists [<a href="#R44">44</a>, <a href="#R44">44</a>, <a href="#R45">45</a>, <a href="#R42">42</a>, <a href="#R46">46</a>, <a href="#R47">47</a>, <a href="#R48">48</a>, <a href="#R49">49</a>, <a href="#R50">50</a>, <a href="#R30">30</a>, <a href="#R51">51</a>]. The major breakthrough was the 1994 UNDP report. In the report, the UNDP laid out
               two broad categories of human security: ‘freedom from fear’ and ‘freedom from want’
               [<a href="#R52">52</a>, <a href="#R53">53</a>, <a href="#R54">54</a>]. It argued that ‘human security is not a concern with weapons—it is a concern with
               human life and dignity’, best insured through prevention and people-centeredness.
               It detailed seven components of human security: personal, community, political, economic,
               food, energy and environment securities that are interdependent with one another.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e369">Since then, human security has been revisited for further investigation for its utility
               and its relation to other global political concerns [<a href="#R43">43</a>, <a href="#R55">55</a>, <a href="#R56">56</a>, <a href="#R57">57</a>]. Some have a narrow definition of human security as ‘vulnerability to physical violence
               during conflict’ [<a href="#R58">58</a>] while others share a broader concept, linking it with other areas such as development
               or globalisation [<a href="#R59">59</a>, <a href="#R60">60</a>], which is often represented as the Canadian vs. Japanese conceptions of human security
               [<a href="#R61">61</a>]. Ernst Haas [<a href="#R62">62</a>] long argued that the security literature needs to learn from the ‘evolutionary epistemology’
               of global life. Similarly, Mark Duffield [<a href="#R63">63</a>] agrees that human security provides a means of distinguishing geopolitics, the security
               of states, from biopolitics, the security of population. For many in East Asia, economic,
               food, energy and environmental issues are real and immediate threats to their peoples’
               survival and resilience. Developing countries like Myanmar, Vietnam, Cambodia, the
               Philippines and Indonesia send many economic and marriage migrants overseas and migrants
               send remittance back to their countries of origin. North Korea has chronic food shortage
               [<a href="#R64">64</a>, <a href="#R65">65</a>, <a href="#R66">66</a>]. China, Japan and South Korea started planning to secure long-term food security,
               especially rice, and energy security, which both involve seasonal labour forces. Japan,
               Indonesia and the Philippines are vulnerable to natural disasters such as typhoons,
               whereas the Greater Mekong region faces man-made environmental degradation through
               mining and dam construction, activities that result in forced eviction at times.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e412">Each state’s historical (post-colonial), political and cultural backgrounds constitute
               its attitude to human <i>rights</i> vs. human <i>security</i>. Many in East Asia were under Western colonial rule (except for Korea which was under
               the Japanese rule) and have authoritarian political structures, which have been deeply
               embedded in hierarchical male-dominant role-based cultures or religions. Governments
               are under pressure for their lack of transparency and accountability, rising middle-classes
               or ethnic rivalry. In this environment, the political elites are more receptive toward
               the idea of collective (human) <i>security</i> while being resistant to individual human <i>rights</i>. A state as an actor also wants to survive as individual migrants do. The former
               prime ministers of Singapore and Malaysia, Lee Kuan Yew and Mahathir bin Mohamad,
               for example, defined human rights as Western concepts that were not suitable for many
               Asian countries. The former Singaporean foreign minister Kishore Mahbubani also argues
               that human rights are an ‘aggressive alien Western concept’ [<a href="#R67">67</a>]. The default assumption in human rights is that the state is the potential perpetrator
               either by committing human rights violations or by omitting its obligations to protect
               human rights. State-society relations are confrontational under the doctrine of human
               rights. In the language of human security, however, states remain the primary guarantors
               of human security or providers of goods and services for people’s well-being while
               being able to establish normal authority in international society by looking after
               its own people as well as vulnerable migrants. Having a closer examination of the
               contents of the seven pillars of human security endorsed by the UNDP in 1994 [<a href="#R52">52</a>], however, I would argue that they are all within the realm of international human
               rights as seen below Table <a href="#Tab2">2</a>.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e436">Whereas human rights challenge state authority and sovereignty and often accuse states
               of being potential perpetrators, human security expects state moral authority, expands
               state responsibilities to non-citizens, i.e. vulnerable migrants regardless of their
               legal status, and urges trans-political supra-national measures that go beyond existing
               national mechanisms. It is the urgency and the magnitude of impact on vulnerable irregular
               migrants that transcends state sovereignty and territorial integrity and that can
               affect hosting societies on a greater scale if no proper measures are taken in time.
               This requires immediate transnational cooperation. In this regard, a good state may
               want to seize the opportunity to take ownership of human security and play a responsible
               role for the regional security.

            <p id="d1e503">Unlike the misconceived idea of human rights as an imperial Western concept among
               many authoritarian leaders in East Asia, human security has the potential to grow
               more as a foreign policy concept. There are signs many East Asian elites are already
               receptive to the idea of human security. Amitav Acharya [<a href="#R68">68</a>] went even further, arguing that human security is originally an ‘Asian’ concept
               as Mahbub ul Haq, who is the main author of detailing the concepts of human security
               in the 1994 UNDP report, is an ‘Asian’ scholar. Japan has initiated the Asian approach
               to human security by embracing socio-economic aspects such as food and energy security
               in contrast to the Canadian emphasis on the ‘freedom from fear’ in armed conflict.
               The Japanese government saw human security comprehensively covering ‘all the menaces
               that threaten human survival, daily life and dignity—for example, environment degradation,
               violations of human rights, transnational organised crime, illicit drugs, refugees,
               poverty, anti-personal landmines and other infectious diseases such as AIDS’ [<a href="#R43">43</a>, <a href="#R69">69</a>]. Japan’s comprehensive security, therefore, bears both a traditional statist notion
               of closer military cooperation with the US and non-traditional economic, energy and
               food security [<a href="#R70">70</a>]. Although Acharya [<a href="#R68">68</a>] remains pessimistic in arguing that ASEAN countries’ main concern is regime survival
               and legitimation as in the case of Singapore’s ‘Total Defence’ [<a href="#R71">71</a>] rather than genuine concern for people’s well-being and security, the two are inseparable.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e524">Furthermore, some East Asian leaders embrace and mobilise human security in their
               public speeches [<a href="#R72">72</a>, <a href="#R73">73</a>, <a href="#R74">74</a>] (on the Asian conception of human security, see: [<a href="#R75">75</a>, <a href="#R76">76</a>]). In 2002, Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji and ASEAN leaders jointly declared on cooperation
               in the field of non-traditional security at the sixth China-ASEAN Summit in Phnom
               Penh, Cambodia. At the Symposium on ‘Realizing Human Security in Asia’ in Tokyo in
               2010, the Secretary-General of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and former
               Thai Foreign Minister, Surin Pitsuwan, endorsed the concept of human security as ‘a
               rather comprehensive concept…[that]…will not be in competition with the issue of state
               sovereignty. In fact, it is making the state’s sovereignty more meaningful because
               state security and state sovereignty, also would involve responsibility’ [<a href="#R77">77</a>]. Pitsuwan also connected the concept to social safety nets in the wake of the 1997
               Asian Financial Crisis. In the recent publication of the Armed Forces of the Philippines
               [<a href="#R78">78</a>] Internal Peace and Security Plan: Bayanihan, the whole-of-nation ‘human security’
               approaches were identified as the strategic planning for peace and security, natural
               disasters and other illicit activities such as human trafficking, piracy and people
               smuggling.

            <p id="d1e551">The final section of the article examines the nexus between human (in)security and
               irregular migration. Many have tried to bring in broader concepts of human security
               in migration studies, rather than traditional national and border security perspectives.
               Elspeth Guild and Joanne van Selm [<a href="#R79">79</a>] reconceptualise security as ‘political and legal security’, ‘cultural and identity
               security’ and ‘personal and economic security’ in their study on the impact of immigrants
               on hosting countries. Literature on the migration-development nexus [<a href="#R80">80</a>, <a href="#R81">81</a>], migration-development-security [<a href="#R82">82</a>], and migration-globalisation-human security [<a href="#R83">83</a>] employs people-centred security concepts. The nexus between human insecurity and
               irregular migration has been observed in the East Asian context. Dewi F. Anwar [<a href="#R84">84</a>] has tried to weave together the ideas of human rights, security and irregular migration.
               In particular, she identified new threats to human security as the exploitation of
               irregular workers, the growing incidence of people smuggling and human trafficking.
               However, Anwar did not concretise the contents of human security and used the term
               with ‘non-traditional’ security interchangeably, which made the concept very vague.
               With further embodiment and comparison with established international human rights
               norms, the UNDP’s human security lens can provide an alternative agent-based analysis
               for the motivations of migrants, the vulnerability they face as well as the potential
               or imagined threats they pose to hosting societies.
               
            </p>
            <p id="d1e572">Human (in)security has been the main driver for irregular migration. Because of their
               irregular status, migrants’ human security comes under greater threat (no matter where
               they end up), which feeds into the vicious cycle of insecurity-triggered migratory
               patterns. Unless this vicious circle is broken by urgent extra-legal measures by the
               concerned states, both vulnerable migrants and hosting societies can end up in highly
               insecure situations. In spite of the greater risk that irregular migration poses for
               all societies, the term ‘irregular migration’ has been associated with the illegality
               of people’s movements. It is labelled clandestine, illegal, <i>sans papier</i> (undocumented), uncontrolled, unlawful, unauthorised, alien without residence status,
               or non-compliant. In 1974, the United Nations made the first reference to irregular
               migration in connection with the treatment of ‘illegal aliens’ [<a href="#R85">85</a>]. In the following year, the UN General Assembly adopted Resolution 3449 (30) where
               it called on the UN system to use the term ‘non-documented’ or ‘irregular’ in official
               documents rather than ‘illegal’ migrants. The International Organization for Migration
               defines irregular migration as the ‘movement that takes place outside the regulatory
               norms of the sending, transit and receiving countries’. I would define irregular migration
               as emerging patterns of people’s mobility that does not conform to established rules,
               norms, customs or morality, which include unauthorised illegal migration as well as
               forced migration. Following Martin Ruhs and Bridget Anderson’s compliance approach
               [<a href="#R86">86</a>], ‘unauthorised’ here has two meanings: one is movement that has not abided by existing
               migration regulations in a given state and the other is that states do not have laws
               (yet) to regulate illicit migration. For this article, people ‘affected’ [<a href="#R87">87</a>] by irregular migration fall into four categories: 1) unregistered, overstayed or
               misusing-visa labour migrants; 2) asylum seekers, stateless people, or IDPs; 3) trafficked
               persons or 4) smuggled people. In reality, however, these four categories are blurred
               and cross-boundary: undocumented Cambodian fishermen become easy targets for traffickers
               [<a href="#R88">88</a>] and North Korean asylum seekers in China get ‘help’ from missionary smugglers to
               use the underground railway to cross the border to Southeast Asia [<a href="#R89">89</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e593">East Asia produces a large number of irregular migrants inter-regionally but also
               intra-regionally. Border controls are not rigidly enforced in certain places due to
               geographical challenges or the lack of government capacity. East Asia’s diverse and
               vibrant environments create intra-regional migration for labour, sex, marriage or
               freedom. East Asia has high degrees of demographic, political, economic, socio-cultural
               and ethnic diversity, which makes the cross-border movements more frequent and fluid
               as in diffusion and osmosis in physics. In China, it has the world’s biggest population
               of 1.38 billion and one of the smallest, Brunei with only 412,000 in 2012 [<a href="#R90">90</a>]. In terms of income, East Asia has the lowest GDP per capita of Lao PDR (US$ 751)
               and the highest of Japan (US$ 37,433) in 2013 [<a href="#R91">91</a>]. In the Golden Triangle, the Balkans of Asia, there are numerous ethnic minorities
               sharing the national borders between Thailand, Myanmar and Lao for trade or employment.
               The International Organisation for Migration (IOM) [<a href="#R92">92</a>] recognises that irregular migration remains one of the biggest challenges across
               the region ‘with the most common forms being unauthorised labour migration movement
               and trafficking for labour and sexual exploitation, sometimes through international
               marriages’. The following sub-sections will introduce a few exemplary cases of irregular
               migration in relation to human (in)security, based on the author’s own reading, observation
               and fieldwork in the region for the past decade. The list is not exhaustive.

               <!-- named anchor --></a><h2 class="main-title">5.- Asylum Seeking</h2>
            <p id="d1e607">In forced migration, personal, community, political and environmental insecurities
               (physical safety, ethnic and political violence as well as natural disasters and man-made
               environmental damages) push migrants to neighbouring countries. Many ethnic minorities
               such as the Karen, Mon or Rohingya peoples escape from state-induced discrimination
               and armed conflict in Burma to neighbouring countries such as Thailand and Malaysia
               through whatever possible land and sea routes, despite the fact they are unauthorised
               channels (fieldwork in Ban Dong Yang and Mae La camps in Thailand and focus group
               interviews with 58 refugees in total between 2013 and 2015). Some pay for smugglers
               to get them out of situations of violence and poverty. Others are deceived by human
               traffickers and kept in confinement until ransom is paid or until they are sold for
               sex or labour exploitation. North Koreans also escape from state-induced political
               violence, food and economic insecurity, and severe floods and draught in the 1990s.
               They head to China and then down to Thailand, Vietnam or Cambodia, knowing that the
               border crossing is illegal both in sending and receiving countries (fieldwork in Yanbien,
               China in 1999, Seoul, South Korea in 2000–2005 and Bangkok, Thailand in 2012).
            </p>
            <p id="d1e609">International human rights or refugee laws have been ineffective in responding to
               imminent threats to asylum seekers and hosting populations as the states concerned
               do not fully respect human rights norms and instead prioritise sovereignty and national
               security. Burma, North Korea, China, Vietnam and Cambodia have the worst records of
               state compliance with international human rights and they are not bound by humanitarian
               or refugee conventions either. Under international law, none of the concerned countries
               show commitment to the respect for, or protection of, human rights for those vulnerable
               asylum seekers. These states merely treat these vulnerable individuals as illegal
               migrants who violate domestic immigration regulations. This does not deter asylum
               seekers from leaving their countries of origin (because it does not address the original
               issue of insecurity that pushes irregular migration), but it does encourage underground
               smuggling networks to grow, which places the migrants in greater danger.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e611">Because of the precarious and illegal status of asylum seekers and the lack of sufficient
               government measures, migrants’ food, health, environment and community securities
               are at stake in hosting countries (lack of access to basic food, exposure to unhygienic
               environments and communicable diseases, discrimination against certain ethnic groups
               or threats from locals to report to the authorities). For Karen refugees, Thailand
               offered temporary shelter for more than a decade where refugees received food, health
               services, basic education and vocational training. In the case of North Korean asylum
               seekers, China has turned a blind eye and they remain in the hands of underground
               Christian missionaries or smugglers. The existence of asylum seekers and refugees
               often creates diplomatic tension between sending and receiving countries. Burma and
               Thailand have regular dialogues how to handle the Karen refugees. Vietnam once sent
               486 North Koreans in a chartered Korean Air flight to South Korea and North Korea
               publicly condemned the decision. While Thailand allows some Karen refugees to remain
               as residents, China repatriates North Koreans and tightens border control, based on
               the bilateral agreement with North Korea. The latter case opens underground smuggling
               and trafficking networks that can penetrate borders, which only make both migrants
               and citizens more vulnerable and place regional security in greater danger. As China
               closes the borders with North Korea, the region’s economy slows down and community
               cohesion is disturbed [<a href="#R93">93</a>]. Trafficking in persons and people smuggling occur in commercial land and sea routes
               [<a href="#R94">94</a>]. Turbulent and poorly managed borders can also attract other related criminal activities
               such as goods smuggling and fraud [<a href="#R95">95</a>] that have impact on not just asylum seekers but the hosting populations.

            <p id="d1e625">The next group is undocumented labour migrants who seek better economic security and
               knowingly violate immigration rules and work permit requirements. These are mostly
               unskilled workers and they make up the largest number of migrant workers in Asia [<a href="#R96">96</a>]. There are no fixed sending or receiving countries. A decision to move to another
               country to find work is relative and non-linear. Decisions are made through interactions
               with migrants’ neighbours, families and friends. Employment agencies play a significant
               role and some have exploitative practices that are not regulated by states. While
               existing flows from countries like Bangladesh, Indonesia and the Philippines are constant,
               migrant workers from Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and Burma have also entered the global
               labour market. Among economic migrants who come with proper visas, many become irregular
               as they overstay or misuse visas. Up to one in four migrant workers in Asia may have
               illegal status [<a href="#R97">97</a>]. According to the International Labour Organisation [<a href="#R97">97</a>], labour flows from Indonesia and Thailand to Malaysia are largely illegal and Thailand
               hosts up to 1.7 million illegal workers. Undocumented migrants have no access to justice
               and are not entitled to legal protection from abuse, the non-payment of salaries.
               Bangladeshi or Nepalese factory workers in Japan overstay and become illegal migrants
               [<a href="#R98">98</a>]. Cambodian seasonal workers cross the border to Thailand without proper travel documents
               or work permits [<a href="#R99">99</a>]. Philippine sex workers enter Singapore with social visit passes and solicit in
               streets or bars (fieldwork in Singapore in 2012 and in-depth interviews with eight
               sex workers). They are targets of police raids and arrested for the breach of immigration
               rules.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e642">States treat them as illegal migrants who breach the national laws on immigration
               and work permits. Furthermore, the growth of irregular migration in East Asia is linked
               to both governments’ unwillingness to effectively manage migration and to employers’
               desire for cheap labour [<a href="#R100">100</a>]. Most Asian countries have tended to turn a blind eye to undocumented workers at
               times of economic growth and to campaigns of mass expulsion in economic downturns.
               These workers have no recourse or access to justice when their rights are violated.
               Hosting countries do not recognise their legal rights as the latter has no legal standing
               in the country of their residence. International human rights laws do little to protect
               irregular migrant workers. Most countries that host undocumented migrant workers have
               not signed or ratified the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights
               of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families [<a href="#R101">101</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e650">In the meantime, the very presence of undocumented labour migrants in a country, when
               not properly managed, poses potential threats to personal, community, economic, food,
               health and environmental securities for hosting societies. The public is exposed to
               health hazards from unmanaged epidemic or transmittable diseases through human contact
               because irregular migrants share the same space as host societies. Undocumented migrants
               are not covered by national healthcare systems. Accumulated grievances may trigger
               communal violence against the local population. Leaving undocumented migrant workers
               unprotected can create long-term socio-economic problems for hosting societies. Many
               governments, however, tend to focus on their illegal status and the deportation of
               these workers once caught no matter how long they have contributed to the hosting
               country’s economy. Repatriation may provide the concerned government a short-term
               cost-effective solution. However, in the long run, exploitation and unfair treatment
               can bring about unintended diplomatic and political conflict between the sending and
               receiving countries.

            <p id="d1e655">The third and fourth categories of irregular migrants are people who are affected
               by human trafficking and people smuggling. They include victims, survivors, their
               families, brokers, aid workers and anyone who migrate or have migrated to transport
               other people for the purposes of exploitation or for pure financial gain. These two
               terms are often confused. The former involves a form of exploitation in the final
               destination and can happen within a national boundary whereas the latter refers to
               the movement of people from one country to another through an unauthorised channel.
               In the case of trafficking, individual traffickers can be charged for their criminal
               activity. States can also be held responsible for failing to protect the human rights
               of trafficked persons. Smuggling, however, is defined as a transnational organised
               crime and no state is legally responsible for the protection of smuggled people unless
               they prove themselves exploited by smugglers or seek political refuge. Vulnerable
               populations who live in zones of conflict and poverty become targets of traffickers
               for exploitation. Young people are particularly vulnerable. North Korean women and
               women from refugee camps in Thailand are sold and resold to Chinese men as wives for
               sexual exploitation and domestic servitude [<a href="#R94">94</a>]. Young Vietnamese and Cambodian women are arranged to marry South Korean, Japanese
               and Taiwanese men through international match-making agencies who work for profit
               [<a href="#R15">15</a>]. Many of them are confined at home with their passports confiscated by their husbands.
               Uneducated and poor women and children from Burma and Indonesia work as domestic workers
               in Singapore, often not paid for several months or years because of the money they
               owe the employment agencies. They are also verbally and physically abused by their
               employers and denied their day-off from work [<a href="#R102">102</a>]. Their movements are managed by profit-oriented employment or marriage agencies.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e666">While not denying irregular migration has to be solved in part through the prosecution
               of organised criminals and protection of victims, it is also a serious human problem
               that needs to be seen from the agent’s perspective rather than treating them merely
               as criminals/victims and putting them in prisons/shelters. Poverty, lack of education
               and social stigma are identified as causes of trafficking in persons [<a href="#R103">103</a>, <a href="#R104">104</a>]. There are also other facilitating factors such as a symbiotic relationship between
               established (legalised) and underground (criminalised) sectors [<a href="#R105">105</a>]. Without assistance from local security guards, police and other law enforcement
               officials, irregular migration would be impossible. Trafficked or smuggled migrants,
               because of their precarious legal status, are exposed to the great risk of exploitation,
               fear of deportation, physical and mental abuses and other human rights violations
               and discrimination.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e677">Human rights are not likely to be a dominant foreign policy norm in the region. While
               only the Philippines and Indonesia are signatories to the International Convention
               of the Protection of Migrant Workers and Their Families, many East Asian countries
               have ratified the Convention against Transnational Organised Crime and its protocols
               on human trafficking and people smuggling [<a href="#R106">106</a>]. A rare occasion states act together is the recent migrant smuggling incidents at
               sea [<a href="#R107">107</a>]. It was security not human rights that made states respond to the crisis. International
               news cover the stories of stranded migrants at sea from Burma, Bangladesh and Sri
               Lanka which include all four irregular migrant groups I have described earlier in
               this paper. For example, they include Rohingya asylum seekers, many of whom are victims
               of human trafficking, and smuggled Bangladeshi migrants, who were to be undocumented
               migrant workers. The only two Muslim-majority countries, Malaysia and Indonesia, offered
               temporary shelters while the Thai, Singaporean and Australian governments turned them
               away [<a href="#R108">108</a>]. International humanitarian or human rights laws do little to change state behaviour
               when they collide with notions of state sovereignty and territorial integrity. The
               urgency human security attaches to stress the magnitude of impact on human lives has
               a better chance to induce state action.

               <!-- named anchor --></a><h2 class="main-title">8.- Conclusion</h2>
            <p id="d1e691">Irregular migration is a transnational human security problem that requires urgent
               extra-legal measures and goes beyond normal politics. International human rights norms
               have not been so effective as to induce state action to protect vulnerable migrants
               as well as hosting societies. For this reason, this article went in search for a more
               appropriate discourse that could capture the nature and impact of irregular migration
               on people. It found the 1994 UNDP’s seven pillars of human security most comprehensive
               and also parallel to the norms of international human rights with changing state responsibilities.
               The multifaceted 1994 UNDP framework moves away from the narrow vs. broad concepts
               of human security and helps better understand the causes and consequences as well
               as the constitutive processes of irregular migration. Human security does not challenge
               state sovereignty as much as the language of human rights appears to, but gives states
               greater ownership over the causes and consequences of human insecurity and the opportunity
               to exercise moral authority in international relations. It therefore has a better
               chance to induce state action than the existing human rights regime, especially in
               the East Asian context. This comprehensive human security approach to irregular migration
               stands a better chance than the narrow criminal justice or individualistic human rights
               perspectives.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e693">This article identifies the lack of personal, economic, food and environmental securities
               as the main drivers for irregular migration. Migrants move across their national borders
               to find a safer place for their survival, very often knowing that the way to do so
               is not authorised by the relevant migration regimes. They may reside in foreign countries
               without proper permits or with misused documents. The act of irregular migration,
               which is often forced by states or prompted by other profit-minded individuals or
               corrupt government officials, puts migrants under a new set of human insecurities
               not just for migrants themselves but also for hosting populations. Human insecurity
               caused by irregular migration is not a matter of migrants vs. citizens but a matter
               for all migrants and citizens. Human security provides a better normative framework
               to understand the motivations and human costs of irregular migration. Each trajectory
               of irregular migration has its own path dependency, learning curves, interactions
               with other stakeholders such as families, brokers, smugglers, employers or immigration
               officers, and feedback loops. Irregular migration is a complex system where a large
               number of heterogeneous agents are interacting with one another in a highly unpredictable
               manner.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e695">The current study introduces a number of case studies from East Asia. However, the
               implications described above can be universal. While being careful about providing
               concrete policy recommendations, I would argue restrictive immigration rules and political
               measures do not solve the problem. In fact, they drive migration underground and deepen
               human insecurity for vulnerable migrants and their hosts. Open borders do not automatically
               solve the problem, either. Open borders are highly unlikely, especially in Northeast
               Asia where North Korea is testing its nuclear and missile programmes. Even in Southeast
               Asia, the idea of open borders for a common market can only be realised in the distant
               future because of the income gap between the most and least developed countries in
               the region. Open borders without access to justice and information, socially responsible
               businesses and competent civil society will only drive already vulnerable migrants
               into increasingly exploitative environments. Providing basic food, healthcare and
               clean living conditions, regardless of a person’s legal status, is not just moral
               and humanitarian for all irregular migrants but would also be beneficial for better
               human security of the hosting society, too.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e697">With growing human insecurity not just caused by political violence but more and more
               by non-political factors such as poverty, underdevelopment, extremism, inequality,
               social exclusion, and environmental damage, scholars and practitioners in the field
               need to be able to understand the dynamic and complex nature of irregular migration.
               The process is not linear but highly unpredictable and constitutive. One such case
               is the growing number of environmental refugees who are not recognised by the 1951
               Refugee Convention or by any international protection regimes. More people are displaced
               by natural disasters, which immediately place those affected under highly vulnerable
               food, shelter, health and environmental conditions. These conditions subsequently
               lead to more serious and detrimental long-term economic deprivation and lack of education.
               IDPs and refugees then become targets for traffickers. Otherwise, those with resources
               flee using migrant smugglers and become undocumented labour migrants elsewhere. As
               I reiterated in this article, the criteria of irregular migration is extremely blurred
               in real life. The media and policy-makers are better informed by clear terminologies
               and types of irregular migrants laid out in this article so that when we have a refugee
               crisis, we do not call it a migrant crisis, or we do not call what is human trafficking
               migrant smuggling any more.

                              <!-- named anchor --></a>According to the Singaporean Ministry of Defence, `Total Defence' is composed of five
                           pillars: military, civil, economic, social and psychology defence, the last four of
                           which can be translated into political, economic, community and personal securities
                           among the seven human security criteria. Total Defence, however, stresses individual
                           citizen'’ responsibility to take part in the defence and to play a role for any type
                           of crises rather than the state’s responsibility to protect. \url http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/mindef_websites/topics/totaldefence/about_us/what_is_td.html#.VXzVRuuG_Zd
