                              current trends of irregular migration (both forced and unauthorised) in East Asia
                              and revisits the seven pillars of human security defined in the 1994 Human Development
                              Report by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). It explains how the concepts
                              of human security are parallel to those prescribed in international human rights conventions
                              but different in terms of the attitude towards states. Human security does not directly
                              challenge state authority and adds a sense of urgency and moral authority that requires
                              extra-legal measures by the states. The author argues that human security is the securitisation
                              of human rights and is a better framework and policy discourse than human rights to
                              engage with state and non-state actors, especially in East Asia where political leaders
                              are more receptive to the former idea. The study draws examples from stateless Rohingyas,
                              undocumented sex workers in Thailand and Singapore, trafficked brides from Vietnam
                              and Cambodia, and smuggled North Korean refugees in China to demonstrate the nexus
                              between human security and irregular migration.</span></div>

                              <p id="d1e77">In spite of the increasing roles played by individuals and non-state actors, states
                                 still hold the primary responsibilities to protect and guarantee human security of
                                 citizens and residents within their territorial borders. The State is not just an
                                 <i>actor</i> that enacts and amends legislation on transnational migration between states and
                                 implements policy measures, but is also a <i>structure</i> under which domestic and international, private and public actors, interact with
                                 one another. Transnational migration is one such area where states are the gate-keepers
                                 of their own territorial boundaries and provide rules and regulations about immigration.
                                 Cross-border migration can be approached from different perspectives. While state
                                 sovereignty, territorial integrity, national security or criminal justice perspectives
                                 represent a conservative voice [<a href="#R01">1</a>, <a href="#R02">2</a>, <a href="#R03">3</a>, <a href="#R04">4</a>, <a href="#R05">5</a>, <a href="#R06">6</a>, <a href="#R07">7</a>], liberal and critical scholars focus more on individual freedom of movement, the
                                 global economic structure and migrants’ socio-economic conditions [<a href="#R08">8</a>, <a href="#R09">9</a>, <a href="#R10">10</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e117">This article offers a critical review of different schools of thoughts on migration
                                 and security from conservative, liberal and critical perspectives, which is followed
                                 by a critical assessment of the Copenhagen School’s securitisation theory. The main
                                 purpose of the review is to examine how academic discourses of international security
                                 have evolved over the years, especially after the end of the Cold War, from state-
                                 and defence-centric to more people-centred perspectives, merged with other discourses
                                 of human rights and sustainable development. After an overview of key debates on human
                                 security, it examines the 1994 UNDP definition of the seven pillars of human security
                                 as the most comprehensive and encompassing framework. It conceptually dismantles the
                                 seven pillars—namely personal, community, political, economic, food health and environmental
                                 securities—and shows how similar the contents of human rights and human security are.
                                 It concludes that human security is the securitisation of human rights that attaches
                                 a sense of urgency and paramount importance to affected people, regardless of their
                                 legal status, and that requires extra-legal and extra-political measures by the concerned
                                 states.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e119">The study draws on a number of recent examples from East Asia (both South and North)
                                 where migrants risk their lives to cross the borders through unauthorised land or
                                 sea routes in order to relocate themselves and their families to more secure places.
                                 They include North Korean ‘smuggled refugees’ [<a href="#R11">11</a>], undocumented Cambodian workers and trafficked fishermen in Thailand [<a href="#R12">12</a>], overstayed Bangladeshi workers in Japan [<a href="#R13">13</a>], stateless Rohingyas [<a href="#R14">14</a>], trafficked Vietnamese brides in Korea [<a href="#R15">15</a>] and Karen refugees in Thailand [<a href="#R16">16</a>], to name a few. Migrant’ decisions to move across their national boundaries are
                                 driven by their natural instinct for survival to go to a more secure place even when
                                 the movement is unauthorised by relevant state authorities. Irregular migration is
                                 a highly complex area of studies as most cases present mixed migration with multiple
                                 causes in a vicious circle. In other words, a migrant who wanted to escape from poverty
                                 and discrimination, pays for a smuggler to cross the border and ends up being a victim
                                 of human trafficking. Where s/he is rescued, s/he realises s/he could have claimed
                                 refugee status, so s/he does. Still, s/he has no right to work. Within the broad category
                                 of unauthorised movement, the boundaries and key definitions of irregular migration
                                 (which includes undocumented labour migration, human trafficking, people smuggling
                                 and asylum seeking) are all blurred and the process of irregular migration is highly
                                 unpredictable.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e140">While migrants are in such dire conditions, the current human rights framework is
                                 insufficient to solve the problem. According to Article 13(2) of the 1948 Universal
                                 Declaration of Human Rights, individuals have the right to leave a country of origin.
                                 However, international human rights law does not provide an express right for the
                                 individual to reside elsewhere nor place a duty upon other states to receive them.
                                 Mobility is therefore incompletely defined and protected under the existing human
                                 rights regime. It is the states that decide whom they want to receive as residents,
                                 temporary and permanent alike, and accept as citizens. State obligations to protect
                                 and respect basic human rights of those who are not their citizens have not been properly
                                 observed under international law. In this regard, human security may offer a powerful
                                 language and discourse for international and regional cooperation to tackle irregular
                                 migration. The term promotes the urgency and paramount importance attached to affected
                                 people regardless of their legal status, as well as to hosting societies. Human security
                                 highlights the on-going challenge posed by irregular migration that requires immediate
                                 measures by the concerned states that go beyond traditionally defined domestic rules
                                 and regulations on immigration or charitable humanitarian consideration. By redefining
                                 the seven pillars of human security in the context of irregular migration in East
                                 Asia, the study contributes to the clarity of mixed terminologies and multiple causes
                                 of irregular migration as well as to the growing body of knowledge and theoretical
                                 development for the existing literature on the nexus between human insecurity and
                                 irregular migration.

                              <p id="d1e145">This section critically reviews three main theories of migration in relation to security.
                                 The real world of scholars and practitioners present a mixture of some of these basic
                                 ideas and the lines among the three schools are highly blurred (see Table <a href="#Tab1">1</a> below). Nevertheless, the purpose here is to provide the most distinctive lines of
                                 argument on this area. Philippe Bourdeau [<a href="#R01">1</a>] aptly introduces three models of securitisation of migration. The first and mainstream
                                 model is from the realist tradition of International Relations (IR). Robert Kaplan
                                 [<a href="#R17">17</a>] warned that Western states should fear the ‘coming anarchy’ associated with mass
                                 migration while Samuel Huntington [<a href="#R18">18</a>] declared that the persistent flow of Hispanic immigrants would constitute a major
                                 potential threat to America’s cultural and political identity. One of the most well-known
                                 conservative migration scholars is Myron Weiner [<a href="#R19">19</a>] who stated that ‘advanced industrial countries can protect their borders from invading
                                 armies but not from hordes of individuals who slip into harbours, crawl under barbed-wire
                                 fences and wade across rivers’. Weiner’s migration-security nexus [<a href="#R20">20</a>] draws what he calls the Security Stability Framework on how international migration
                                 creates conflict within and between countries from a realist perspective, which sees
                                 migration as a potential threat to national security. For realists, therefore, the
                                 expansion of international migration is dangerous for state sovereignty and the balance
                                 of power among states in the international system and would create violent conflicts
                                 among states [<a href="#R21">21</a>].
                                 
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e169">For liberals, on the other hand, national borders should be open for free trade, labour
                                 mobility and individual liberty, although there are several different sub-groups within
                                 the liberal camp. For example, neoliberals would advocate for free trade, fewer regulations
                                 and unrestricted labour mobility while classical liberals focus on individual liberty,
                                 human rights and justice. Liberal scholars envisage the ‘client politics model’ [<a href="#R22">22</a>, <a href="#R23">23</a>, <a href="#R24">24</a>] or the ‘embedded liberalism model’ [<a href="#R25">25</a>, <a href="#R26">26</a>], both of which support freedom of movements. In this liberal perspective, international
                                 institutions and international laws are supposed to set rules and regulations that
                                 respect individual freedom and democracy, and that contribute to shaping more cooperative
                                 and open-minded state behaviour towards globalisation and international migration.
                                 Free(r) movements, however, on the contrary, have made many migrant workers’ conditions
                                 worse instead of helping them alleviate poverty, underdevelopment and corruption,
                                 an issue which the next group of scholars address.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e186">Critical theorists oppose both realist and liberal views, arguing that security is
                                 neither about survival nor about urgency and exceptional practices. Rather, security
                                 is the ‘result of mundane bureaucratic decisions of everyday politics that create
                                 a sense of insecurity, fear, danger and unease’ [<a href="#R27">27</a>, <a href="#R28">28</a>]. Didier Bigo identifies this as the ‘governmentality of unease’. According to him,
                                 the securitisation process is above all ‘routinised practices of professionals of
                                 security, essentially police and bureaucrats’. This relates to Ole Wæver’s securitisation
                                 theory to identify existential threats from imagined enemies and to highlight ‘speech
                                 act’. The speech acts are not only done by bureaucrats or security professionals but
                                 also by the conservative media, nationalist politicians or xenophobic individuals
                                 who post their opinions on the Internet and they spread over a few minutes across
                                 space. The state (or Bigo’s security professionals), in this sense, waits until normative
                                 equilibrium is reached in the society and belatedly reacts to social demands in democratic
                                 society. Threats may not exist, but fear does endogenously within individuals living
                                 in the system of mass migration. It is not just created by external sources of bureaucrats.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e194">The Copenhagen School, which is part of the critical theory and is led by Wæver, gives
                                 specific methodological insights into the securitisation of irregular migration. Barry
                                 Buzan’s Securitisation Theory (ST) [<a href="#R29">29</a>, <a href="#R30">30</a>] provides a framework to theorise how East Asian states are securitising irregular
                                 migration and to identify which security norms the states are constituting and utilising
                                 over the years. As Bourdeau [<a href="#R01">1</a>] says, ST is ‘the most widely applied and fully developed model of relationships
                                 between migration and security’ and a ‘most creative and productive analytical framework’.
                                 Securitisation is, by definition, the ‘process of integrating migration discursively
                                 and institutionally into security frameworks that emphasise policing and defence’
                                 [<a href="#R01">1</a>]. Like social constructivism [<a href="#R31">31</a>], one of the greatest strengths of ST is that it shifts the focus of analysis away
                                 from merely material factors to socio-cultural and normative ones.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e211">Wæver [<a href="#R32">32</a>] himself identifies his own ST as an analysis of ‘actual linguistic practices to
                                 see what regulates discourse’. The Copenhagen School examines what practitioners ‘do
                                 in talking security’. Wæver’s notion of security is that it is the ‘result of a move
                                 that takes politics beyond the established rules of the game and frames the issue
                                 as above normal politics’, which also applies to human security. However, his interpretation
                                 of the designation of existential threat is negative in a sense that it is only to
                                 justify the use of extraordinary measures or special powers such as enforcement and
                                 secrecy. His view of security is a ‘failure to deal with issues as normal politics’.
                                 For Wæver, therefore, de-securitisation is the optimal long-range solution, which
                                 limits the scope for interpretations of security to human dimensions.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e216">I would add a new human dimension to Waever’s ST. There have been changing conceptions
                                 of security from state-centric to people-centred. I would still place this new dimension
                                 under the post-structural critical school as my version of human security framework
                                 is going beyond both realist/liberal rational theory and instead focusing on non-linear
                                 circular processes of human insecurity and irregular migration. Previous work on the
                                 securitisation of migration focus on the negative notion of security as urgency, control
                                 and power [<a href="#R33">33</a>, <a href="#R23">23</a>]. Maggie Ibrahim [<a href="#R34">34</a>] for example, calls the securitisation of migration the ‘latest and most modern form
                                 of racism’. In fact, fear-mongering, criminal imagery of migrants, witch-hunting or
                                 ‘othering’ particular ethnic groups are old tactics of securitisation of migrants.
                                 However, this limited and negative state-centric perspective of securitisation does
                                 not capture the changed concepts of security in a more humane way and that includes
                                 considerations of the agency of migrants. The Rohingya boat people crisis in May 2015
                                 also presents multi-faceted human security issues of irregular migration concerning
                                 the poverty, conflict and discrimination that drive migrants into the illegal sea
                                 routes that are operated by traffickers.

                                 evidence. As Bigo [<a href="#R28">28</a>, <a href="#R35">35</a>], the founding father of the Paris School, points out, actual policy practices often
                                 reveal patterns different from those found in official discourses. Many have tried
                                 to fill this gap. Bourdeau [<a href="#R01">1</a>] brings his own cases from Canada and France whereas Melissa G. Curley and Wong Siu-lun
                                 [<a href="#R36">36</a>] provide Northeast Asian case studies. Feminist security studies offer valuable observations
                                 and analyses on how different forms of migration are securitised or under-securitised
                                 [<a href="#R37">37</a>, <a href="#R38">38</a>, <a href="#R39">39</a>, <a href="#R40">40</a>, <a href="#R41">41</a>], which provided inspiration for the current study. Migrants’ self-organising behaviour
                                 and interactions among themselves and with the state migration regimes are key to
                                 understanding the evolutionary correlation between migration and security.

                              <p id="d1e317">As explained above, the conventional notion of security focuses on national defence,
                                 military security or territorial integrity of sovereign states, virtually synonymous
                                 with ‘defence’ [<a href="#R42">42</a>, <a href="#R43">43</a>]. Notions of personal, cultural or environmental security emerged and the reconceptualisation
                                 of security has been carried out by IR theorists [<a href="#R30">30</a>, <a href="#R42">42</a>, <a href="#R44">44</a>, <a href="#R44">44</a>, <a href="#R45">45</a>, <a href="#R46">46</a>, <a href="#R47">47</a>, <a href="#R48">48</a>, <a href="#R49">49</a>, <a href="#R50">50</a>, <a href="#R51">51</a>]. The major breakthrough was the 1994 UNDP report. In the report, the UNDP laid out
                                 two broad categories of human security: ‘freedom from fear’ and ‘freedom from want’
                                 [<a href="#R52">52</a>, <a href="#R53">53</a>, <a href="#R54">54</a>]. It argued that ‘human security is not a concern with weapons—it is a concern with
                                 human life and dignity’, best insured through prevention and people-centeredness.
                                 It detailed seven components of human security: personal, community, political, economic,
                                 food, energy and environment securities that are interdependent with one another.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e369">Since then, human security has been revisited for further investigation for its utility
                                 and its relation to other global political concerns [<a href="#R43">43</a>, <a href="#R55">55</a>, <a href="#R56">56</a>, <a href="#R57">57</a>]. Some have a narrow definition of human security as ‘vulnerability to physical violence
                                 during conflict’ [<a href="#R58">58</a>] while others share a broader concept, linking it with other areas such as development
                                 or globalisation [<a href="#R59">59</a>, <a href="#R60">60</a>], which is often represented as the Canadian vs. Japanese conceptions of human security
                                 [<a href="#R61">61</a>]. Ernst Haas [<a href="#R62">62</a>] long argued that the security literature needs to learn from the ‘evolutionary epistemology’
                                 of global life. Similarly, Mark Duffield [<a href="#R63">63</a>] agrees that human security provides a means of distinguishing geopolitics, the security
                                 of states, from biopolitics, the security of population. For many in East Asia, economic,
                                 food, energy and environmental issues are real and immediate threats to their peoples’
                                 survival and resilience. Developing countries like Myanmar, Vietnam, Cambodia, the
                                 Philippines and Indonesia send many economic and marriage migrants overseas and migrants
                                 send remittance back to their countries of origin. North Korea has chronic food shortage
                                 [<a href="#R64">64</a>, <a href="#R65">65</a>, <a href="#R66">66</a>]. China, Japan and South Korea started planning to secure long-term food security,
                                 especially rice, and energy security, which both involve seasonal labour forces. Japan,
                                 Indonesia and the Philippines are vulnerable to natural disasters such as typhoons,
                                 whereas the Greater Mekong region faces man-made environmental degradation through
                                 mining and dam construction, activities that result in forced eviction at times.

                              <p id="d1e412">Each state’s historical (post-colonial), political and cultural backgrounds constitute
                                 its attitude to human <i>rights</i> vs. human <i>security</i>. Many in East Asia were under Western colonial rule (except for Korea which was under
                                 the Japanese rule) and have authoritarian political structures, which have been deeply
                                 embedded in hierarchical male-dominant role-based cultures or religions. Governments
                                 are under pressure for their lack of transparency and accountability, rising middle-classes
                                 or ethnic rivalry. In this environment, the political elites are more receptive toward
                                 the idea of collective (human) <i>security</i> while being resistant to individual human <i>rights</i>. A state as an actor also wants to survive as individual migrants do. The former
                                 prime ministers of Singapore and Malaysia, Lee Kuan Yew and Mahathir bin Mohamad,
                                 for example, defined human rights as Western concepts that were not suitable for many
                                 Asian countries. The former Singaporean foreign minister Kishore Mahbubani also argues
                                 that human rights are an ‘aggressive alien Western concept’ [<a href="#R67">67</a>]. The default assumption in human rights is that the state is the potential perpetrator
                                 either by committing human rights violations or by omitting its obligations to protect
                                 human rights. State-society relations are confrontational under the doctrine of human
                                 rights. In the language of human security, however, states remain the primary guarantors
                                 of human security or providers of goods and services for people’s well-being while
                                 being able to establish normal authority in international society by looking after
                                 its own people as well as vulnerable migrants. Having a closer examination of the
                                 contents of the seven pillars of human security endorsed by the UNDP in 1994 [<a href="#R52">52</a>], however, I would argue that they are all within the realm of international human
                                 rights as seen below Table <a href="#Tab2">2</a>.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e436">Whereas human rights challenge state authority and sovereignty and often accuse states
                                 of being potential perpetrators, human security expects state moral authority, expands
                                 state responsibilities to non-citizens, i.e. vulnerable migrants regardless of their
                                 legal status, and urges trans-political supra-national measures that go beyond existing
                                 national mechanisms. It is the urgency and the magnitude of impact on vulnerable irregular
                                 migrants that transcends state sovereignty and territorial integrity and that can
                                 affect hosting societies on a greater scale if no proper measures are taken in time.
                                 This requires immediate transnational cooperation. In this regard, a good state may
                                 want to seize the opportunity to take ownership of human security and play a responsible
                                 role for the regional security.

                              <p id="d1e503">Unlike the misconceived idea of human rights as an imperial Western concept among
                                 many authoritarian leaders in East Asia, human security has the potential to grow
                                 more as a foreign policy concept. There are signs many East Asian elites are already
                                 receptive to the idea of human security. Amitav Acharya [<a href="#R68">68</a>] went even further, arguing that human security is originally an ‘Asian’ concept
                                 as Mahbub ul Haq, who is the main author of detailing the concepts of human security
                                 in the 1994 UNDP report, is an ‘Asian’ scholar. Japan has initiated the Asian approach
                                 to human security by embracing socio-economic aspects such as food and energy security
                                 in contrast to the Canadian emphasis on the ‘freedom from fear’ in armed conflict.
                                 The Japanese government saw human security comprehensively covering ‘all the menaces
                                 that threaten human survival, daily life and dignity—for example, environment degradation,
                                 violations of human rights, transnational organised crime, illicit drugs, refugees,
                                 poverty, anti-personal landmines and other infectious diseases such as AIDS’ [<a href="#R43">43</a>, <a href="#R69">69</a>]. Japan’s comprehensive security, therefore, bears both a traditional statist notion
                                 of closer military cooperation with the US and non-traditional economic, energy and
                                 food security [<a href="#R70">70</a>]. Although Acharya [<a href="#R68">68</a>] remains pessimistic in arguing that ASEAN countries’ main concern is regime survival
                                 and legitimation as in the case of Singapore’s ‘Total Defence’ [<a href="#R71">71</a>] rather than genuine concern for people’s well-being and security, the two are inseparable.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e524">Furthermore, some East Asian leaders embrace and mobilise human security in their
                                 public speeches [<a href="#R72">72</a>, <a href="#R73">73</a>, <a href="#R74">74</a>] (on the Asian conception of human security, see: [<a href="#R75">75</a>, <a href="#R76">76</a>]). In 2002, Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji and ASEAN leaders jointly declared on cooperation
                                 in the field of non-traditional security at the sixth China-ASEAN Summit in Phnom
                                 Penh, Cambodia. At the Symposium on ‘Realizing Human Security in Asia’ in Tokyo in
                                 2010, the Secretary-General of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and former
                                 Thai Foreign Minister, Surin Pitsuwan, endorsed the concept of human security as ‘a
                                 rather comprehensive concept…[that]…will not be in competition with the issue of state
                                 sovereignty. In fact, it is making the state’s sovereignty more meaningful because
                                 state security and state sovereignty, also would involve responsibility’ [<a href="#R77">77</a>]. Pitsuwan also connected the concept to social safety nets in the wake of the 1997
                                 Asian Financial Crisis. In the recent publication of the Armed Forces of the Philippines
                                 [<a href="#R78">78</a>] Internal Peace and Security Plan: Bayanihan, the whole-of-nation ‘human security’
                                 approaches were identified as the strategic planning for peace and security, natural
                                 disasters and other illicit activities such as human trafficking, piracy and people
                                 smuggling.

                              <p id="d1e551">The final section of the article examines the nexus between human (in)security and
                                 irregular migration. Many have tried to bring in broader concepts of human security
                                 in migration studies, rather than traditional national and border security perspectives.
                                 Elspeth Guild and Joanne van Selm [<a href="#R79">79</a>] reconceptualise security as ‘political and legal security’, ‘cultural and identity
                                 security’ and ‘personal and economic security’ in their study on the impact of immigrants
                                 on hosting countries. Literature on the migration-development nexus [<a href="#R80">80</a>, <a href="#R81">81</a>], migration-development-security [<a href="#R82">82</a>], and migration-globalisation-human security [<a href="#R83">83</a>] employs people-centred security concepts. The nexus between human insecurity and
                                 irregular migration has been observed in the East Asian context. Dewi F. Anwar [<a href="#R84">84</a>] has tried to weave together the ideas of human rights, security and irregular migration.
                                 In particular, she identified new threats to human security as the exploitation of
                                 irregular workers, the growing incidence of people smuggling and human trafficking.
                                 However, Anwar did not concretise the contents of human security and used the term
                                 with ‘non-traditional’ security interchangeably, which made the concept very vague.
                                 With further embodiment and comparison with established international human rights
                                 norms, the UNDP’s human security lens can provide an alternative agent-based analysis
                                 for the motivations of migrants, the vulnerability they face as well as the potential
                                 or imagined threats they pose to hosting societies.

                              <p id="d1e572">Human (in)security has been the main driver for irregular migration. Because of their

                                 they end up), which feeds into the vicious cycle of insecurity-triggered migratory
                                 patterns. Unless this vicious circle is broken by urgent extra-legal measures by the
                                 concerned states, both vulnerable migrants and hosting societies can end up in highly
                                 insecure situations. In spite of the greater risk that irregular migration poses for
                                 all societies, the term ‘irregular migration’ has been associated with the illegality
                                 of people’s movements. It is labelled clandestine, illegal, <i>sans papier</i> (undocumented), uncontrolled, unlawful, unauthorised, alien without residence status,
                                 or non-compliant. In 1974, the United Nations made the first reference to irregular
                                 migration in connection with the treatment of ‘illegal aliens’ [<a href="#R85">85</a>]. In the following year, the UN General Assembly adopted Resolution 3449 (30) where
                                 it called on the UN system to use the term ‘non-documented’ or ‘irregular’ in official
                                 documents rather than ‘illegal’ migrants. The International Organization for Migration
                                 defines irregular migration as the ‘movement that takes place outside the regulatory
                                 norms of the sending, transit and receiving countries’. I would define irregular migration
                                 as emerging patterns of people’s mobility that does not conform to established rules,
                                 norms, customs or morality, which include unauthorised illegal migration as well as
                                 forced migration. Following Martin Ruhs and Bridget Anderson’s compliance approach
                                 [<a href="#R86">86</a>], ‘unauthorised’ here has two meanings: one is movement that has not abided by existing
                                 migration regulations in a given state and the other is that states do not have laws
                                 (yet) to regulate illicit migration. For this article, people ‘affected’ [<a href="#R87">87</a>] by irregular migration fall into four categories: 1) unregistered, overstayed or
                                 misusing-visa labour migrants; 2) asylum seekers, stateless people, or IDPs; 3) trafficked
                                 persons or 4) smuggled people. In reality, however, these four categories are blurred
                                 and cross-boundary: undocumented Cambodian fishermen become easy targets for traffickers
                                 [<a href="#R88">88</a>] and North Korean asylum seekers in China get ‘help’ from missionary smugglers to
                                 use the underground railway to cross the border to Southeast Asia [<a href="#R89">89</a>].

                              <p id="d1e593">East Asia produces a large number of irregular migrants inter-regionally but also
                                 intra-regionally. Border controls are not rigidly enforced in certain places due to
                                 geographical challenges or the lack of government capacity. East Asia’s diverse and
                                 vibrant environments create intra-regional migration for labour, sex, marriage or
                                 freedom. East Asia has high degrees of demographic, political, economic, socio-cultural
                                 and ethnic diversity, which makes the cross-border movements more frequent and fluid
                                 as in diffusion and osmosis in physics. In China, it has the world’s biggest population
                                 of 1.38 billion and one of the smallest, Brunei with only 412,000 in 2012 [<a href="#R90">90</a>]. In terms of income, East Asia has the lowest GDP per capita of Lao PDR (US$ 751)
                                 and the highest of Japan (US$ 37,433) in 2013 [<a href="#R91">91</a>]. In the Golden Triangle, the Balkans of Asia, there are numerous ethnic minorities
                                 sharing the national borders between Thailand, Myanmar and Lao for trade or employment.
                                 The International Organisation for Migration (IOM) [<a href="#R92">92</a>] recognises that irregular migration remains one of the biggest challenges across
                                 the region ‘with the most common forms being unauthorised labour migration movement
                                 and trafficking for labour and sexual exploitation, sometimes through international
                                 marriages’. The following sub-sections will introduce a few exemplary cases of irregular
                                 migration in relation to human (in)security, based on the author’s own reading, observation
                                 and fieldwork in the region for the past decade. The list is not exhaustive.

                                 (physical safety, ethnic and political violence as well as natural disasters and man-made
                                 environmental damages) push migrants to neighbouring countries. Many ethnic minorities
                                 such as the Karen, Mon or Rohingya peoples escape from state-induced discrimination
                                 and armed conflict in Burma to neighbouring countries such as Thailand and Malaysia
                                 through whatever possible land and sea routes, despite the fact they are unauthorised
                                 channels (fieldwork in Ban Dong Yang and Mae La camps in Thailand and focus group
                                 interviews with 58 refugees in total between 2013 and 2015). Some pay for smugglers
                                 to get them out of situations of violence and poverty. Others are deceived by human
                                 traffickers and kept in confinement until ransom is paid or until they are sold for
                                 sex or labour exploitation. North Koreans also escape from state-induced political
                                 violence, food and economic insecurity, and severe floods and draught in the 1990s.
                                 They head to China and then down to Thailand, Vietnam or Cambodia, knowing that the
                                 border crossing is illegal both in sending and receiving countries (fieldwork in Yanbien,
                                 China in 1999, Seoul, South Korea in 2000–2005 and Bangkok, Thailand in 2012).

                              <p id="d1e609">International human rights or refugee laws have been ineffective in responding to
                                 imminent threats to asylum seekers and hosting populations as the states concerned
                                 do not fully respect human rights norms and instead prioritise sovereignty and national
                                 security. Burma, North Korea, China, Vietnam and Cambodia have the worst records of
                                 state compliance with international human rights and they are not bound by humanitarian
                                 or refugee conventions either. Under international law, none of the concerned countries
                                 show commitment to the respect for, or protection of, human rights for those vulnerable
                                 asylum seekers. These states merely treat these vulnerable individuals as illegal
                                 migrants who violate domestic immigration regulations. This does not deter asylum
                                 seekers from leaving their countries of origin (because it does not address the original
                                 issue of insecurity that pushes irregular migration), but it does encourage underground
                                 smuggling networks to grow, which places the migrants in greater danger.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e611">Because of the precarious and illegal status of asylum seekers and the lack of sufficient
                                 government measures, migrants’ food, health, environment and community securities
                                 are at stake in hosting countries (lack of access to basic food, exposure to unhygienic
                                 environments and communicable diseases, discrimination against certain ethnic groups
                                 or threats from locals to report to the authorities). For Karen refugees, Thailand
                                 offered temporary shelter for more than a decade where refugees received food, health
                                 services, basic education and vocational training. In the case of North Korean asylum
                                 seekers, China has turned a blind eye and they remain in the hands of underground
                                 Christian missionaries or smugglers. The existence of asylum seekers and refugees
                                 often creates diplomatic tension between sending and receiving countries. Burma and
                                 Thailand have regular dialogues how to handle the Karen refugees. Vietnam once sent
                                 486 North Koreans in a chartered Korean Air flight to South Korea and North Korea
                                 publicly condemned the decision. While Thailand allows some Karen refugees to remain
                                 as residents, China repatriates North Koreans and tightens border control, based on
                                 the bilateral agreement with North Korea. The latter case opens underground smuggling
                                 and trafficking networks that can penetrate borders, which only make both migrants
                                 and citizens more vulnerable and place regional security in greater danger. As China
                                 closes the borders with North Korea, the region’s economy slows down and community
                                 cohesion is disturbed [<a href="#R93">93</a>]. Trafficking in persons and people smuggling occur in commercial land and sea routes
                                 [<a href="#R94">94</a>]. Turbulent and poorly managed borders can also attract other related criminal activities
                                 such as goods smuggling and fraud [<a href="#R95">95</a>] that have impact on not just asylum seekers but the hosting populations.

                              <p id="d1e625">The next group is undocumented labour migrants who seek better economic security and
                                 knowingly violate immigration rules and work permit requirements. These are mostly
                                 unskilled workers and they make up the largest number of migrant workers in Asia [<a href="#R96">96</a>]. There are no fixed sending or receiving countries. A decision to move to another
                                 country to find work is relative and non-linear. Decisions are made through interactions
                                 with migrants’ neighbours, families and friends. Employment agencies play a significant
                                 role and some have exploitative practices that are not regulated by states. While
                                 existing flows from countries like Bangladesh, Indonesia and the Philippines are constant,
                                 migrant workers from Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and Burma have also entered the global
                                 labour market. Among economic migrants who come with proper visas, many become irregular
                                 as they overstay or misuse visas. Up to one in four migrant workers in Asia may have
                                 illegal status [<a href="#R97">97</a>]. According to the International Labour Organisation [<a href="#R97">97</a>], labour flows from Indonesia and Thailand to Malaysia are largely illegal and Thailand
                                 hosts up to 1.7 million illegal workers. Undocumented migrants have no access to justice
                                 and are not entitled to legal protection from abuse, the non-payment of salaries.
                                 Bangladeshi or Nepalese factory workers in Japan overstay and become illegal migrants
                                 [<a href="#R98">98</a>]. Cambodian seasonal workers cross the border to Thailand without proper travel documents
                                 or work permits [<a href="#R99">99</a>]. Philippine sex workers enter Singapore with social visit passes and solicit in
                                 streets or bars (fieldwork in Singapore in 2012 and in-depth interviews with eight
                                 sex workers). They are targets of police raids and arrested for the breach of immigration
                                 rules.

                                 and work permits. Furthermore, the growth of irregular migration in East Asia is linked
                                 to both governments’ unwillingness to effectively manage migration and to employers’
                                 desire for cheap labour [<a href="#R100">100</a>]. Most Asian countries have tended to turn a blind eye to undocumented workers at
                                 times of economic growth and to campaigns of mass expulsion in economic downturns.
                                 These workers have no recourse or access to justice when their rights are violated.
                                 Hosting countries do not recognise their legal rights as the latter has no legal standing
                                 in the country of their residence. International human rights laws do little to protect
                                 irregular migrant workers. Most countries that host undocumented migrant workers have
                                 not signed or ratified the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights
                                 of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families [<a href="#R101">101</a>].

                              <p id="d1e650">In the meantime, the very presence of undocumented labour migrants in a country, when
                                 not properly managed, poses potential threats to personal, community, economic, food,
                                 health and environmental securities for hosting societies. The public is exposed to
                                 health hazards from unmanaged epidemic or transmittable diseases through human contact
                                 because irregular migrants share the same space as host societies. Undocumented migrants
                                 are not covered by national healthcare systems. Accumulated grievances may trigger
                                 communal violence against the local population. Leaving undocumented migrant workers
                                 unprotected can create long-term socio-economic problems for hosting societies. Many
                                 governments, however, tend to focus on their illegal status and the deportation of
                                 these workers once caught no matter how long they have contributed to the hosting
                                 country’s economy. Repatriation may provide the concerned government a short-term
                                 cost-effective solution. However, in the long run, exploitation and unfair treatment
                                 can bring about unintended diplomatic and political conflict between the sending and
                                 receiving countries.

                                 by human trafficking and people smuggling. They include victims, survivors, their

                                 other people for the purposes of exploitation or for pure financial gain. These two

                                 destination and can happen within a national boundary whereas the latter refers to
                                 the movement of people from one country to another through an unauthorised channel.
                                 In the case of trafficking, individual traffickers can be charged for their criminal
                                 activity. States can also be held responsible for failing to protect the human rights
                                 of trafficked persons. Smuggling, however, is defined as a transnational organised
                                 crime and no state is legally responsible for the protection of smuggled people unless
                                 they prove themselves exploited by smugglers or seek political refuge. Vulnerable
                                 populations who live in zones of conflict and poverty become targets of traffickers
                                 for exploitation. Young people are particularly vulnerable. North Korean women and
                                 women from refugee camps in Thailand are sold and resold to Chinese men as wives for
                                 sexual exploitation and domestic servitude [<a href="#R94">94</a>]. Young Vietnamese and Cambodian women are arranged to marry South Korean, Japanese
                                 and Taiwanese men through international match-making agencies who work for profit
                                 [<a href="#R15">15</a>]. Many of them are confined at home with their passports confiscated by their husbands.
                                 Uneducated and poor women and children from Burma and Indonesia work as domestic workers
                                 in Singapore, often not paid for several months or years because of the money they
                                 owe the employment agencies. They are also verbally and physically abused by their
                                 employers and denied their day-off from work [<a href="#R102">102</a>]. Their movements are managed by profit-oriented employment or marriage agencies.

                              <p id="d1e666">While not denying irregular migration has to be solved in part through the prosecution
                                 of organised criminals and protection of victims, it is also a serious human problem
                                 that needs to be seen from the agent’s perspective rather than treating them merely
                                 as criminals/victims and putting them in prisons/shelters. Poverty, lack of education
                                 and social stigma are identified as causes of trafficking in persons [<a href="#R103">103</a>, <a href="#R104">104</a>]. There are also other facilitating factors such as a symbiotic relationship between
                                 established (legalised) and underground (criminalised) sectors [<a href="#R105">105</a>]. Without assistance from local security guards, police and other law enforcement
                                 officials, irregular migration would be impossible. Trafficked or smuggled migrants,
                                 because of their precarious legal status, are exposed to the great risk of exploitation,
                                 fear of deportation, physical and mental abuses and other human rights violations
                                 and discrimination.

                              <p id="d1e677">Human rights are not likely to be a dominant foreign policy norm in the region. While
                                 only the Philippines and Indonesia are signatories to the International Convention
                                 of the Protection of Migrant Workers and Their Families, many East Asian countries
                                 have ratified the Convention against Transnational Organised Crime and its protocols
                                 on human trafficking and people smuggling [<a href="#R106">106</a>]. A rare occasion states act together is the recent migrant smuggling incidents at
                                 sea [<a href="#R107">107</a>]. It was security not human rights that made states respond to the crisis. International
                                 news cover the stories of stranded migrants at sea from Burma, Bangladesh and Sri
                                 Lanka which include all four irregular migrant groups I have described earlier in
                                 this paper. For example, they include Rohingya asylum seekers, many of whom are victims
                                 of human trafficking, and smuggled Bangladeshi migrants, who were to be undocumented
                                 migrant workers. The only two Muslim-majority countries, Malaysia and Indonesia, offered
                                 temporary shelters while the Thai, Singaporean and Australian governments turned them
                                 away [<a href="#R108">108</a>]. International humanitarian or human rights laws do little to change state behaviour
                                 when they collide with notions of state sovereignty and territorial integrity. The
                                 urgency human security attaches to stress the magnitude of impact on human lives has
                                 a better chance to induce state action.

                              <p id="d1e691">Irregular migration is a transnational human security problem that requires urgent
                                 extra-legal measures and goes beyond normal politics. International human rights norms
                                 have not been so effective as to induce state action to protect vulnerable migrants
                                 as well as hosting societies. For this reason, this article went in search for a more
                                 appropriate discourse that could capture the nature and impact of irregular migration
                                 on people. It found the 1994 UNDP’s seven pillars of human security most comprehensive
                                 and also parallel to the norms of international human rights with changing state responsibilities.
                                 The multifaceted 1994 UNDP framework moves away from the narrow vs. broad concepts
                                 of human security and helps better understand the causes and consequences as well
                                 as the constitutive processes of irregular migration. Human security does not challenge
                                 state sovereignty as much as the language of human rights appears to, but gives states
                                 greater ownership over the causes and consequences of human insecurity and the opportunity
                                 to exercise moral authority in international relations. It therefore has a better
                                 chance to induce state action than the existing human rights regime, especially in
                                 the East Asian context. This comprehensive human security approach to irregular migration
                                 stands a better chance than the narrow criminal justice or individualistic human rights
                                 perspectives.

                              <p id="d1e693">This article identifies the lack of personal, economic, food and environmental securities
                                 as the main drivers for irregular migration. Migrants move across their national borders
                                 to find a safer place for their survival, very often knowing that the way to do so
                                 is not authorised by the relevant migration regimes. They may reside in foreign countries
                                 without proper permits or with misused documents. The act of irregular migration,
                                 which is often forced by states or prompted by other profit-minded individuals or
                                 corrupt government officials, puts migrants under a new set of human insecurities
                                 not just for migrants themselves but also for hosting populations. Human insecurity
                                 caused by irregular migration is not a matter of migrants vs. citizens but a matter
                                 for all migrants and citizens. Human security provides a better normative framework
                                 to understand the motivations and human costs of irregular migration. Each trajectory
                                 of irregular migration has its own path dependency, learning curves, interactions
                                 with other stakeholders such as families, brokers, smugglers, employers or immigration
                                 officers, and feedback loops. Irregular migration is a complex system where a large
                                 number of heterogeneous agents are interacting with one another in a highly unpredictable
                                 manner.

                              <p id="d1e695">The current study introduces a number of case studies from East Asia. However, the
                                 implications described above can be universal. While being careful about providing
                                 concrete policy recommendations, I would argue restrictive immigration rules and political
                                 measures do not solve the problem. In fact, they drive migration underground and deepen
                                 human insecurity for vulnerable migrants and their hosts. Open borders do not automatically
                                 solve the problem, either. Open borders are highly unlikely, especially in Northeast
                                 Asia where North Korea is testing its nuclear and missile programmes. Even in Southeast
                                 Asia, the idea of open borders for a common market can only be realised in the distant
                                 future because of the income gap between the most and least developed countries in
                                 the region. Open borders without access to justice and information, socially responsible
                                 businesses and competent civil society will only drive already vulnerable migrants
                                 into increasingly exploitative environments. Providing basic food, healthcare and
                                 clean living conditions, regardless of a person’s legal status, is not just moral
                                 and humanitarian for all irregular migrants but would also be beneficial for better
                                 human security of the hosting society, too.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e697">With growing human insecurity not just caused by political violence but more and more
                                 by non-political factors such as poverty, underdevelopment, extremism, inequality,
                                 social exclusion, and environmental damage, scholars and practitioners in the field
                                 need to be able to understand the dynamic and complex nature of irregular migration.
                                 The process is not linear but highly unpredictable and constitutive. One such case
                                 is the growing number of environmental refugees who are not recognised by the 1951
                                 Refugee Convention or by any international protection regimes. More people are displaced
                                 by natural disasters, which immediately place those affected under highly vulnerable
                                 food, shelter, health and environmental conditions. These conditions subsequently
                                 lead to more serious and detrimental long-term economic deprivation and lack of education.
                                 IDPs and refugees then become targets for traffickers. Otherwise, those with resources
                                 flee using migrant smugglers and become undocumented labour migrants elsewhere. As
                                 I reiterated in this article, the criteria of irregular migration is extremely blurred
                                 in real life. The media and policy-makers are better informed by clear terminologies
                                 and types of irregular migrants laid out in this article so that when we have a refugee
                                 crisis, we do not call it a migrant crisis, or we do not call what is human trafficking
                                 migrant smuggling any more.
