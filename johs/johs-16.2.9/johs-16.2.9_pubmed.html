                  <p class="first" id="d1e58">This article asks how variations of state territorial control have influenced police
                     missions in the recent past, and illustrate how recent police reforms were based on
                     the structure of a ‘western’ type state with clearly identifiable formal state institutions
                     enjoying autonomy, that strive for a form of territorial monopoly over violence. The
                     article argues for moving beyond such assumptions by adopting scenarios based on how
                     territory is controlled, developing four scenarios that can enable foreign-backed
                     police missions to adapt to local circumstances. The article draws upon the typology
                     of territorial control developed by Hansen in 2017/2019, amending this model to be
                     adapted for policing. It argues that each of these scenarios require different strategies
                     and compromises in order to create functioning police forces.

            <p id="d1e75">International guidelines for policing tend to put focus upon the state. This generally
               entails reconstructing institutions based on a perceived ‘western’ type state with
               clearly identifiable formal autonomy, that strives for a form of monopoly over violence,
               often taking the viability of such structures for granted [<a href="#R1">1</a>, <a href="#R2">2</a>]. However, many police missions face a confusing situation where existing state institutions
               take other forms and interact with other social structures. These social structures
               include clans, tribes, criminal groups, and armed insurgents involved in governance.
               In many cases, complex local context has hampered police missions, and the success
               rates of international missions are troublesome [<a href="#R3">3</a>, <a href="#R4">4</a>, <a href="#R5">5</a>, <a href="#R6">6</a>, <a href="#R7">7</a>, <a href="#R8">8</a>, <a href="#R9">9</a>, <a href="#R10">10</a>, <a href="#R11">11</a>, <a href="#R12">12</a>, <a href="#R13">13</a>, <a href="#R14">14</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e121">We should not expect the result of police institution building to mirror the state-controlled
               model prevalent amongst donors, as this also influences the tasks that become important
               for policing; after all, the key should be the quality of the police services provided
               given the resources available, rather than the structure of the institutions providing
               those services.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e123">This article argues that a tool from the risk management sector known as scenario
               planning, can be used to avoid several of these problems. Chris Ruggeri, national
               managing principal of Deloitte Risk and Financial Advisory, argues that “scenario
               planning helps the organization embrace uncertainty by developing data-driven stories
               about the future that can generate more informed decisions” [<a href="#R15">15</a>]. Scenarios are here prepared for deployment under different types of circumstances,
               in the case of police operations, related to variations over the type of state control
               in question. Subsequently, such scenarios can help to systematize our understanding
               of situations where state institutions lack importance, and where personal networks
               are more important.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e128">This article will ask how variations in state territorial control influenced police
               missions in the past, and then develop four scenarios that can enable foreign-backed
               police missions to adopt to such circumstances. It will first observe the experiences
               of police missions after the start of the war on terror in 2001, then discuss the
               problems they have faced, and finally construct four general scenarios and their policy
               implications. In order to do this, the article draws upon Hansen’s 2017/2019 work
               on the relationship between jihadist organizations and territorial control, changing
               and adapting it to policing [<a href="#R16">16</a>, <a href="#R17">17</a>]. It does this to build upon Hansen’s typology to offer scenarios as a basis for
               developing policy interventions.

            <p id="d1e139">Since 2001, efforts to create or build police institutions have encountered large
               problems. In Afghanistan, the first plans to (re)create a police force emerged after
               the G8 Meeting in Geneva in 2002, through a plan for security sector reform (SSR).
               It established a state monopoly of violence, and a more state-centric approach to
               Afghan policing where the police forces were to be centrally controlled [<a href="#R18">18</a>]. This model was abandoned, as foreign donors understood that the model was ill-suited
               to the conflict system of Afghanistan, where traditional tribal institutions and armed
               groups had traditions for implementing justice even before the Afghan Civil War. This
               model was based on specific assumptions, one of which according to Paris (2004) is
               that the state has to monopolize coercive power before enforcing the rule of law [<a href="#R19">19</a>]. Lawrence (2012) presents the challenges of a state-centric approach to security
               sector reform in fragile and post conflict areas, stating that the resources available
               to establish new institutions and sustain them are often not available, as they are
               higher than the host state’s revenue and the donor’s will to support them [<a href="#R20">20</a>]. In many cases, newly established institutions ended up lacking legitimacy, as the
               local populations simply continued to rely upon other justice providers from the past
               civil war. In Afghanistan, the prewar state had always delegated justice and law functions
               to non-state actors in the countryside [<a href="#R21">21</a>]. Donors were also unprepared for several of the other conditions that they encountered
               - for example, the first attempts to create police forces involved the re-deployment
               of individual policemen to villages without oversight, monitoring, or assistance mechanisms
               [<a href="#R22">22</a>]. There was a grey zone between policing, counter-insurgency, and institution building,
               and institutions were not always designed for the relevant situation. At times, police
               forces became synonymous with forces doing counterinsurgency and were too lightly
               armed and too numerically weak at a local level to survive the pressure from non-state
               armed groups; at other times, police forces were hijacked by local power-holders [<a href="#R23">23</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e160">Interestingly, the conditions in Afghanistan had parallels with situations in other
               countries. In Somalia, policing was seen as a key element in building the new Somali
               state, and the approach was state-centric from the start [<a href="#R24">24</a>]. Moreover, Somalia saw tension resulting from police forces expanding into regions
               with a presence of jihadist groups. Due to police acting as support troops for African
               Union offensives, the border between being police and being a soldier was unclear
               [<a href="#R25">25</a>]. In Southern Somalia, a problem occurred when the Somali government and the UNDP
               planned to create rural police forces; they were found to be too lightly armed to
               be able to survive [<a href="#R24">24</a>]. The police force also had to navigate a society where it faced rival social structures,
               organizations which implemented justice functions (often better than the police),
               and areas with tensions and distrust between regional states and the federal state
               [<a href="#R9">9</a>, <a href="#R26">26</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e177">In Mali, the EU civilian mission in Mali (EUCAP MALI), was launched in January 2015
               with a two-year mandate tasked with improving the operational efficiency of the national
               police [<a href="#R27">27</a>]. The police mission was skeptical of expanding into the northern countryside because
               the area was seen as too insecure for policing [<a href="#R28">28</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e185">In Iraq, the police were originally trained for a community-policing role with light
               side arms and light vehicles, but the general lack of security led to them facing
               insurgents, and suffering heavy losses from 2004-2006 [<a href="#R26">26</a>]. Subsequently, heavier police commando units were created after the model of American
               SWAT forces with more emphasis on combat operations, but these failed in achieving
               trust from the community [<a href="#R28">28</a>, <a href="#R29">29</a>, <a href="#R30">30</a>, <a href="#R31">31</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e202">The common denominator of all of these experiences was summed up by David Bayley and
               Pobert Perito; “in mission after mission … training programs have been put in place
               like canned food that is assumed to be universally nourishing. In complex environments,
               however, one size doesn’t fit all” [<a href="#R32">32</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e207">State centralism, paired with an underlying assumption that the state had a monopoly
               of coercive power, often characterized the initial stages of security sector reform.
               Police reformers were unprepared for the fact that they faced alternative, and often
               rivaling justice providers. Scholars such as Ebo (2007), Baker (2010), Sky (2006),
               Andersen (2011) underlined the errors of such assumptions, stressing the need for
               working with state traditions and local conditions, suggesting a hybrid approach,
               rather than a state-centric approach [<a href="#R33">33</a>, <a href="#R34">34</a>, <a href="#R35">35</a>, <a href="#R36">36</a>]. Donais (2017) stressed that non-state justice providers, although fluctuating in
               power, had proven to be more stable than often perceived, making it harder to challenge
               or circumvent them. Despite increased critique from theorists, the implementation
               of security sector reform generally remained state-centric [<a href="#R37">37</a>]. Moreover, even critics ignored important types of cases facing policy reformers
               in the field, such as what to do with non-state governed enclaves who were doing policing,
               as was the case in Somaliland in the Horn of Africa.
               
            </p>
            <p id="d1e224">When more hybrid models were deployed they also faced problems, frequently experiencing
               capture by local strongmen or criminal groups that were in control of central state
               institutions; implementing transparency and the rule of law also remained a problem.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e226">The academic discussion thus had several gaps: the state as an endpoint was kept as
               an assumption, the practical programs failed to explore state capture by criminal
               groups, and there was a failure to assess the impact of local strongmen. The question
               of what the state controlled, and if criminal groups could capture state institutions
               were central in understanding the above failures, and in understanding the state’s
               presence in the territories they de-jure should control, as well as the presence of
               other groups within state institutions.

               <!-- named anchor --></a><h2 class="main-title">3.- Introducing Territorial Presence</h2>
            <p id="d1e231">As reported by Matthew Schwartz, newly created or adapted police forces in many places
               face other networks that perform de-facto policing, such as clans, family networks
               and tribes [<a href="#R38">38</a>]. Denny, for example, sees community police structures as varying according to state
               involvement, at times taking advantage of non-state actors, and at times operating
               in areas where the state is weak [<a href="#R39">39</a>]. In some settings, a central state leadership may even accept police-like governance
               structures from various agents, tribes, militias, private military corporations and
               even criminal networks [<a href="#R40">40</a>]. Supporters and facilitators of security sector and police reform still tend to
               expect a typical configuration of a state, often reassembling the structures found
               in states such as the United States, France, and China. It is often forgotten that
               these type of states and state institutions are a rather new invention; China, for
               example, has large problems with disciplining and controlling its own institutions
               as recently as the 1980s, and has had unclear borders between police actors and criminal
               cartels [<a href="#R10">10</a>, <a href="#R41">41</a>]. Re-establishing police services in post-conflict situations means that one must
               deal with a state that at times does not follows the standard expectation of what
               a state is today. In some states, the elite establishes a neo-patrimonial system to
               stay in power, not necessarily to create state institutions, but to further their
               own interests, with little care for the general population [<a href="#R40">40</a>, <a href="#R42">42</a>, <a href="#R43">43</a>]. The borders between state and criminal groups might be unclear and blurred, and
               in some cases, criminal groups might even be a part of this system of governance [<a href="#R44">44</a>, <a href="#R45">45</a>, <a href="#R46">46</a>, <a href="#R47">47</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e271">At times, the state might retract itself completely from parts of a country. This
               can be a way of saving money for increasing the profit for a ruling elite, for restricted
               resources, saving lives, or gaining political support, or could be a result of casualty
               sensitivity. It should not be forgotten that the West also employs similar strategies;
               in Iraq, the withdrawal of the Occupational Forces into fortified and relatively isolated
               camps was a product of American strategy in the period from 2003-2006 [<a href="#R48">48</a>, <a href="#R49">49</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e279">Even if the state is rich, its peripheral areas can also be very poorly controlled
               because of geographical features that can make policing costly. For example, a rich
               country like Norway is unable to properly investigate illegal fishing around its Bovet
               Island in the South Atlantic, despite the belief amongst experts that this type of
               crime is extensive in the area [<a href="#R50">50</a>]. Norway has simply chosen to retract from the area, save infrequent visits (less
               than once every two years) by its Navy. In the Malian case, the Mali-Algerian border
               has few people living in the border areas, generating little income [<a href="#R51">51</a>, <a href="#R52">52</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e290">The income required to provide more control is at times unobtainable, or too large
               for a state to prioritize. Territorial control might thus vary, and the way that the
               state retracts its borders with the society around it might be unclear, with parallel
               channels of governance outside the formal state institutions. In essence, the state
               could have a limited presence amongst its civilian population, despite being militarily
               strong.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e292">How can one systematize thinking around what kind of presence the government wields
               in new areas where police forces are to be created? A suitable model has to consider
               the practical effects of government withdrawal, if this is the case. Such withdrawal
               can be voluntary, even to the extent that a central government or an occupying force
               has control if it chooses to and cannot be beaten in open battles, but still chooses
               to restrict its presence. In some cases, the government might even face an enclave
               with an ‘anti-state’ and an organization that protests the government’s right to rule,
               that has established control and produces governance [<a href="#R53">53</a>, <a href="#R54">54</a>, <a href="#R55">55</a>, <a href="#R56">56</a>, <a href="#R57">57</a>, <a href="#R58">58</a>, <a href="#R59">59</a>]. A good model also has to take into consideration that the government might delegate
               responsibility to criminal groups to handle issues of governance, or be integrated
               into the elite at the top of the state.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e316">Hansen (2017;2019) studies a form of violent actors, violent jihadist organizations
               and religiously inspired organizations using violence to achieve their targets [<a href="#R16">16</a>, <a href="#R17">17</a>]. While these actors are different from internationally recognized states, Hansen’s
               model focuses on the relationship between these organizations and territorial control.
               He argues that these organizations might be accommodated by a state, might exist secretly
               in areas which the state control, or might be left with vital governance functions
               in areas where the state neglects the provision of human security to its locals or
               has full territorial control. This model avoids seeing territory and territorial control
               as being static, and rather acknowledges it as produced and reproduced, through the
               very practices of the state and other actors that are discussed in this article. In
               this view, it is a product of practices existing a priory, yet it also leads to certain
               conditions and practices that are of relevance to policing. This model acknowledges
               the concept of territoriality might change and is influenced by the interaction of
               the relevant actors, yet it also acknowledges that a specific type of territoriality
               entails a specific set of practices. Following Stuart Elden, territoriality and territory
               can be understood as being techniques for measuring land and controlling terrain,
               it becomes a political technology [<a href="#R60">60</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e327">Hansen’s model seems suited to explore transformations of insurgency groups rather
               than sketching up scenarios for policing, yet it holds some important insights that
               can be developed further. Ultimately, the level of security a regime can implement
               in territories under its theoretical jurisdiction influences territorial control.
               This control is also influenced by the government’s use of non-government agents in
               their attempts to do governance, and the type of agents they use. These factors might
               similarly influence policing, changing the context of the police operation from a
               good security situation, where the police deal with familiar institutions within a
               state structure, to a situation where the government either is too weak or absent
               to provide security, and/or relies on non-state groups as agents performing governance.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e329">Hansen bases his model on four scenarios, sketching out variations over the relationship
               between the violent jihadist organization and the territory in which it operates.
               In the first scenario, the state allows such an organization to operate and, in many
               cases, uses it for governance purposes. Al Qaeda, for example, served as trainers
               for militant groups supported by Sudan during their Sudan years [<a href="#R17">17</a>]. In one sense, this scenario mirrors another in which a new police force faces criminal
               forces integrated with the state it is supposed to serve. In order to draw out the
               implications for policing, the focus in the scenario has to be slightly modified to
               a scenario where non-state (and sometimes criminal) actors are performing governance
               functions. The government in question will employ non-state armed groups; government
               willingness to cooperate with such groups means that the border between state institutions
               and non-state institutions has become blurred. In some such cases, crime has been
               integrated into the government structure and government leaders might be directly
               involved in crime. Its acceptance by the elite makes policing extremely difficult,
               not unlike in the state of Chicago in the 1930s [<a href="#R61">61</a>]. In Kenya, in 2007, several youth gangs, including the infamous Mungiki and also
               the less known Taliban youth gang (not to be confused with the Taliban of Afghanistan),
               were used by politicians in the struggle leading up to the elections [<a href="#R62">62</a>]. In his classic book on Warlordism, William Reno sketches out how patrimonialism
               networks branched into criminal networks in West Africa in the 1990s [<a href="#R63">63</a>]. He also describes how informal networks outside the state are more important for
               many state leaders than the formal institutions of the state; in these cases, crime
               might be imbedded with the state itself. In order to adapt the scenario here, we might
               refer to it as the <b>crime/state governance assemblage</b> scenario.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e346">A second model, referred to as <b>
                  <i>the ‘state control’ scenario</i>
                  </b>, focuses on the situation faced by policing in Europe, North America, Oceania and
               East Asia, where the state controls violence through its security institutions, including
               police structures. In these cases, violent jihadists exist as clandestine networks,
               are afraid of being investigated, and are focused on organizational security. State
               institutions dominate the provision of law and order, making this is the ideal type
               of the ‘modern state’, and the goal that many police reforms and many new police forces
               attempt to achieve [<a href="#R40">40</a>]. Importantly, it often seems to be an end target for attempts to construct and re-construct
               new police forces; the problem is that there are large parts of the world where the
               ‘state control’ scenario has never been applied historically, with some areas being
               hampered by geography, lack of income, and relatively strong alternatives.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e357">Hansen introduces a third scenario, ‘semi-territoriality’, where a state has yielded
               control by retracting itself; the state, or an international occupying force, focuses
               on security concerns for its troops by sheltering them in bases, and apart from the
               odd government campaign, has little (if any) presence at the local level. A Yemeni
               friend of the writer perfectly described this scenario, commenting on pre-war Yemen,
               claiming, “Yemen is a post office in Sanaa [Yemen’s capital] where I get my passport
               when I travel abroad, otherwise I don’t see ‘Yemen’ anywhere [<a href="#R64">64</a>]. In the original scenario, violent jihadist organizations were allowed advantages,
               as locals had to relate to them; the violent jihadists would come back when the government
               pulled back their forces after intermittent campaigns. These campaigns would function
               like a child squeezing a balloon without ripping it: if you squeeze the insurgents
               one place, they will flow into another sparsely controlled area, then come back when
               the government had left. This meant that locals had to adjust to the violent insurgency
               groups; similarly, a state of semi-territoriality means that locals have to adjust
               to living with other armed groups than the ones loyal to the state. In such cases,
               security and justice provision are at times dependent on armed groups in opposition
               to the state.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e363">Such a situation leads to forms of hedging techniques on behalf of the locals, where
               actors with semi-territorial power have to be accommodated if locals want to stay
               safe. There are many strategies to achieve this: locals might integrate into groups,
               try to get their sons or daughters to participate in group activities, or even seek
               to gain leadership positions. Supplying recruits for armed militias, supplying brides
               in marriage or paying protection money (tax) might be additional approaches. Local
               support for state institutions is weakly manifested in these cases, where the state
               does not have a strong enough presence to protect the loyalists, leaving them at the
               mercy of hostile armed groups. This happened in Iraq during the first part of the
               insurgency, where tribal allies of the occupation forces were left to themselves [<a href="#R48">48</a>]. The Somali examples illustrate a similar situation, where clans had to interact
               and even integrate into the Shabaab in order to survive, and there was little support
               from the government or the forces of the African Union [<a href="#R65">65</a>]. The paradox is that these areas are under the military control of the state, and
               the opposing armed groups do not have the means to defeat the state in open battle,
               yet the state has retracted from providing day-to-day security.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e371">Returning to Hansen’s ideal types, a last scenario describes a case where an insurgency
               organization is setting up institutions of governance in an area that is under their
               relatively permanent territorial control. In such a scenario, an organization hostile
               to the state will perform governance, often including police services. For the purpose
               of this article, one might expand it from a violent jihadist organization, to including
               any type of insurgency/cessation organization controlling territory on a more permanent
               basis, an example being Somaliland in Somalia, or even Ossetia or the trans-Dniester
               republic in Moldova [<a href="#R66">66</a>, <a href="#R67">67</a>]. Rebel-created governance structures in enclaves can be relatively permanent, and
               can bring forms of stability as well as policing to a local population. This is not
               always the case, and might depend on historical conditions, traditions and the stability
               of rebel control [<a href="#R68">68</a>]. In this case, it would be the rebels that do govern the local population, even
               when they have limited governance institutions, predictability and stability depend
               on them.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e382">We now have four ideal types based on Hansen (2017/2019), which have been slightly
               altered for the study of police operations and will be outlined. Under certain circumstances,
               newly created police forces will face a <b>
                  <i>state/crime assemblage scenario</i>
                  </b>, where crime and state will be intertwined, and where criminal groups have been used
               for governance purposes. However, under other conditions, a newly created police force
               might face a state where parallel state institutions are managing to uphold a monopoly
               of violence; this is reminiscent of the typical situation in North America, North
               Asia and Europe, which can be called a <b>
                  <i>‘state controlled’ scenario</i>
                  </b>, where state institutions have the power to define police reform structures due to
               their position in the international aid and security landscape. In a third and very
               different scenario known as the <b>
                  <i>semi-territorial scenario</i>
                  </b>, the state has withdrawn from the day to day dealings in a region, although entering
               into it in on an irregular basis and wielding superior forces when doing so. The final
               scenario named <b>
                  <i>the enclave scenario</i>
                  </b>, is where the state has fully given up control over an area lacks reach, and is in
               many ways irrelevant, as an alternative structure is performing governance. For the
               purpose of this article, such a scenario might be named <b>
                  <i>the enclave scenario</i>
                  </b>. In the original model, Hansen stresses that several of these four scenarios can
               co-exist within a state: for instance, in some cases, a part of the de jure state
               can have a state-controlled scenario in the capital city, but have an enclave inside
               its de-jure territories, as well as lacking a permanent presence in other areas, while
               working in league with governance networks in other regions.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e414">As will be shown, these scenarios demand different structures in the development efficient
               solutions to policing. The model can say something about the conditions in which police
               operate under and its variations, and perhaps more clearly underline the particular
               necessities for policing in each case.
            </p>

         <div class="section"><a id="s4">
               <!-- named anchor --></a><h2 class="main-title">4.- The State/Crime Assemblage Scenario</h2>
            <p id="d1e419">When doing research in Kenya for the EU-financed Horizon 2020 policing project, one
               reoccurring criticism from several interviews with the United Nations UNODC and UNDP
               programs was that these programs were ‘policy blind’ [<a href="#R69">69</a>]. The political strata was seen to be unwilling to discard criminal practices and
               criminal connections, instead leaving police reform as an exercise in fulfilling bureaucratic
               checkpoints. The NGOs underlined that the ability to handle crime becomes less important
               if one lacks the will, partly due to the involvement of elites in criminal activities.
               In one sense, the comments point to one of the essential features of this scenario,
               namely the lack of will to handle criminal networks despite having the resources to
               do so [<a href="#R70">70</a>]. Police reform quickly becomes merely an exercise for organizations to attempt to
               follow a list of benchmarks without understanding the situation; such material capacity
               building doesn’t necessarily transform into better policing. Attempts to use a standard
               set of strategies employed in East Asia, Europe, North Asia, Oceania or North America,
               might be counterproductive and even dangerous to policing, as the institutions and
               structures vary considerably.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e427">To venture into a state-to-state-bilateral support program, or indeed a United Nations/regional
               organization to state program, becomes a dangerous step where checks and balances
               become essential. To read and understand the local situation becomes essential, requiring
               a broad dialogue locally, as well as particular understanding of the links between
               the police and the criminal networks, the networks doing governance, which non-state
               networks that are important, and the interaction between formal institutions and informal
               channels. In this scenario, information triangulation becomes very important, and
               a proper mapping of the
            </p>
            <p id="d1e429">informal institutions that are important for the governance, and the legality of these
               institutions according to national and international law is essential.
               There are a number of potential key allies in police reform: for example, human rights
               groups could be act as a check on the police forces, while state institutions that
               are ‘cleaner’ (even cadre units within the police itself, isolated from the rest of
               the police forces) can be expanded and supported. Religious leaders with integrity
               could also be allies, as could journalists. In such situations, it is important to
               remember that the institutions with the ability to perform checks and balances in
               relation to the police could be in danger of facing violence from the police or allied
               gangs, although international pressure and international exposure might give some
               protection to such institutions. In order to achieve all of this, it is necessary
               to have a permanent and robust presence on the ground for international NGOs and other
               entities involved in police reform. Such presence becomes important in obtaining firsthand
               knowledge of the economic links and network links between individuals within the police,
               the government, various criminal groups, non-state commercial actors.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e431">The State/crime assemblage must be understood and the links and economic incentives
               sustaining them must be disentangled. To do so enables actors involved in police reform
               to block negative economic incentives, or to alter them in support of a police force
               disentangled from criminal groups and clientism. A paradox in this situation is that
               a general increase in police payment might alleviate some of the problems facing the
               police forces, as policemen become less dependent on criminal activities for income
               generation. If checks and balances fail to be implemented, international engagement
               might actually aid the buildup of criminal groups.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e433">Last but not least, a scenario might entail political reform or even political change
               - these situations have scared away international donors in the past. Political change
               is sensitive, can be seen as undue foreign interference in domestic politics and can
               lead to sanctions from the local political elite. Moreover, material support for the
               police forces can disappear in corruption or end with criminal groups [<a href="#R71">71</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e438">While this scenario is challenging, an approach that includes focus on political reform
               and checks and balances on the police forces, with emphasis on understanding local
               conditions, might enhance the probabilities for success. Most importantly, international
               police reformers must understand that countermeasures may be necessary in such an
               environment, and be willing to implement countermeasures, even when it means challenges
               from local political elites. Strengthening policing includes pressure for political
               change and making important decisions over whether parallel governance systems should
               be included in efficient policing or be dismantled or detached from governance.

               <!-- named anchor --></a><h2 class="main-title">5.- The State-Controlled Scenario</h2>
            <p id="d1e443">A more common approach focusing on the state as the security provider, as it was conducted
               in Bosnia, might serve well in such a scenario [<a href="#R72">72</a>]. There will be pitfalls as local authoritarian traditions can create human rights
               violations, as well as a lack of contact between the police and the local communities.
               However, many of the experiences of common donors will be highly relevant, as the
               scenario reassembles police reform work in Europe, North-East Asia, Oceania and North
               America, where most donors came from. This is closer to the one-size fits all approach
               that several governments have promoted in the past. Experiences from donor countries
               and their recent attempts on police reform can be employed [<a href="#R73">73</a>]. Checks and balances do matter, as do efforts to improve transparency inside the
               police forces’ attempts to improve community interaction.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e451">Although this type of scenario is common in the West, western examples demonstrate
               its shortcomings. For example, trust between police and communities becomes very important,
               to ensure proper communication and that communities in general feel protected; local
               understanding is very important in this sense [<a href="#R74">74</a>, <a href="#R75">75</a>, <a href="#R76">76</a>]. In the past, the lack of such communication, in many cases created by the lack
               of trust, and the absence of a map of large-scale connections and overlaps between
               the police and crime groups have hampered police work in Europe and United States
               [<a href="#R77">77</a>, <a href="#R78">78</a>, <a href="#R79">79</a>, <a href="#R80">80</a>]. Top-down reforms become easier to implement due to hierarchy, while centralized
               police reform becomes easier to implement as it centralizes the monopoly of violence.

               <!-- named anchor --></a><h2 class="main-title">6.- The Semi-Territorial Scenario</h2>
            <p id="d1e478">In parts of Somalia such as the rural areas in the Bay-Bakool area or central Mudug,
               or in southern Algeria, it is difficult to spot any state institutions. The state,
               police forces included, is absent, save the odd military campaign or patrols; for
               locals, the police either do not exist or exist on an ad hoc basis. The state has
               a solid presence in many of these areas in the form of strong military units that
               are superior to insurgency forces, but do not engage in policing and providing local
               security at a regular basis.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e480">Local power holders as insurgents become important providers of security, either by
               attempting to create some form of security services for locals, or through becoming
               the producers of insecurity that locals have to envisage strategies in order to appease.
               As previously mentioned, such strategies can include appeasement through providing
               recruits, tax, or wives to insurgent outfits, which allow locals to embed themselves
               into insurgent groups and avoid sanctions through the creation of networks and connections.
               Forced recruitment and marriage might also take place.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e482">In some cases, other more informal governance entities, such as clans or tribes, might
               provide some police/security functions and their own justice mechanisms. However,
               several of these mechanisms might have serious drawbacks when it comes to gender issues
               and human rights. This means that any police reform will face a set of challenges,
               the first and foremost being the lack of will and capacity to establish the state,
               including the police in these areas. In some cases, it might not be cost-effective
               for the state to deploy in the areas. In other cases, it might be costly in the short
               term, but cost-effective in the long term - for example, by denying guerilla movements
               on the ground so the state will need convincing before deploying resources. When the
               state builds up a presence, it cannot be done piecemeal, as insurgents and local power
               holders would have the power to fight off small police forces. In Somalia, for example,
               a plan for three to five person police forces in the countryside had to be abandoned
               because of fears that Shabaab units would crush the Somali police. In Iraq, lightly
               armed community police units faced the same problem [<a href="#R13">13</a>, <a href="#R24">24</a>]. Police forces in the initial stage must be equipped to defend themselves from heavy
               attacks (which hampers their investigative efforts), and have to look more like heavy
               armed militias in order to survive.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e490">Community contacts become important, as do the provision of police services to the
               locals. Local communities will most likely face severe deprecations if seen supporting
               new police forces before a secure environment is created, and thus hostility from
               the local communities, with severe reprisals against ethnic groups supporting the
               police becomes likely. Steps to protect local allies must be enhanced, and possible
               military units might be involved in creating a security environment more conducive
               to normal policing. Standardized police programs based on experiences and techniques
               from Europe, North Asia, North America and Oceania are less suited for this type of
               police reform, and counterinsurgency techniques focusing on protecting local populations
               and security forces must be given priority. Police units, also community police, have
               to be heavily coordinated with other security forces in order to receive quick reinforcements
               if needed, and have to have heavy armaments.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e492">Local allies, if supported and provided with ample security, can be valuable in upholding
               justice. Local clan mechanisms, for example, can be used to relieve the police of
               duties and to act as force multipliers. In the case of lack of state capacity or local
               legitimacy, such use of local clan mechanisms or community policing programs might
               become the only viable option in justice provision in the foreseeable future, and
               might have been so in the past. They might be the nucleus of a new policing regime
               that does not reassemble any Westphalian type of state and yet be the only realistic
               alternative. However, this solution has many drawbacks: for example, human rights
               shortcomings, in the form of discrimination against females or ethnic minorities,
               are in many ways entrenched in traditional governance systems as clans or tribal entities.
               Such problems have been addressed by dialogue in the past, and local structures can
               be flexible and possibly influenced through interaction with outsiders [<a href="#R81">81</a>]. Also, local allies often need to defend themselves and their institutions against
               insurgents and criminal groups; if this is not forthcoming, these allies might disappear
               when outside support is still needed.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e497">In such areas, efforts to create a secure environment conducive to policing should
               be prioritized over normal police duties. The scenario is simply not fit for ‘ordinary’
               police forces, something that must be considered when designing police forces for
               cases reassembling the traits of this scenario. In such zones, law and order and the
               sense of ordinary justice for the local population is essential. Violent organizations
               such as the Shabaab, the Lord’s Resistance Army and the Allied Democratic Forces have
               used such zones for survival and have staged large attacks out of them [<a href="#R16">16</a>, <a href="#R17">17</a>].
            </p>

         <div class="section"><a id="s7">
               <!-- named anchor --></a><h2 class="main-title">7.- The Enclave Scenario</h2>
            <p id="d1e508">The enclave scenario also brings large dilemmas to police reform, some of which are
               political. For instance, as when the Islamic State governed parts of Iraq and Syria,
               the local power holder might provide forms of justice and police services, but will
               transgress human rights and have aggressive goals [<a href="#R57">57</a>, <a href="#R58">58</a>, <a href="#R59">59</a>]. In such cases, an engagement in building up police forces or reforming police will
               be seriously hampered by hostility from potential donors. Moreover, the survival of
               the enclave could be in doubt. Local actors that are not accepted by a majority of
               international states can nevertheless adroitly provide police services to the local
               population, which could present a major dilemma is if such enclaves also should be
               a possible nucleus for creating local police forces. This presents a political question:
               is it state-building or the provision of police services that should be the priority?
               After all, an enclave might have a better system for provision of police services
               than the state it nominally is a part of. Supporting enclave policing based on the
               rebel faction in control might be the best way to provide services locally, but could
               counter-act state-building processes, and creating the appearance of taking sides
               in a civil war situation. This creates its own issues – often, the rebel ruler will
               also be unacceptable to the international community.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e519">This is similar to the problems between Somalia and the self-declared state of Somaliland,
               where the latter, although not internationally recognized, produces more extensive
               and better services (including policing). The Somaliland/Somalia situation has been
               largely solved by seeking the approval of the government of Somalia for projects implemented
               in Somaliland, and by standardizing equipment and education in projects targeting
               both the enclave, and forces outside of the enclave. In other instances, such as the
               Kurdish self-governed areas or in the case of pre-independence Kosovo, the West chose
               to back police reform: in the first case as a part of a more federal arrangement,
               but also as an acceptance that the lack of trust in Iraq made national policing in
               the Kurdish areas impossible.
               A secondary question arises in whether an enclave could be a part of a state-building
               effort? The power dynamics within international relations are a central force within
               this question, especially the consideration of which powers support the enclave and
               which powers support the state’s leadership. International politics will thus limit
               the possibilities for international engagement. However, it should be noted that engagement
               with enclaves might be highly useful - in the case of pre-independence Kosovo, the
               West chose to back police reform, in the first case as a part of a more federal arrangement,
               but also as an acceptance that the lack of trust. In Iraq, this strategy made national
               policing in the Kurdish areas impossible. In the second case, the purpose was to build
               up a new state. In Somalia, one also chose to engage Somaliland, despite the second
               entity lacking backing for independence [<a href="#R24">24</a>]. The Federal system in Somalia was to a certain extent based on enclave thinking,
               as the central government lacked the necessary trust to do large-scale policing in
               regional entities such as the Juba State and Puntland. The solution was found in creating
               both local police handled by the enclave, as well as a federal police structure handling
               border patrols and investigations in the capital, all while including weak mechanisms
               of centralization in the process. These mechanisms included common training sessions,
               common uniforms, etc [<a href="#R13">13</a>, <a href="#R24">24</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e530">When dealing with an enclave that is not aggressive and avoids substantial human rights
               violations, the question also turns political. Should human security and the service
               provision given to locals count more than vague dreams of future centralization and
               central state building? Can federalization be a tool to make police reform acceptable
               to international actors? Will police reform inside the enclave really undermine state
               building, when the central state lacks presence in the enclave anyway? Can the Somalia/Somaliland
               solution be a model in other cases? If the political issues are overcome, the police
               reform efforts might be efficient. Moreover, as illustrated in the above discussions,
               there are thus possible mechanisms that can promote the integration of the police
               forces from the enclave into a larger police force.

               <!-- named anchor --></a><h2 class="main-title">8.- Conclusions</h2>
            <p id="d1e535">It is easy to develop general practices for police reform which are seen as globally
               valid. However, research literature rightly suggests that local conditions must be
               taken into consideration when designing a police reform program. Additionally, reform
               must be open for a variety of intentions from the local elite, and it must be able
               to handle the level of violence taking place locally. Today, police forces in peacekeeping
               missions are required to undergo considerable training before they go into deployment,
               and UN organizations have developed common training programs [<a href="#R82">82</a>], such as the Standardized Generic Training Modules (SGTMs), the Core Pre-deployment
               Training Materials (CPTM) and the Specialized Training Materials (STMs). Although
               these programs are designed for peacekeeping and not for police reform (and therefore
               have an operational focus), they illustrate a lack of local adaptation.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e540">A typology as presented here can help police experts go beyond these standardized
               curriculums to understand that variations in context should influence the structure
               of a police reform or of new institutions. Additionally, the typology will enable
               individuals in the field to think systematically about variables that influence structure
               and training. The ideal type of scenarios will hopefully also serve as a point of
               departure for future discussions that might refine them.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e542">These scenarios serve as a useful reminder that police reform is influenced by both
               global and local politics, and that politics often must to be addressed in order to
               achieve successful results (yet actors such as the UN often shun away from this).
               It also highlights the uncomfortable fact that the local provision of basic human
               security and policing at times can be thwarted by or sacrificed for a larger state-building
               agenda, even where a centralized state might not have existed in the past. These scenarios
               remind us of the importance of taking the locals seriously, and seeing possibilities
               as well as challenges in local dynamics. To study variations over the territorial
               control variable might help in better understanding the local challenges faced by
               the police in many countries in the world, and to understand how these challenges
               can be met.
