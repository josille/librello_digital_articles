                                 missions in the recent past, and illustrate how recent police reforms were based on
                                 the structure of a ‘western’ type state with clearly identifiable formal state institutions
                                 enjoying autonomy, that strive for a form of territorial monopoly over violence. The
                                 article argues for moving beyond such assumptions by adopting scenarios based on how
                                 territory is controlled, developing four scenarios that can enable foreign-backed
                                 police missions to adapt to local circumstances. The article draws upon the typology
                                 of territorial control developed by Hansen in 2017/2019, amending this model to be
                                 adapted for policing. It argues that each of these scenarios require different strategies
                                 and compromises in order to create functioning police forces.</span></div>

                              <p id="d1e75">International guidelines for policing tend to put focus upon the state. This generally
                                 entails reconstructing institutions based on a perceived ‘western’ type state with
                                 clearly identifiable formal autonomy, that strives for a form of monopoly over violence,
                                 often taking the viability of such structures for granted [<a href="#R1">1</a>, <a href="#R2">2</a>]. However, many police missions face a confusing situation where existing state institutions
                                 take other forms and interact with other social structures. These social structures
                                 include clans, tribes, criminal groups, and armed insurgents involved in governance.
                                 In many cases, complex local context has hampered police missions, and the success
                                 rates of international missions are troublesome [<a href="#R3">3</a>, <a href="#R4">4</a>, <a href="#R5">5</a>, <a href="#R6">6</a>, <a href="#R7">7</a>, <a href="#R8">8</a>, <a href="#R9">9</a>, <a href="#R10">10</a>, <a href="#R11">11</a>, <a href="#R12">12</a>, <a href="#R13">13</a>, <a href="#R14">14</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e121">We should not expect the result of police institution building to mirror the state-controlled
                                 model prevalent amongst donors, as this also influences the tasks that become important
                                 for policing; after all, the key should be the quality of the police services provided
                                 given the resources available, rather than the structure of the institutions providing
                                 those services.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e123">This article argues that a tool from the risk management sector known as scenario
                                 planning, can be used to avoid several of these problems. Chris Ruggeri, national
                                 managing principal of Deloitte Risk and Financial Advisory, argues that “scenario
                                 planning helps the organization embrace uncertainty by developing data-driven stories
                                 about the future that can generate more informed decisions” [<a href="#R15">15</a>]. Scenarios are here prepared for deployment under different types of circumstances,
                                 in the case of police operations, related to variations over the type of state control
                                 in question. Subsequently, such scenarios can help to systematize our understanding
                                 of situations where state institutions lack importance, and where personal networks
                                 are more important.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e128">This article will ask how variations in state territorial control influenced police
                                 missions in the past, and then develop four scenarios that can enable foreign-backed
                                 police missions to adopt to such circumstances. It will first observe the experiences
                                 of police missions after the start of the war on terror in 2001, then discuss the
                                 problems they have faced, and finally construct four general scenarios and their policy
                                 implications. In order to do this, the article draws upon Hansen’s 2017/2019 work
                                 on the relationship between jihadist organizations and territorial control, changing
                                 and adapting it to policing [<a href="#R16">16</a>, <a href="#R17">17</a>]. It does this to build upon Hansen’s typology to offer scenarios as a basis for
                                 developing policy interventions.

                              <p id="d1e139">Since 2001, efforts to create or build police institutions have encountered large
                                 problems. In Afghanistan, the first plans to (re)create a police force emerged after
                                 the G8 Meeting in Geneva in 2002, through a plan for security sector reform (SSR).
                                 It established a state monopoly of violence, and a more state-centric approach to
                                 Afghan policing where the police forces were to be centrally controlled [<a href="#R18">18</a>]. This model was abandoned, as foreign donors understood that the model was ill-suited
                                 to the conflict system of Afghanistan, where traditional tribal institutions and armed
                                 groups had traditions for implementing justice even before the Afghan Civil War. This
                                 model was based on specific assumptions, one of which according to Paris (2004) is
                                 that the state has to monopolize coercive power before enforcing the rule of law [<a href="#R19">19</a>]. Lawrence (2012) presents the challenges of a state-centric approach to security
                                 sector reform in fragile and post conflict areas, stating that the resources available
                                 to establish new institutions and sustain them are often not available, as they are
                                 higher than the host state’s revenue and the donor’s will to support them [<a href="#R20">20</a>]. In many cases, newly established institutions ended up lacking legitimacy, as the
                                 local populations simply continued to rely upon other justice providers from the past
                                 civil war. In Afghanistan, the prewar state had always delegated justice and law functions
                                 to non-state actors in the countryside [<a href="#R21">21</a>]. Donors were also unprepared for several of the other conditions that they encountered
                                 - for example, the first attempts to create police forces involved the re-deployment
                                 of individual policemen to villages without oversight, monitoring, or assistance mechanisms
                                 [<a href="#R22">22</a>]. There was a grey zone between policing, counter-insurgency, and institution building,
                                 and institutions were not always designed for the relevant situation. At times, police
                                 forces became synonymous with forces doing counterinsurgency and were too lightly
                                 armed and too numerically weak at a local level to survive the pressure from non-state
                                 armed groups; at other times, police forces were hijacked by local power-holders [<a href="#R23">23</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e160">Interestingly, the conditions in Afghanistan had parallels with situations in other
                                 countries. In Somalia, policing was seen as a key element in building the new Somali
                                 state, and the approach was state-centric from the start [<a href="#R24">24</a>]. Moreover, Somalia saw tension resulting from police forces expanding into regions

                                 Union offensives, the border between being police and being a soldier was unclear

                                 be able to survive [<a href="#R24">24</a>]. The police force also had to navigate a society where it faced rival social structures,
                                 organizations which implemented justice functions (often better than the police),

                                 of coercive power, often characterized the initial stages of security sector reform.
                                 Police reformers were unprepared for the fact that they faced alternative, and often
                                 rivaling justice providers. Scholars such as Ebo (2007), Baker (2010), Sky (2006),
                                 Andersen (2011) underlined the errors of such assumptions, stressing the need for
                                 working with state traditions and local conditions, suggesting a hybrid approach,
                                 rather than a state-centric approach [<a href="#R33">33</a>, <a href="#R34">34</a>, <a href="#R35">35</a>, <a href="#R36">36</a>]. Donais (2017) stressed that non-state justice providers, although fluctuating in
                                 power, had proven to be more stable than often perceived, making it harder to challenge
                                 or circumvent them. Despite increased critique from theorists, the implementation
                                 of security sector reform generally remained state-centric [<a href="#R37">37</a>]. Moreover, even critics ignored important types of cases facing policy reformers
                                 in the field, such as what to do with non-state governed enclaves who were doing policing,
                                 as was the case in Somaliland in the Horn of Africa.

                                 capture by local strongmen or criminal groups that were in control of central state
                                 institutions; implementing transparency and the rule of law also remained a problem.

                                 groups, and there was a failure to assess the impact of local strongmen. The question
                                 of what the state controlled, and if criminal groups could capture state institutions
                                 were central in understanding the above failures, and in understanding the state’s
                                 presence in the territories they de-jure should control, as well as the presence of
                                 other groups within state institutions.

                              <p id="d1e231">As reported by Matthew Schwartz, newly created or adapted police forces in many places
                                 face other networks that perform de-facto policing, such as clans, family networks
                                 and tribes [<a href="#R38">38</a>]. Denny, for example, sees community police structures as varying according to state
                                 involvement, at times taking advantage of non-state actors, and at times operating
                                 in areas where the state is weak [<a href="#R39">39</a>]. In some settings, a central state leadership may even accept police-like governance
                                 structures from various agents, tribes, militias, private military corporations and
                                 even criminal networks [<a href="#R40">40</a>]. Supporters and facilitators of security sector and police reform still tend to
                                 expect a typical configuration of a state, often reassembling the structures found
                                 in states such as the United States, France, and China. It is often forgotten that
                                 these type of states and state institutions are a rather new invention; China, for
                                 example, has large problems with disciplining and controlling its own institutions
                                 as recently as the 1980s, and has had unclear borders between police actors and criminal
                                 cartels [<a href="#R10">10</a>, <a href="#R41">41</a>]. Re-establishing police services in post-conflict situations means that one must
                                 deal with a state that at times does not follows the standard expectation of what
                                 a state is today. In some states, the elite establishes a neo-patrimonial system to
                                 stay in power, not necessarily to create state institutions, but to further their
                                 own interests, with little care for the general population [<a href="#R40">40</a>, <a href="#R42">42</a>, <a href="#R43">43</a>]. The borders between state and criminal groups might be unclear and blurred, and
                                 in some cases, criminal groups might even be a part of this system of governance [<a href="#R44">44</a>, <a href="#R45">45</a>, <a href="#R46">46</a>, <a href="#R47">47</a>].

                              <p id="d1e271">At times, the state might retract itself completely from parts of a country. This
                                 can be a way of saving money for increasing the profit for a ruling elite, for restricted
                                 resources, saving lives, or gaining political support, or could be a result of casualty
                                 sensitivity. It should not be forgotten that the West also employs similar strategies;
                                 in Iraq, the withdrawal of the Occupational Forces into fortified and relatively isolated
                                 camps was a product of American strategy in the period from 2003-2006 [<a href="#R48">48</a>, <a href="#R49">49</a>].

                              <p id="d1e279">Even if the state is rich, its peripheral areas can also be very poorly controlled
                                 because of geographical features that can make policing costly. For example, a rich
                                 country like Norway is unable to properly investigate illegal fishing around its Bovet
                                 Island in the South Atlantic, despite the belief amongst experts that this type of
                                 crime is extensive in the area [<a href="#R50">50</a>]. Norway has simply chosen to retract from the area, save infrequent visits (less
                                 than once every two years) by its Navy. In the Malian case, the Mali-Algerian border
                                 has few people living in the border areas, generating little income [<a href="#R51">51</a>, <a href="#R52">52</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e290">The income required to provide more control is at times unobtainable, or too large
                                 for a state to prioritize. Territorial control might thus vary, and the way that the
                                 state retracts its borders with the society around it might be unclear, with parallel
                                 channels of governance outside the formal state institutions. In essence, the state
                                 could have a limited presence amongst its civilian population, despite being militarily
                                 strong.

                              <p id="d1e292">How can one systematize thinking around what kind of presence the government wields
                                 in new areas where police forces are to be created? A suitable model has to consider
                                 the practical effects of government withdrawal, if this is the case. Such withdrawal
                                 can be voluntary, even to the extent that a central government or an occupying force
                                 has control if it chooses to and cannot be beaten in open battles, but still chooses
                                 to restrict its presence. In some cases, the government might even face an enclave
                                 with an ‘anti-state’ and an organization that protests the government’s right to rule,
                                 that has established control and produces governance [<a href="#R53">53</a>, <a href="#R54">54</a>, <a href="#R55">55</a>, <a href="#R56">56</a>, <a href="#R57">57</a>, <a href="#R58">58</a>, <a href="#R59">59</a>]. A good model also has to take into consideration that the government might delegate
                                 responsibility to criminal groups to handle issues of governance, or be integrated
                                 into the elite at the top of the state.

                              <p id="d1e316">Hansen (2017;2019) studies a form of violent actors, violent jihadist organizations
                                 and religiously inspired organizations using violence to achieve their targets [<a href="#R16">16</a>, <a href="#R17">17</a>]. While these actors are different from internationally recognized states, Hansen’s
                                 model focuses on the relationship between these organizations and territorial control.
                                 He argues that these organizations might be accommodated by a state, might exist secretly
                                 in areas which the state control, or might be left with vital governance functions
                                 in areas where the state neglects the provision of human security to its locals or
                                 has full territorial control. This model avoids seeing territory and territorial control
                                 as being static, and rather acknowledges it as produced and reproduced, through the
                                 very practices of the state and other actors that are discussed in this article. In
                                 this view, it is a product of practices existing a priory, yet it also leads to certain
                                 conditions and practices that are of relevance to policing. This model acknowledges
                                 the concept of territoriality might change and is influenced by the interaction of
                                 the relevant actors, yet it also acknowledges that a specific type of territoriality
                                 entails a specific set of practices. Following Stuart Elden, territoriality and territory
                                 can be understood as being techniques for measuring land and controlling terrain,
                                 it becomes a political technology [<a href="#R60">60</a>].

                              <p id="d1e327">Hansen’s model seems suited to explore transformations of insurgency groups rather
                                 than sketching up scenarios for policing, yet it holds some important insights that
                                 can be developed further. Ultimately, the level of security a regime can implement
                                 in territories under its theoretical jurisdiction influences territorial control.
                                 This control is also influenced by the government’s use of non-government agents in
                                 their attempts to do governance, and the type of agents they use. These factors might
                                 similarly influence policing, changing the context of the police operation from a
                                 good security situation, where the police deal with familiar institutions within a
                                 state structure, to a situation where the government either is too weak or absent
                                 to provide security, and/or relies on non-state groups as agents performing governance.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e329">Hansen bases his model on four scenarios, sketching out variations over the relationship
                                 between the violent jihadist organization and the territory in which it operates.
                                 In the first scenario, the state allows such an organization to operate and, in many
                                 cases, uses it for governance purposes. Al Qaeda, for example, served as trainers
                                 for militant groups supported by Sudan during their Sudan years [<a href="#R17">17</a>]. In one sense, this scenario mirrors another in which a new police force faces criminal
                                 forces integrated with the state it is supposed to serve. In order to draw out the
                                 implications for policing, the focus in the scenario has to be slightly modified to
                                 a scenario where non-state (and sometimes criminal) actors are performing governance
                                 functions. The government in question will employ non-state armed groups; government
                                 willingness to cooperate with such groups means that the border between state institutions
                                 and non-state institutions has become blurred. In some such cases, crime has been
                                 integrated into the government structure and government leaders might be directly
                                 involved in crime. Its acceptance by the elite makes policing extremely difficult,
                                 not unlike in the state of Chicago in the 1930s [<a href="#R61">61</a>]. In Kenya, in 2007, several youth gangs, including the infamous Mungiki and also
                                 the less known Taliban youth gang (not to be confused with the Taliban of Afghanistan),
                                 were used by politicians in the struggle leading up to the elections [<a href="#R62">62</a>]. In his classic book on Warlordism, William Reno sketches out how patrimonialism
                                 networks branched into criminal networks in West Africa in the 1990s [<a href="#R63">63</a>]. He also describes how informal networks outside the state are more important for
                                 many state leaders than the formal institutions of the state; in these cases, crime
                                 might be imbedded with the state itself. In order to adapt the scenario here, we might
                                 refer to it as the <b>crime/state governance assemblage</b> scenario.

                              <p id="d1e346">A second model, referred to as <b>
                                    <i>the ‘state control’ scenario</i>
                                    </b>, focuses on the situation faced by policing in Europe, North America, Oceania and
                                 East Asia, where the state controls violence through its security institutions, including
                                 police structures. In these cases, violent jihadists exist as clandestine networks,
                                 are afraid of being investigated, and are focused on organizational security. State
                                 institutions dominate the provision of law and order, making this is the ideal type
                                 of the ‘modern state’, and the goal that many police reforms and many new police forces
                                 attempt to achieve [<a href="#R40">40</a>]. Importantly, it often seems to be an end target for attempts to construct and re-construct
                                 new police forces; the problem is that there are large parts of the world where the
                                 ‘state control’ scenario has never been applied historically, with some areas being
                                 hampered by geography, lack of income, and relatively strong alternatives.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e357">Hansen introduces a third scenario, ‘semi-territoriality’, where a state has yielded
                                 control by retracting itself; the state, or an international occupying force, focuses
                                 on security concerns for its troops by sheltering them in bases, and apart from the
                                 odd government campaign, has little (if any) presence at the local level. A Yemeni
                                 friend of the writer perfectly described this scenario, commenting on pre-war Yemen,
                                 claiming, “Yemen is a post office in Sanaa [Yemen’s capital] where I get my passport
                                 when I travel abroad, otherwise I don’t see ‘Yemen’ anywhere [<a href="#R64">64</a>]. In the original scenario, violent jihadist organizations were allowed advantages,
                                 as locals had to relate to them; the violent jihadists would come back when the government
                                 pulled back their forces after intermittent campaigns. These campaigns would function
                                 like a child squeezing a balloon without ripping it: if you squeeze the insurgents
                                 one place, they will flow into another sparsely controlled area, then come back when
                                 the government had left. This meant that locals had to adjust to the violent insurgency
                                 groups; similarly, a state of semi-territoriality means that locals have to adjust
                                 to living with other armed groups than the ones loyal to the state. In such cases,
                                 security and justice provision are at times dependent on armed groups in opposition
                                 to the state.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e363">Such a situation leads to forms of hedging techniques on behalf of the locals, where
                                 actors with semi-territorial power have to be accommodated if locals want to stay
                                 safe. There are many strategies to achieve this: locals might integrate into groups,
                                 try to get their sons or daughters to participate in group activities, or even seek
                                 to gain leadership positions. Supplying recruits for armed militias, supplying brides
                                 in marriage or paying protection money (tax) might be additional approaches. Local
                                 support for state institutions is weakly manifested in these cases, where the state
                                 does not have a strong enough presence to protect the loyalists, leaving them at the
                                 mercy of hostile armed groups. This happened in Iraq during the first part of the
                                 insurgency, where tribal allies of the occupation forces were left to themselves [<a href="#R48">48</a>]. The Somali examples illustrate a similar situation, where clans had to interact
                                 and even integrate into the Shabaab in order to survive, and there was little support
                                 from the government or the forces of the African Union [<a href="#R65">65</a>]. The paradox is that these areas are under the military control of the state, and
                                 the opposing armed groups do not have the means to defeat the state in open battle,
                                 yet the state has retracted from providing day-to-day security.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e371">Returning to Hansen’s ideal types, a last scenario describes a case where an insurgency
                                 organization is setting up institutions of governance in an area that is under their
                                 relatively permanent territorial control. In such a scenario, an organization hostile
                                 to the state will perform governance, often including police services. For the purpose
                                 of this article, one might expand it from a violent jihadist organization, to including
                                 any type of insurgency/cessation organization controlling territory on a more permanent
                                 basis, an example being Somaliland in Somalia, or even Ossetia or the trans-Dniester
                                 republic in Moldova [<a href="#R66">66</a>, <a href="#R67">67</a>]. Rebel-created governance structures in enclaves can be relatively permanent, and
                                 can bring forms of stability as well as policing to a local population. This is not
                                 always the case, and might depend on historical conditions, traditions and the stability
                                 of rebel control [<a href="#R68">68</a>]. In this case, it would be the rebels that do govern the local population, even
                                 when they have limited governance institutions, predictability and stability depend
                                 on them.

                              <p id="d1e382">We now have four ideal types based on Hansen (2017/2019), which have been slightly
                                 altered for the study of police operations and will be outlined. Under certain circumstances,
                                 newly created police forces will face a <b>
                                    <i>state/crime assemblage scenario</i>
                                    </b>, where crime and state will be intertwined, and where criminal groups have been used
                                 for governance purposes. However, under other conditions, a newly created police force
                                 might face a state where parallel state institutions are managing to uphold a monopoly
                                 of violence; this is reminiscent of the typical situation in North America, North
                                 Asia and Europe, which can be called a <b>
                                    <i>‘state controlled’ scenario</i>
                                    </b>, where state institutions have the power to define police reform structures due to
                                 their position in the international aid and security landscape. In a third and very
                                 different scenario known as the <b>
                                    <i>semi-territorial scenario</i>
                                    </b>, the state has withdrawn from the day to day dealings in a region, although entering
                                 into it in on an irregular basis and wielding superior forces when doing so. The final
                                 scenario named <b>
                                    <i>the enclave scenario</i>
                                    </b>, is where the state has fully given up control over an area lacks reach, and is in
                                 many ways irrelevant, as an alternative structure is performing governance. For the
                                 purpose of this article, such a scenario might be named <b>
                                    <i>the enclave scenario</i>
                                    </b>. In the original model, Hansen stresses that several of these four scenarios can
                                 co-exist within a state: for instance, in some cases, a part of the de jure state
                                 can have a state-controlled scenario in the capital city, but have an enclave inside
                                 its de-jure territories, as well as lacking a permanent presence in other areas, while
                                 working in league with governance networks in other regions.

                              <p id="d1e414">As will be shown, these scenarios demand different structures in the development efficient
                                 solutions to policing. The model can say something about the conditions in which police
                                 operate under and its variations, and perhaps more clearly underline the particular
                                 necessities for policing in each case.

                              <p id="d1e419">When doing research in Kenya for the EU-financed Horizon 2020 policing project, one
                                 reoccurring criticism from several interviews with the United Nations UNODC and UNDP
                                 programs was that these programs were ‘policy blind’ [<a href="#R69">69</a>]. The political strata was seen to be unwilling to discard criminal practices and
                                 criminal connections, instead leaving police reform as an exercise in fulfilling bureaucratic
                                 checkpoints. The NGOs underlined that the ability to handle crime becomes less important
                                 if one lacks the will, partly due to the involvement of elites in criminal activities.
                                 In one sense, the comments point to one of the essential features of this scenario,
                                 namely the lack of will to handle criminal networks despite having the resources to
                                 do so [<a href="#R70">70</a>]. Police reform quickly becomes merely an exercise for organizations to attempt to
                                 follow a list of benchmarks without understanding the situation; such material capacity
                                 building doesn’t necessarily transform into better policing. Attempts to use a standard
                                 set of strategies employed in East Asia, Europe, North Asia, Oceania or North America,
                                 might be counterproductive and even dangerous to policing, as the institutions and
                                 structures vary considerably.

                                 become essential. To read and understand the local situation becomes essential, requiring
                                 a broad dialogue locally, as well as particular understanding of the links between

                                 There are a number of potential key allies in police reform: for example, human rights
                                 groups could be act as a check on the police forces, while state institutions that
                                 are ‘cleaner’ (even cadre units within the police itself, isolated from the rest of
                                 the police forces) can be expanded and supported. Religious leaders with integrity
                                 could also be allies, as could journalists. In such situations, it is important to
                                 remember that the institutions with the ability to perform checks and balances in
                                 relation to the police could be in danger of facing violence from the police or allied
                                 gangs, although international pressure and international exposure might give some
                                 protection to such institutions. In order to achieve all of this, it is necessary
                                 to have a permanent and robust presence on the ground for international NGOs and other
                                 entities involved in police reform. Such presence becomes important in obtaining firsthand
                                 knowledge of the economic links and network links between individuals within the police,
                                 the government, various criminal groups, non-state commercial actors.

                              <p id="d1e431">The State/crime assemblage must be understood and the links and economic incentives
                                 sustaining them must be disentangled. To do so enables actors involved in police reform
                                 to block negative economic incentives, or to alter them in support of a police force
                                 disentangled from criminal groups and clientism. A paradox in this situation is that
                                 a general increase in police payment might alleviate some of the problems facing the
                                 police forces, as policemen become less dependent on criminal activities for income
                                 generation. If checks and balances fail to be implemented, international engagement
                                 might actually aid the buildup of criminal groups.

                              <p id="d1e433">Last but not least, a scenario might entail political reform or even political change
                                 - these situations have scared away international donors in the past. Political change
                                 is sensitive, can be seen as undue foreign interference in domestic politics and can
                                 lead to sanctions from the local political elite. Moreover, material support for the

                                 police reformers must understand that countermeasures may be necessary in such an
                                 environment, and be willing to implement countermeasures, even when it means challenges
                                 from local political elites. Strengthening policing includes pressure for political
                                 change and making important decisions over whether parallel governance systems should
                                 be included in efficient policing or be dismantled or detached from governance.

                              <p id="d1e443">A more common approach focusing on the state as the security provider, as it was conducted
                                 in Bosnia, might serve well in such a scenario [<a href="#R72">72</a>]. There will be pitfalls as local authoritarian traditions can create human rights
                                 violations, as well as a lack of contact between the police and the local communities.
                                 However, many of the experiences of common donors will be highly relevant, as the
                                 scenario reassembles police reform work in Europe, North-East Asia, Oceania and North
                                 America, where most donors came from. This is closer to the one-size fits all approach
                                 that several governments have promoted in the past. Experiences from donor countries
                                 and their recent attempts on police reform can be employed [<a href="#R73">73</a>]. Checks and balances do matter, as do efforts to improve transparency inside the
                                 police forces’ attempts to improve community interaction.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e451">Although this type of scenario is common in the West, western examples demonstrate
                                 its shortcomings. For example, trust between police and communities becomes very important,
                                 to ensure proper communication and that communities in general feel protected; local
                                 understanding is very important in this sense [<a href="#R74">74</a>, <a href="#R75">75</a>, <a href="#R76">76</a>]. In the past, the lack of such communication, in many cases created by the lack
                                 of trust, and the absence of a map of large-scale connections and overlaps between
                                 the police and crime groups have hampered police work in Europe and United States
                                 [<a href="#R77">77</a>, <a href="#R78">78</a>, <a href="#R79">79</a>, <a href="#R80">80</a>]. Top-down reforms become easier to implement due to hierarchy, while centralized
                                 police reform becomes easier to implement as it centralizes the monopoly of violence.

                              <p id="d1e478">In parts of Somalia such as the rural areas in the Bay-Bakool area or central Mudug,
                                 or in southern Algeria, it is difficult to spot any state institutions. The state,
                                 police forces included, is absent, save the odd military campaign or patrols; for
                                 locals, the police either do not exist or exist on an ad hoc basis. The state has
                                 a solid presence in many of these areas in the form of strong military units that
                                 are superior to insurgency forces, but do not engage in policing and providing local
                                 security at a regular basis.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e480">Local power holders as insurgents become important providers of security, either by
                                 attempting to create some form of security services for locals, or through becoming
                                 the producers of insecurity that locals have to envisage strategies in order to appease.
                                 As previously mentioned, such strategies can include appeasement through providing
                                 recruits, tax, or wives to insurgent outfits, which allow locals to embed themselves
                                 into insurgent groups and avoid sanctions through the creation of networks and connections.
                                 Forced recruitment and marriage might also take place.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e482">In some cases, other more informal governance entities, such as clans or tribes, might
                                 provide some police/security functions and their own justice mechanisms. However,
                                 several of these mechanisms might have serious drawbacks when it comes to gender issues
                                 and human rights. This means that any police reform will face a set of challenges,
                                 the first and foremost being the lack of will and capacity to establish the state,
                                 including the police in these areas. In some cases, it might not be cost-effective
                                 for the state to deploy in the areas. In other cases, it might be costly in the short
                                 term, but cost-effective in the long term - for example, by denying guerilla movements
                                 on the ground so the state will need convincing before deploying resources. When the
                                 state builds up a presence, it cannot be done piecemeal, as insurgents and local power
                                 holders would have the power to fight off small police forces. In Somalia, for example,
                                 a plan for three to five person police forces in the countryside had to be abandoned
                                 because of fears that Shabaab units would crush the Somali police. In Iraq, lightly
                                 armed community police units faced the same problem [<a href="#R13">13</a>, <a href="#R24">24</a>]. Police forces in the initial stage must be equipped to defend themselves from heavy
                                 attacks (which hampers their investigative efforts), and have to look more like heavy
                                 armed militias in order to survive.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e490">Community contacts become important, as do the provision of police services to the
                                 locals. Local communities will most likely face severe deprecations if seen supporting
                                 new police forces before a secure environment is created, and thus hostility from
                                 the local communities, with severe reprisals against ethnic groups supporting the
                                 police becomes likely. Steps to protect local allies must be enhanced, and possible
                                 military units might be involved in creating a security environment more conducive
                                 to normal policing. Standardized police programs based on experiences and techniques
                                 from Europe, North Asia, North America and Oceania are less suited for this type of
                                 police reform, and counterinsurgency techniques focusing on protecting local populations
                                 and security forces must be given priority. Police units, also community police, have
                                 to be heavily coordinated with other security forces in order to receive quick reinforcements
                                 if needed, and have to have heavy armaments.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e492">Local allies, if supported and provided with ample security, can be valuable in upholding
                                 justice. Local clan mechanisms, for example, can be used to relieve the police of
                                 duties and to act as force multipliers. In the case of lack of state capacity or local
                                 legitimacy, such use of local clan mechanisms or community policing programs might
                                 become the only viable option in justice provision in the foreseeable future, and
                                 might have been so in the past. They might be the nucleus of a new policing regime
                                 that does not reassemble any Westphalian type of state and yet be the only realistic
                                 alternative. However, this solution has many drawbacks: for example, human rights
                                 shortcomings, in the form of discrimination against females or ethnic minorities,
                                 are in many ways entrenched in traditional governance systems as clans or tribal entities.
                                 Such problems have been addressed by dialogue in the past, and local structures can
                                 be flexible and possibly influenced through interaction with outsiders [<a href="#R81">81</a>]. Also, local allies often need to defend themselves and their institutions against
                                 insurgents and criminal groups; if this is not forthcoming, these allies might disappear
                                 when outside support is still needed.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e497">In such areas, efforts to create a secure environment conducive to policing should
                                 be prioritized over normal police duties. The scenario is simply not fit for ‘ordinary’
                                 police forces, something that must be considered when designing police forces for
                                 cases reassembling the traits of this scenario. In such zones, law and order and the
                                 sense of ordinary justice for the local population is essential. Violent organizations
                                 such as the Shabaab, the Lord’s Resistance Army and the Allied Democratic Forces have
                                 used such zones for survival and have staged large attacks out of them [<a href="#R16">16</a>, <a href="#R17">17</a>].

                              <p id="d1e508">The enclave scenario also brings large dilemmas to police reform, some of which are
                                 political. For instance, as when the Islamic State governed parts of Iraq and Syria,
                                 the local power holder might provide forms of justice and police services, but will
                                 transgress human rights and have aggressive goals [<a href="#R57">57</a>, <a href="#R58">58</a>, <a href="#R59">59</a>]. In such cases, an engagement in building up police forces or reforming police will
                                 be seriously hampered by hostility from potential donors. Moreover, the survival of
                                 the enclave could be in doubt. Local actors that are not accepted by a majority of
                                 international states can nevertheless adroitly provide police services to the local
                                 population, which could present a major dilemma is if such enclaves also should be
                                 a possible nucleus for creating local police forces. This presents a political question:
                                 is it state-building or the provision of police services that should be the priority?
                                 After all, an enclave might have a better system for provision of police services
                                 than the state it nominally is a part of. Supporting enclave policing based on the
                                 rebel faction in control might be the best way to provide services locally, but could
                                 counter-act state-building processes, and creating the appearance of taking sides
                                 in a civil war situation. This creates its own issues – often, the rebel ruler will
                                 also be unacceptable to the international community.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e519">This is similar to the problems between Somalia and the self-declared state of Somaliland,
                                 where the latter, although not internationally recognized, produces more extensive
                                 and better services (including policing). The Somaliland/Somalia situation has been
                                 largely solved by seeking the approval of the government of Somalia for projects implemented
                                 in Somaliland, and by standardizing equipment and education in projects targeting
                                 both the enclave, and forces outside of the enclave. In other instances, such as the
                                 Kurdish self-governed areas or in the case of pre-independence Kosovo, the West chose
                                 to back police reform: in the first case as a part of a more federal arrangement,
                                 but also as an acceptance that the lack of trust in Iraq made national policing in
                                 the Kurdish areas impossible.
                                 A secondary question arises in whether an enclave could be a part of a state-building
                                 effort? The power dynamics within international relations are a central force within
                                 this question, especially the consideration of which powers support the enclave and
                                 which powers support the state’s leadership. International politics will thus limit
                                 the possibilities for international engagement. However, it should be noted that engagement
                                 with enclaves might be highly useful - in the case of pre-independence Kosovo, the
                                 West chose to back police reform, in the first case as a part of a more federal arrangement,
                                 but also as an acceptance that the lack of trust. In Iraq, this strategy made national
                                 policing in the Kurdish areas impossible. In the second case, the purpose was to build
                                 up a new state. In Somalia, one also chose to engage Somaliland, despite the second
                                 entity lacking backing for independence [<a href="#R24">24</a>]. The Federal system in Somalia was to a certain extent based on enclave thinking,
                                 as the central government lacked the necessary trust to do large-scale policing in
                                 regional entities such as the Juba State and Puntland. The solution was found in creating
                                 both local police handled by the enclave, as well as a federal police structure handling
                                 border patrols and investigations in the capital, all while including weak mechanisms
                                 of centralization in the process. These mechanisms included common training sessions,
                                 common uniforms, etc [<a href="#R13">13</a>, <a href="#R24">24</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e530">When dealing with an enclave that is not aggressive and avoids substantial human rights
                                 violations, the question also turns political. Should human security and the service
                                 provision given to locals count more than vague dreams of future centralization and
                                 central state building? Can federalization be a tool to make police reform acceptable
                                 to international actors? Will police reform inside the enclave really undermine state
                                 building, when the central state lacks presence in the enclave anyway? Can the Somalia/Somaliland
                                 solution be a model in other cases? If the political issues are overcome, the police
                                 reform efforts might be efficient. Moreover, as illustrated in the above discussions,
                                 there are thus possible mechanisms that can promote the integration of the police
                                 forces from the enclave into a larger police force.

                              <p id="d1e535">It is easy to develop general practices for police reform which are seen as globally
                                 valid. However, research literature rightly suggests that local conditions must be
                                 taken into consideration when designing a police reform program. Additionally, reform
                                 must be open for a variety of intentions from the local elite, and it must be able
                                 to handle the level of violence taking place locally. Today, police forces in peacekeeping
                                 missions are required to undergo considerable training before they go into deployment,
                                 and UN organizations have developed common training programs [<a href="#R82">82</a>], such as the Standardized Generic Training Modules (SGTMs), the Core Pre-deployment
                                 Training Materials (CPTM) and the Specialized Training Materials (STMs). Although
                                 these programs are designed for peacekeeping and not for police reform (and therefore
                                 have an operational focus), they illustrate a lack of local adaptation.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e540">A typology as presented here can help police experts go beyond these standardized
                                 curriculums to understand that variations in context should influence the structure
                                 of a police reform or of new institutions. Additionally, the typology will enable
                                 individuals in the field to think systematically about variables that influence structure
                                 and training. The ideal type of scenarios will hopefully also serve as a point of
                                 departure for future discussions that might refine them.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e542">These scenarios serve as a useful reminder that police reform is influenced by both
                                 global and local politics, and that politics often must to be addressed in order to
                                 achieve successful results (yet actors such as the UN often shun away from this).
                                 It also highlights the uncomfortable fact that the local provision of basic human
                                 security and policing at times can be thwarted by or sacrificed for a larger state-building
                                 agenda, even where a centralized state might not have existed in the past. These scenarios
                                 remind us of the importance of taking the locals seriously, and seeing possibilities
                                 as well as challenges in local dynamics. To study variations over the territorial
                                 control variable might help in better understanding the local challenges faced by
                                 the police in many countries in the world, and to understand how these challenges
                                 can be met.

                                          of violence is reached, normal policing is not possible. What you then get is a police

                                          commanded by the state with little contact with the local communities.
