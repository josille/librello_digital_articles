                              space, and a great number of people needing medical assistance. Public transportation
                              has been the target of such attacks and involves a high probability of generating
                              mass casualties. The review aimed to investigate challenges for on-scene responses
                              to MCAs and suggestions made to counter these challenges, with special attention given
                              to attacks on public transportation and associated terminals. Methods: Articles were
                              found through PubMed and Scopus, “relevant articles” as defined by the databases,
                              and a manual search of references. Inclusion criteria were that the article referred
                              to attack(s) and/or a public transportation-related incident and issues concerning
                              formal on-scene response. An appraisal of the articles’ scientific quality was conducted
                              based on an evidence hierarchy model developed for the study. Results: One hundred
                              and five articles were reviewed. Challenges for command and coordination on scene
                              included establishing leadership, inter-agency collaboration, multiple incident sites,
                              and logistics. Safety issues entailed knowledge and use of personal protective equipment,
                              risk awareness and expectations, cordons, dynamic risk assessment, defensive versus
                              offensive approaches, and joining forces. Communication concerns were equipment shortfalls,
                              dialoguing, and providing information. Assessment problems were scene layout and interpreting
                              environmental indicators as well as understanding setting-driven needs for specialist
                              skills and resources. Triage and treatment difficulties included differing triage
                              systems, directing casualties, uncommon injuries, field hospitals, level of care,
                              providing psychological and pediatric care. Transportation hardships included scene
                              access, distance to hospitals, and distribution of casualties. Conclusion: Commonly
                              encountered challenges during unintentional incidents were added to during MCAs, implying
                              specific issues for safety, assessment, triage, and treatment, which require training.
                              Effectively increasing readiness for MCAs likely entail struggles to overcome fragmentation
                              between the emergency services and the broader crisis management system as well as
                              enabling critical and prestige-less, context-based assessments of needed preparatory
                              efforts.</span></div>

                              <p id="d1e81">The scene of an antagonistically induced mass-casualty incident, also called mass-casualty
                                 attack (MCA) [<a href="#R01">1</a>], entails a crime scene, a hazardous space, and medical challenge, demanding a complex
                                 response by the police, rescue services and emergency medical services (EMS). Countering
                                 the aspects, with overlaying short- and long-term priorities and differing organizational
                                 roles, is key to optimal functioning in the response stage of an event. This includes
                                 early planning for transfer of response organizations to the scene of the attack,
                                 prevention of disturbances and additional attacks, and prompt and efficient care of
                                 the victims [<a href="#R02">2</a>]. It also implies a need to take care so that the initial rescue priorities do not
                                 unnecessarily impact long-term priorities, such as careless handling of bodies which
                                 could reduce the possibility of identification [<a href="#R03">3</a>]. Response to an MCA thus creates high demands for all the emergency organizations
                                 to work together, to carry out their own responsibilities, and achieve the collective
                                 goal of limiting the consequences of the attack. Maximizing effectiveness of event
                                 management constitutes a defensive counter-terrorism measure—which Perliger and colleagues
                                 [<a href="#R02">2</a>] hold are warranted—instead of focusing only on active offensive methods, as terrorism
                                 cannot be entirely prevented.

                                 transportation. This has been the case in some of the more publicized MCAs during

                                 to the previous three decades of the study period. Simultaneously, attacks against
                                 terminal buildings, multiple targets, and using complex tactical approaches increased
                                 during that decade [<a href="#R01">1</a>]. This may imply that preparedness among contemporary emergency organizations needs
                                 to include the ability to manage large numbers of injured people, possibly at multiple
                                 locations, including confined or collapsed spaces, in a hostile and hazardous environment.

                                 local medical resources [<a href="#R09">9</a>]. Furthermore, civilian terrorist bombings represent unique challenges to the trauma
                                 system, e.g., they often include an urban setting, security and field triage challenges,
                                 distinctive injury patterns, and a rapid transfer and distribution of casualties to
                                 appropriate hospitals [<a href="#R06">6</a>]. Victims of terrorist attacks may also present a combination of blast, blunt, penetrating

                                 manage, as they may initially may be occult, with no visible signs of injury [<a href="#R10">10</a>, <a href="#R11">11</a>, <a href="#R12">12</a>, <a href="#R13">13</a>, <a href="#R14">14</a>, <a href="#R15">15</a>]. The setting of modern urban terrorist bombings also means that civilian medical
                                 systems are confronted with patients arriving at the hospital alive who would likely
                                 have died of their injuries in previous conventional war settings [<a href="#R06">6</a>]. Moreover, there is a difference in those at risk of injury in a military setting
                                 versus those in a civilian setting, where the civilian environment includes children
                                 and the elderly [<a href="#R16">16</a>, <a href="#R17">17</a>, <a href="#R18">18</a>, <a href="#R19">19</a>]. Antagonistic acts thus result in injuries that are not commonly encountered in
                                 the civilian environment and also augment the challenges of an unintentional mass-casualty
                                 incident by adding the factor of a hostile environment which together, demand other
                                 approaches by the responders on scene. In-depth studies of previous responses are
                                 one way to enable preparation of a more effective emergency response in the immediate
                                 aftermath of an attack [<a href="#R09">9</a>, <a href="#R20">20</a>].

                              <p id="d1e188">The aim of the review was to analyze research on challenges for on-scene responses
                                 to mass-casualty attacks and suggestions made to counter these challenges, with special
                                 attention given to attacks on public transportation and associated terminals. The
                                 discussion considers how overarching findings can be used in efforts to increase preparedness.

                              <p id="d1e193">This integrative literature review set out to generate new knowledge about responses
                                 to attacks through review, critique and synthesis of representative literature in
                                 an integrated manner [<a href="#R21">21</a>]. Searches of the databases PubMed and Scopus, as well as references from extracted
                                 articles, were conducted in order to limit the risk of systematic errors. Previous
                                 studies have indicated that one database search is not enough to find all the studies
                                 that have the potential to answer a research question [<a href="#R22">22</a>]. Searches were conducted in MEDLINE (PubMed) and Scopus in July 2014, and again
                                 in May 2015, for articles about on-scene response to terrorist attacks (all published
                                 between 1970 and 2015 in the English language). In PubMed, several test searches—with
                                 different MeSH-terms, free text words, and filters—were conducted in order to find
                                 a balance between a too-narrow and a too-broad search [<a href="#R22">22</a>]. Components identified as search clusters in order to find articles of interest
                                 were: intentionality (weapons, explosions and terrorism), target (transportation),
                                 and consequence and management (wounds and injuries, disasters, emergency responders
                                 and emergency medical services). All words were used as MeSH-terms except for “terrorism”
                                 and “transportation”, which were also used as “free text keywords”: these terms led
                                 to the identification of relevant articles while simply having them as MeSH terms
                                 meant erroneous exclusion of relevant articles. One word from each cluster needed
                                 to be present for the article to be found in the search. A similar search was conducted
                                 in Scopus thereafter in order to find more articles related to the police and rescue
                                 services, complementing the medical perspective more prominent in PubMed. Slightly
                                 different keywords and clusters were used as MeSH terms could not be used in Scopus
                                 and the aim was to identify more articles regarding the police and rescue service
                                 (Table <a href="#Tab01">1</a>). For each title selected, additional titles of interest were also found through
                                 the box “related citations in PubMed” or the box “related documents” in Scopus.

                                 2, i.e. did not contain detailed descriptions of challenges during civilian incident
                                 management. This inclusion criteria also meant that reports of incident management
                                 without formal prehospital response were excluded, which implies inclusion of articles
                                 mainly from OECD countries. The findings are therefore applicable primarily in such
                                 contexts.

                              <p id="d1e288">To assess the scientific quality of each included article, an adapted model of evidence
                                 hierarchy was created (including study designs; Figure <a href="#Fig01">1</a>), based on evidence ratings and descriptions of study design from the medical field
                                 [<a href="#R22">22</a>, <a href="#R23">23</a>, <a href="#R24">24</a>]. However, research regarding disasters, crises, or mass-casualty incidents is not
                                 limited to health and medical science fields. The subject also presents intrinsic
                                 research challenges and is not an area that can be approached through experimental
                                 studies such as randomized-controlled trials (RCT). This does not imply that it cannot
                                 be the subject of rigorous research, but rather necessitates an adapted evidence hierarchy
                                 model that includes the types of studies involved in this multi-disciplinary research
                                 field. The study design and method by which the research is carried out and presented,
                                 constitute integral parts to the assessment of a study’s quality. Different study
                                 designs are suitable depending on the research question, but certain study designs
                                 are generally allotted higher evidence value, illustrated by schematic pyramids of
                                 evidence hierarchy where the studies higher up the pyramid are assigned higher evidence
                                 value, given that they are properly conducted and described [<a href="#R22">22</a>, <a href="#R23">23</a>]. Meta-analyses and RCTs were excluded in the adapted model, as there were no such
                                 studies included in the review, while systematic reviews and cross-sectional studies
                                 were considered a basis for high-quality evidence. The articles constituting medium
                                 evidence-based studies were the “retrospective case series” (a research design normally
                                 seen in the medical field), the “comparative case studies” (a research design used
                                 within the political science field), and “case studies”. Lastly, non-systematic reviews,
                                 guidelines, special reports, consensus statements, and perspective articles were considered
                                 to have lower evidence value, mainly due to lacking or no presentation of aim, methods
                                 or references in these articles.

                                 service, and ambulance staff, and it has a medical focus that corresponded well with
                                 the findings of the literature search. The defined management priorities Command,
                                 Safety, Communication, Assessment, Triage, Treatment, and Transport, used in MIMMS,
                                 constituted the basis for extraction of information, word-for-word, from the articles.
                                 Command entailed issues concerning vertical and horizontal leadership of the overall
                                 rescue effort on scene and re-occurring management challenges. Safety included issues

                                 an unintentional safety risk and threat denoting an intentional one. Communication
                                 involved issues with transmission of information within and between personnel in the
                                 emergency organizations on scene, and along the chain of command, as well as to supporting
                                 organizations and facilities and other persons requiring information. Assessment included
                                 issues of interest for the ambulance service in order to make estimates of the number

                                 on scene, and the people who provide care. Transport included issues of accessing,

                                             have been commonly reported problems during responses to MCAs [<a href="#R02">2</a>, <a href="#R27">27</a>, <a href="#R28">28</a>, <a href="#R29">29</a>, <a href="#R30">30</a>]. The presence of several representatives of similar emergency organizations and
                                             several responders in a leadership position have also amounted to confusion, contradictory
                                             orders, and complications for scene management [<a href="#R30">30</a>, <a href="#R31">31</a>]. Early establishment of a common operating picture with all involved agencies gathered
                                             in a multidisciplinary, unified command at an Incident Command Post (ICP), has been
                                             critical for the synchronization and effectiveness of rescue operations [<a href="#R04">4</a>, <a href="#R05">5</a>, <a href="#R14">14</a>, <a href="#R32">32</a>, <a href="#R33">33</a>]. According to Perliger et al. [<a href="#R02">2</a>], a clear picture of the situation and proper coordination during the first minutes
                                             after an attack had a greater effect on the duration of the on-scene management process
                                             than the number of medical staff or the number of wounded people. Increased standardization

                                             distribution of duties between the involved emergency organizations, could increase

Pre-event collaboration plans may also need to include policies for cross-border
                                             medical responses [37] and use of military units [<a href="#R38">38</a>] or specific sea rescue organizations [<a href="#R35">35</a>]. Priorities on the incident site should not be viewed as sequential. Instead, several
                                             actions need to occur simultaneously, carried out by different rescue organizations
                                             [<a href="#R05">5</a>, <a href="#R29">29</a>, <a href="#R34">34</a>]. This necessitates functional inter-agency collaboration with clearly pre-determined,
                                             common principles for incident management and defined tasks and responsibilities of
                                             each organization, which in turn need to be drilled [<a href="#R02">2</a>, <a href="#R05">5</a>, <a href="#R34">34</a>, <a href="#R39">39</a>]. If responders are not aware of the others’ identities, roles, or tasks, problems
                                             in the inter-agency cooperation will likely arise [<a href="#R39">39</a>]. Intra- and inter-agency cooperation and coordination is required for efficient
                                             management, but such cooperation is complicated as a large number of teams assemble,
                                             each with its own goals, its own organizational terminology, and its own supervision

                                          <p id="d1e895">Challenges with coordination have been most commonly seen at events where there has
                                             been several incident sites or more than one evacuation point [<a href="#R02">2</a>, <a href="#R42">42</a>]. When several attacks have occurred simultaneously and in geographically proximal
                                             areas, there has been confusion regarding the number of incidents [<a href="#R20">20</a>, <a href="#R30">30</a>]. This confusion leads to misunderstandings at EMS dispatch about the location of
                                             the scenes, resulting in severe maldistribution of medical assets and personnel, and
                                             greatly varying levels of treatment [<a href="#R30">30</a>]. In order to avoid such issues, a functional central command level is essential,
                                             as multiple incidents often aggravate communication and coordination problems [<a href="#R20">20</a>]. Multi-site incidents may also increase coordination demands due to occurrence within
                                             a catchment area of several EMS systems or jurisdiction of several involved agencies
                                             [<a href="#R42">42</a>, <a href="#R43">43</a>]. Another problem for incident command may occur if there are multiple exits available
                                             from the site, e.g. incidents in tunnels, on ferries or islands, as casualties can
                                             escape in several directions. This can result in dispersal of responders and can complicate
                                             organization of clearing stations and evacuation, but management may be alleviated
                                             by setting up several command posts [<a href="#R42">42</a>, <a href="#R44">44</a>, <a href="#R45">45</a>].

                                             connected to communication deficiencies. Timely and adequate supply of clothing, tools,
                                             and equipment is important, e.g., for identification, safety, debris removal, and

                                             shortage supplying an excess of resources and personnel may lead to difficulties in

                                             delay casualty evacuation [<a href="#R02">2</a>, <a href="#R33">33</a>, <a href="#R40">40</a>, <a href="#R47">47</a>].

                                       [<a href="#R06">6</a>, <a href="#R14">14</a>, <a href="#R25">25</a>, <a href="#R48">48</a>]. Rescue personnel have to face a reality where there is a need to worry about their
                                       own and the victims’ safety, as well as demands to manage life-threatening injuries
                                       [<a href="#R06">6</a>]. According to Kashuk et al. [<a href="#R06">6</a>], balancing such safety concerns with expeditious casualty care requires training,
                                       in addition to a well-developed work ethics base and, optimally, actual experience.

                                          <p id="d1e985">To be able to work on site, all rescue personnel need to be familiar with personal
                                             protective equipment (PPE; e.g., helmet and respiratory protection), and the equipment
                                             needs to be immediately available in the response vehicles [<a href="#R44">44</a>, <a href="#R46">46</a>]. Respiratory protection, for example, is not just applicable to minimize inhalation
                                             of intentional chemical or biological agents, but also airborne particles present
                                             after bombings or after a building collapse [<a href="#R44">44</a>]. Lack of PPE use by responders has been seen during previous responses, with several
                                             accounts of on- and off-duty staff working on scenes wearing scrubs, surgical masks,
                                             and clogs [<a href="#R28">28</a>, <a href="#R45">45</a>, <a href="#R49">49</a>, <a href="#R50">50</a>, <a href="#R51">51</a>]. Responders from involved emergency organizations may not be equally aware of the
                                             risks to themselves during shooting incidents or of the limitations of their protective
                                             gear. Military rounds, e.g., those used in high-velocity weapons, can easily penetrate
                                             the sides of a vehicle as well as some bullet-resistant vests [<a href="#R04">4</a>]. Thus, while they may stop bullets from some guns, it is important not to assume
                                             that “bullet-resistant vests” are “bulletproof vests” [<a href="#R04">4</a>, <a href="#R52">52</a>].

                                          <p id="d1e1024">Caution is warranted during scene approach, as initial reports may have given the
                                             wrong location, and thus rescue personnel may place themselves and their vehicles
                                             at risk of unintentional hazard or an intentional threat [<a href="#R04">4</a>, <a href="#R53">53</a>]. Following an attack, responders need to consider the risk of secondary explosions
                                             or coordinated attacks [<a href="#R20">20</a>], as attacks are sometimes arranged to create a need for a rescue effort through
                                             an action, to then target rescue personnel on arrival [<a href="#R04">4</a>, <a href="#R07">7</a>, <a href="#R09">9</a>, <a href="#R33">33</a>]. Several case studies however, tell of lapses in determining presence or absence
                                             of secondary explosives [<a href="#R30">30</a>, <a href="#R45">45</a>], and undetonated devices have been present at several attack sites [<a href="#R30">30</a>, <a href="#R45">45</a>], implying that personnel have provided treatment and placed casualty tents within
                                             the risk zone of undetonated devices [<a href="#R07">7</a>, <a href="#R30">30</a>]. In one case, the police collecting belongings unknowingly brought an undetonated
                                             device to the police station [<a href="#R07">7</a>, <a href="#R30">30</a>]. As opposed to responses revealing a lack of risk awareness, exercises have also
                                             revealed unrealistic expectations of safety at hostile event scenes by EMS and fire
                                             services. The difficult and time-consuming practice of waiting for a full risk assessment
                                             could delay provision of life-saving care [<a href="#R55">55</a>]. Thus, it is not always possible to secure the entire site quickly enough to refrain
                                             from continuing the rescue effort. Responses to MCAs may require a transition into
                                             thinking of “relative safety” and “plus one” threat (e.g., looking for secondary devices
                                             or a perpetrator among the victims)—a frame of thought implying wariness of safety
                                             threats without expecting the entire scene to be secured before acting [<a href="#R05">5</a>]. In a systematic review, Thompson et al. further showed that while the scene of
                                             a terrorist attack includes direct threats, the published literature suggests that
                                             dominant causes of mortality and morbidity in responders after such incidents have
                                             been due to indirect environmental hazards [<a href="#R56">56</a>].

                                             scene from both present threats and potential hazards, which need to be continuously
                                             re-evaluated by way of a dynamic risk assessment as the rescue and tactical situation
                                             may change [<a href="#R41">41</a>, <a href="#R44">44</a>, <a href="#R49">49</a>]. If there are no set policy decisions regarding whether to go in or wait, i.e. “rules
                                             of engagement”, the decision ought to be made by someone with management responsibility
                                             and not left to individual responders [<a href="#R44">44</a>, <a href="#R55">55</a>]. During MCA responses, there is a need to move people away from the scene [<a href="#R08">8</a>, <a href="#R20">20</a>], i.e., evacuate casualties, distance civilians, perform crowd control [34], and
                                             control access by checking personnel identification [<a href="#R09">9</a>]. A suitable division of a scene may be one with three cordons, similar to those
                                             used in the UK [<a href="#R20">20</a>]. In a schematic representation (Figure <a href="#Fig03">3</a>), the “middle cordon” could be an established safe area, functioning as a buffer
                                             area, allowing for triage and life-saving treatment of casualties outside of the immediate
                                             danger area found in the “inner circle”. The “outer circle” would then contain the
                                             designated evacuation roads, identification control, and searched buildings. The police’s
                                             ability to create and regulate the cordons is an essential task for alleviating management
                                             and provision of important medical procedures and hindering follow-up attacks [<a href="#R20">20</a>, <a href="#R33">33</a>, <a href="#R47">47</a>]. Cordons also constitute an important measure to protect forensic evidence and control
                                             the flow of personnel and traffic [<a href="#R14">14</a>], but they need to operate while minimizing barriers for essential equipment, staff,
                                             and patients [<a href="#R02">2</a>, <a href="#R43">43</a>, <a href="#R57">57</a>], through pre-determined plans and functional inter-agency cooperation [<a href="#R02">2</a>].

                                          <p id="d1e1148">[10]Approaches to scene safety and management on scene differ throughout the world,
                                             depending on the local context, governance, and experiences of attacks. Based on conflict
                                             experiences in Colombia, responders do not enter a scene without governmental provision
                                             of troops in order to assure security [<a href="#R20">20</a>]. Experience with follow-up attacks in Israel has led to the enactment of different
                                             regulations at different times [<a href="#R32">32</a>, <a href="#R33">33</a>]. At one point, regulations forbade medical forces from entering the scene until
                                             the police had given the all-clear, but these were not strictly adhered to, and opposite
                                             policies have also been described where EMS do not wait for security clearance [<a href="#R33">33</a>]. Instead, wearing their mandatory protective gear, they attempt to remove casualties
                                             from the immediate vicinity of the initial event, only providing external hemorrhage
                                             control before doing so [<a href="#R32">32</a>]. The first example describes a more defensive approach to safety while the latter
                                             tells of a more offensive approach. The offensive approach implies an aggressive entry
                                             into an unsecured scene containing casualties, followed by rapidly addressing correctable
                                             trauma and promptly evacuating victims in a joint entry involving police and medical
                                             personnel [5]. The 1999 Columbine school shooting constituted a watershed incident
                                             in the development of the more offensive approach, leading the police to adopt an
                                             “active shooter” tactic. During similar incidents, the tactic implies that police
                                             rush into the building and attempt to end the threat instead of awaiting the Special
                                             Weapons and Tactical (SWAT) team. At the time of the Columbine shooting, the previous
                                             tactic led to some of the fatalities and morbidity among casualties due to unchecked
                                             hemorrhage and chock, as a result of delay in threat neutralization and care. Use
                                             of the changed tactic has allowed tactical medics to provide care before entire scene
                                             safety clearance [29,58]. The change in tactics have also resulted from experiences
                                             of combat trauma, which can amount to similar injury patterns as those in active shooter
                                             incidents and terrorist attacks. Thus, the prehospital guidelines of Tactical Combat
                                             Casualty Care (TCCC), customized for use on the battlefield to avoid common causes
                                             of preventable death in combat, have increasingly gained acceptance in the civilian
                                             trauma care system and the principles have been adapted into different training programs
                                             for care during civilian tactical situations [<a href="#R29">29</a>].

                                          <p id="d1e1188">Traditionally, the responsibilities and responses of the emergency organizations to
                                             MCAs have been viewed as separate actions conducted sequentially. However, death due
                                             to exsanguination from a proximal extremity vascular disruption can occur in as little
                                             as 4-5 minutes, implying that the typical sequential response of law enforcement followed
                                             by EMS and rescue services cannot happen fast enough to avoid preventable death [<a href="#R29">29</a>, <a href="#R58">58</a>]. The resultant need for an integrated response of the emergency organizations increases
                                             inter-agency dependence and requires joint training as well as raised awareness in
                                             risk assessment. This is to enable an adaptable response to the situation in terms
                                             of safety risks and the need to provide care [<a href="#R05">5</a>]. Autrey et al. [<a href="#R05">5</a>] described an approach that guides the initial 30 minutes of a response to a blast
                                             or active shooter event, which can be remembered through the mnemonic “3 Echo”, representing
                                             “Enter”, “Evaluate”, and “Evacuate”. In an effort to deal with the dilemma of responder
                                             safety (entering a scene too early) versus delayed care to victims (entering a scene
                                             too late), the approach presents the use of “evacuation corridors” to gain access
                                             to victims by initially securing functional areas instead of the entire site [<a href="#R05">5</a>]. In accordance with the 3 Echo principles, during a mass-shooting police immediately
                                             entered the building to contain and neutralize the threat. Simultaneously, locations
                                             of casualties were identified and communicated to incident command. Additional arriving
                                             support began to create cover, establish cordons, create command, staging areas, and
                                             coordinate medical asset deployment. Next, a secondary group of police officers gained
                                             access to identified casualties and secured the immediate area where they were located,
                                             rapidly identified viable victims, developed an evacuation corridor from a safe point
                                             of entry, and called in EMS from the staging area. EMS personnel then entered the
                                             secured corridor under police escort, and injured casualties were rapidly body swept
                                             for weapons and immediately treated with tourniquets if needed. Then, they were evacuated
                                             along the corridor to safe staging before being rapidly transported to a suitable
                                             health care facility. Police security screened the walking wounded as they were guided
                                             out of the hazard area to assembly areas for treatment on scene or medical transportation

                                          <p id="d1e1258">One of the most frequent problems with communication is technical inadequacy, shown
                                             by overload of landline telephones, mobile networks, and radio-channels on walkie-talkies
                                             [<a href="#R07">7</a>, <a href="#R20">20</a>, <a href="#R28">28</a>, <a href="#R30">30</a>, <a href="#R31">31</a>, <a href="#R40">40</a>, <a href="#R43">43</a>, <a href="#R45">45</a>, <a href="#R47">47</a>, <a href="#R55">55</a>, <a href="#R63">63</a>, <a href="#R64">64</a>, <a href="#R65">65</a>, <a href="#R66">66</a>, <a href="#R67">67</a>]. Equipment failure has also been caused by actual physical damage to the communication
                                             infrastructure [40,64,68]. Incompatible equipment and separate coordination centers
                                             between involved emergency organizations and between civilian and military actors
                                             have likewise caused communication and cooperation problems [<a href="#R30">30</a>, <a href="#R67">67</a>]. Consequences of equipment breakdown include inability to call in more staff or
                                             resources, failure to keep track of units on scene or inform them of safety issues,
                                             or prompting staff to drive to the scenes without knowing where to respond and stage
                                             [<a href="#R40">40</a>, <a href="#R43">43</a>, <a href="#R64">64</a>, <a href="#R68">68</a>]. To overcome communication shortfalls on scene, hand-held megaphones, runners, and
                                             hand signals can be used, but hand signals would require clear visibility and prior
                                             training [<a href="#R20">20</a>, <a href="#R32">32</a>, <a href="#R35">35</a>, <a href="#R43">43</a>]. Two-way radios with dedicated channels have often provided a good communication
                                             alternative, but it can be impeded in some locations, such as the subway, near crash
                                             sites, and in buildings [<a href="#R06">6</a>, <a href="#R45">45</a>, <a href="#R69">69</a>]. Other communication solutions seen have been cellphone providers donating phones
                                             and activating reserve system capacity [<a href="#R47">47</a>] or an alternative system for emergency communication only [<a href="#R64">64</a>]. For maximum effectiveness, schemes of access overload control need to be pre-arranged
                                             [<a href="#R59">59</a>]. The procedure could also permit the police to block cell phone frequencies in certain
                                             areas to prevent potential activation of secondary devices, without leaving units
                                             on scene deprived of means of communication [<a href="#R30">30</a>].

                                          <p id="d1e1364">While functional equipment is a prerequisite for functional communication, communication
                                             breakdown might still occur due to failure in the process of exchange of information,
                                             e.g. due to absence of training, poor compliance with basic principles for communication
                                             or lack of routine procedures for relaying information [<a href="#R02">2</a>, <a href="#R33">33</a>, <a href="#R39">39</a>]. Functional communication between and within organizations is important [2] and
                                             may be eased through use of a common lexicon to avoid different interpretations of
                                             terms used [<a href="#R20">20</a>]. Language barriers between the responders and casualties as well as temporary deafness
                                             of bombing victims have constituted other communication difficulties [<a href="#R20">20</a>, <a href="#R35">35</a>, <a href="#R70">70</a>, <a href="#R71">71</a>]. Problems with relaying information between responder units have coincided with
                                             large incident scenes and units divided into sub-zones [<a href="#R72">72</a>]. Information relay has also been problematic due to noise levels, e.g. by helicopters
                                             with rotors [<a href="#R35">35</a>] and heavy machinery [<a href="#R49">49</a>]. Information relay between the incident site, EMS, and the emergency department
                                             (ED) have been lacking repeatedly, e.g. regarding the size and complexity of the incident
                                             [<a href="#R08">8</a>, <a href="#R20">20</a>, <a href="#R28">28</a>, <a href="#R30">30</a>, <a href="#R55">55</a>, <a href="#R73">73</a>]. Transmitting and documenting detailed information about the patients constitutes
                                             another challenge during MCAs as initial triage, treatment, and transfer is often
                                             conducted by different responders, with little or no contact among them. This means
                                             essential patient data and valuable time is lost repeatedly throughout the caregiving
                                             process [<a href="#R30">30</a>]. Several researchers therefore stress the need for documentation and information
                                             transfer, e.g., through easy-to-read triage tags [<a href="#R30">30</a>, <a href="#R68">68</a>].

                                             effort, information also needs to reach survivors, relatives, and the general public.
                                             Keeping relatives and victims informed may prevent problems post-trauma [<a href="#R64">64</a>]. Moreover, clear communication with the public, providing simple information, directions,
                                             and advice regarding what has happened and what to do, may calm fears, discourage
                                             people from assembling at hospitals and incident scenes, and lessen calls to emergency

                                             pressure from the dispatch center [<a href="#R20">20</a>, <a href="#R65">65</a>]. Arranging a temporary Crisis Information Center or Family Assistance Center, staffed
                                             by psychologists, nurses, and social workers, have been other examples of aids to
                                             help identify and locate victims and retrieve information regarding their condition
                                             or liaise between other supportive services [<a href="#R69">69</a>, <a href="#R74">74</a>, <a href="#R75">75</a>]. A method for dealing with the media ought to be included in emergency plans [<a href="#R47">47</a>]; previous incidents have shown that if information and clear directions are not
                                             given, there may be dissemination of misinformation, hospital referral numbers, or

                                             have also been examples where television and radio channels have worked as a means

                                    <p id="d1e1481">All involved organizations make their own assessments of the scene reflecting their
                                       responsibilities and expertise, but this section focuses on the EMS organization in
                                       accordance with the reviewed articles. In order to enable an organized response, one
                                       person on the first medical team on scene is appointed “medic in charge” or “medical
                                       incident commander” (MIC). The role implies focus on facilitating the EMS chain of
                                       command by being the eyes and ears “on the ground” and transferring this information
                                       to EMS central command. This assessment process is started by refraining from rendering
                                       medical help, concentrating instead on a rapid scene assessment and communicating
                                       to EMS central command: (1) the Exact location of the scene; (2) Type of event; (3)
                                       present and potential Hazards; (4) Access via primary routes for approach and evacuation,
                                       and the location of the Incident Command Point; (5) the estimated Number (few, tens,
                                       hundreds) and severity of casualties; and (6) Extra resources needed [<a href="#R06">6</a>, <a href="#R25">25</a>, <a href="#R32">32</a>, <a href="#R34">34</a>]. These crucial pieces of information may be recalled by the mnemonic “ETHANE”. “METHANE”
                                       may also be used, where the “M” denotes declaring a “Major incident”, but doing so
                                       and activating disaster plans is not always an authority given to prehospital personnel
                                       [<a href="#R26">26</a>].

                                          <p id="d1e1501">Layout of the scene has been an observed complicating factor lengthening the time
                                             between the emergency call to completion of the evacuation [<a href="#R02">2</a>, <a href="#R23">23</a>]. Making a first assessment and establishing control is more difficult if the scene
                                             is divided into natural sections that are difficult to overview, such as a railway
                                             platform [<a href="#R30">30</a>] or involving large structures like buses or trains [<a href="#R02">2</a>]. Such situations have been managed by adding to the chain of command, where arriving
                                             units are assigned geographic zones and may report to a specific commander for the
                                             area or directly to the medic in change [<a href="#R32">32</a>, <a href="#R34">34</a>, <a href="#R72">72</a>].

                                          <p id="d1e1525">In Israel, the number of “lying wounded” is used as a surrogate for seriously injured
                                             casualties [<a href="#R34">34</a>], but several environmental indicators may be used to estimate the number of casualties
                                             at the scene of a bombing. Simply identifying the place and size of the affected area
                                             together with the time of day or week, one may be able to estimate the demographics
                                             and numbers of casualties expected [<a href="#R15">15</a>]. With regard to attacks targeting buses and trains, in terms of estimating number
                                             of casualties, it is important to consider the risk of ejection from the vehicle and
                                             entrapment under it [<a href="#R54">54</a>] as there have been examples of such bombings causing some of the passengers to be
                                             ejected up to 100 meters [<a href="#R38">38</a>].

                                          <p id="d1e1539">Frykberg defined several prognostic factors affecting casualty outcome of bombings,
                                             which can be observed or estimated during the initial assessment of the scene: magnitude
                                             of explosion, urban versus isolated setting, closed space versus open-air setting
                                             of bombing, and building collapse [<a href="#R09">9</a>]. The type of bomb has different repercussions in terms of scale of destruction and
                                             likelihood of producing mass casualties. The size of the zone at risk is dependent
                                             on the type and amount of explosives, the environment, and the size of debris. Explosives
                                             hidden in a backpack are capable of producing mass casualties and causing building
                                             collapse, despite being limited in size. A car bomb, again depending on explosive
                                             type and quantity, is capable of causing destruction over a 500 m radius and may be
                                             detonated remotely or driven close to a target [<a href="#R76">76</a>]. If the explosives are carried on their person, the destructive force of a suicide
                                             bomber also limits the amount of explosives that can be used [<a href="#R20">20</a>], but the destructive force is often amplified by the use of high-grade explosives,
                                             a load of heavy shrapnel, and the additional ability of the attackers to detonate
                                             the explosive device in proximity to victims [<a href="#R75">75</a>].

                                          <p id="d1e1553">Many of the reviewed articles involve the effect of the setting on mortality and injuries
                                             of casualties in an indoor versus an open-air setting. There is some debate about
                                             what to call these settings, but the bottom line is that the more confined the space,
                                             the higher the rates of mortality [6]. Open-air (OA) bombings, e.g. in outdoor cafés
                                             or bus stops, result in fewer casualties than those detonating in a confined-space
                                             (CS) setting, in addition to having lower immediate, and late, mortality rates [<a href="#R16">16</a>, <a href="#R77">77</a>, <a href="#R78">78</a>]. Casualties of OA bombings, however, show higher rates of penetrating soft tissue
                                             injury due to shrapnel, which are mostly minor and can often be treated and released
                                             [<a href="#R79">79</a>]. While Leibovici et al. [<a href="#R80">80</a>] classified bus bombings as confined-space bombings, Kosashvili et al. [<a href="#R16">16</a>] stated that bus bombings should be further distinguished from other CS settings,
                                             such as restaurants and nightclubs. Instead, buses ought to be considered an ultra-confined
                                             space (UCS), because buses constitute a smaller confined space, leading more people
                                             to be closer to the explosion center. Furthermore, the people in the immediate vicinity
                                             of the explosion are not the only ones in danger: the more distant passengers will
                                             also be at risk of injury due to rebound amplification of the blast wave as it is
                                             reflected [<a href="#R16">16</a>, <a href="#R81">81</a>]. In Kosashvili et al.’s study of 12 consecutive suicide bombings, the bus settings
                                             led to higher rates of overall mortality compared to CS bombings in buildings and
                                             OA bombings, but smaller rates of moderate and severe injuries as more individuals
                                             were exposed to lethal pressure from the blast wave. Meanwhile, lower immediate mortality
                                             rates (16.9%) were seen in CS bombings, compared to buses (21.2%), but higher rates
                                             of moderate and severe injuries, often involving multiple systems and requiring urgent
                                             surgical treatment. Almogy et al. [<a href="#R75">75</a>] also found a difference in severity of injury between the three settings; a median
                                             number of 11, 8, and 5 casualties were in need of hospital admittance after bus, CS,
                                             and OA bombings, respectively. One may extrapolate that vehicles, such as trains and
                                             airplanes on the ground, will be similar to a bus setting, while subway trains in
                                             tunnels constitute an even more extreme setting, as they are doubly contained. In
                                             a comparison of the four scenes of the London bombings in 2005, mortality was highest
                                             and amputations were most numerous at the scene where the explosion took place in
                                             a carriage in a single tunnel [<a href="#R81">81</a>]. The highest immediate mortality rates from bombing settings have been seen in bombings
                                             that resulted in structural collapse, and people located in a collapsed region of
                                             buildings have been significantly more likely to die or require hospitalization [<a href="#R75">75</a>, <a href="#R82">82</a>]. In the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, 45% of those who perished were in the building
                                             that collapsed [<a href="#R63">63</a>].

                                          <p id="d1e1599">The scene of an attack often entails difficult working conditions, sometimes compounded
                                             by a public transportation target that adds hazards and challenges on scene, necessitating
                                             specialist training, extrication skills, and equipment for an efficient rescue [<a href="#R44">44</a>, <a href="#R45">45</a>, <a href="#R53">53</a>, <a href="#R62">62</a>]. Otherwise, surrounding hazards can delay both EMS access to victims and evacuation,
                                             in turn affecting mortality since the probability of saving critically injured victims
                                             greatly decreases with time [<a href="#R05">5</a>, <a href="#R47">47</a>, <a href="#R54">54</a>]. In connection to public transportation, hazards are fuel ignition, electrical current,
                                             and surrounding traffic; issues which need to be dealt with before rescue is started
                                             [<a href="#R30">30</a>, <a href="#R40">40</a>, <a href="#R53">53</a>]. Incidents in underground locations often entail difficult working conditions; for
                                             example, poor ventilation means airborne dust, smoke and high temperatures, lack of
                                             lighting means working by flashlight, and access to debris-filled carriages requires
                                             use of ladders [<a href="#R45">45</a>, <a href="#R62">62</a>, <a href="#R71">71</a>]. Vehicle stabilization may be required before work in train carriages or buses is
                                             initiated [<a href="#R53">53</a>], and the dynamic risk assessment needs to include re-evaluation of stability and
                                             other safety issues as responders, casualties, and equipment move around the vehicle
                                             during extrication procedures [<a href="#R44">44</a>, <a href="#R53">53</a>]. Noise caused by a large number of rescue workers can also reduce possibilities
                                             of hearing buried victims in incidents which have amounted to building collapse. Quickly
                                             cordoning off such sites and limiting personnel could thus increase likelihood of
                                             finding victims in the debris [<a href="#R83">83</a>]. Attacks occurring at sea present special prehospital challenges when rescue is
                                             additionally complicated by the vessel structure, number of passengers, isolation,
                                             distance, and limited evacuation means [<a href="#R35">35</a>]. Such incidents may also entail environmental hazards during rescue, e.g. water
                                             current, underwater obstacles, and rapid temperature loss, so personnel entering the
                                             water ought to be trained and equipped [<a href="#R53">53</a>]. Other hazards during scene management have included hot ground temperatures, high
                                             debris piles and falling debris, smoke, dust, stored gases, liquids, and ammunition

                                          <p id="d1e1691">The goal of field triage is to identify that minority of critically injured (salvageable)
                                             casualties who need immediate care, provide them with lifesaving procedures, and assign
                                             the casualty priority for further treatment [<a href="#R18">18</a>, <a href="#R32">32</a>, <a href="#R51">51</a>, <a href="#R85">85</a>] and transport, accounting for the casualties’ need for treatment at a hospital as
                                             well as considering hospital capability and capacity [<a href="#R18">18</a>, <a href="#R32">32</a>, <a href="#R85">85</a>]. In order to denote the different triage categories, numbers, colors, or symbols
                                             may be used [<a href="#R18">18</a>] on tags [<a href="#R51">51</a>] or tape [<a href="#R16">16</a>] attached to the casualty. They could also be directly drawn on with permanent marker
                                             [<a href="#R86">86</a>]. There are several different triage systems used, with two to five categories [<a href="#R20">20</a>] utilized to mark the condition of the casualty and/or priority for medical evacuation.
                                             For large-scale responses, which may require action by several EMS organizations,
                                             standardization of triage systems is important. It is not only considering choice
                                             of triage system that is important but also addressing what should be the foundation
                                             and indicator for the labeling to avoid being left up to the interpretation of each
                                             responder [<a href="#R30">30</a>, <a href="#R35">35</a>]. Many previous incidents have shown the use of a planned or improvised, simplified,
                                             two-category triage, dividing casualties into an “urgent” or “non-urgent” group [<a href="#R08">8</a>, <a href="#R35">35</a>, <a href="#R47">47</a>, <a href="#R72">72</a>, <a href="#R74">74</a>, <a href="#R87">87</a>, <a href="#R88">88</a>]. While triage into more categories is likely suitable at the ED, there may be a
                                             reason to evaluate whether a wider use of a simplified triage for MCAs is appropriate
                                             in the prehospital setting [<a href="#R08">8</a>].

                                          <p id="d1e1765">The assigned triage categories are divided into triage sites established in searched,
                                             cleared, and secured areas away from the scene, where surviving casualties and medical
                                             personnel are protected from further hostilities [<a href="#R09">9</a>, <a href="#R14">14</a>, <a href="#R34">34</a>]. The great majority of injuries suffered by immediate survivors of bombings are
                                             mostly non-life-threatening, resulting in “walking wounded” people who can be temporarily
                                             gathered, observed, and treated in a designated area together with other non-urgent
                                             casualties, while being given and supplying information [<a href="#R32">32</a>, <a href="#R34">34</a>, <a href="#R89">89</a>]. While the duration of a suitable observation period may be under question with
                                             regard to bombings, one study showed that all cases of pulmonary primary blast injury
                                             developed within 1 hour [<a href="#R15">15</a>]. A high incidence of anxiety and other-stress related phenomena often follow bombing
                                             incidents, which implies that many mildly injured patients will require psychiatric
                                             evaluation. As an emotionally traumatized person may require both medical and psychosocial
                                             support for years, substantial treatment of non-urgent casualties also constitutes
                                             a part of a good initial response [<a href="#R90">90</a>]. Achieving early site control and informing walking-wounded individuals where to
                                             go for assistance constitutes an important measure for their safety and keeps them
                                             from independently deciding where to go, resorting to “self-evacuation” [<a href="#R15">15</a>, <a href="#R20">20</a>, <a href="#R48">48</a>]. As complete use of EMS for evacuation has been rare [<a href="#R43">43</a>, <a href="#R48">48</a>, <a href="#R91">91</a>], pre-event plans should consider self-evacuation inevitable and have procedures
                                             to manage it, e.g., by preparing a separated area of treatment of mildly injured people
                                             close to the ED at the nearest hospital or by treating and releasing casualties with
                                             minor injuries gathered at the scene, or sending them to more distant hospitals, to
                                             avoid overwhelming proximal facilities [<a href="#R32">32</a>, <a href="#R87">87</a>, <a href="#R90">90</a>, <a href="#R92">92</a>]. Directing non-urgent casualties to a separate triage area allows most of the EMS
                                             work on scene to focus on those with more urgent injuries [<a href="#R20">20</a>, <a href="#R34">34</a>].

                                          <p id="d1e1833">Different types of attacks obviously result in very diverse patterns of injury and
                                             medical needs, but the focus of this study has mainly examined research related to
                                             bombings. Previous armed assaults however, have shown that gunshot victims have a
                                             higher propensity for moderate injuries compared to blast victims, as well as slightly
                                             higher inpatient mortality, which creates critical need for immediate resuscitation
                                             [<a href="#R93">93</a>]. Shootings therefore create great demands on prehospital care and rapid evacuation
                                             in order to decrease mortality of the critically injured [<a href="#R29">29</a>, <a href="#R58">58</a>]. While identification of gunshot injuries can be more straightforward [<a href="#R88">88</a>], detonation injuries may be problematic to diagnose and treat, and are uncommon
                                             in most civilian settings [<a href="#R06">6</a>, <a href="#R10">10</a>, <a href="#R11">11</a>, <a href="#R15">15</a>]. Bombings, however, constitute the most common way to perpetrate terrorist attacks
                                             [<a href="#R76">76</a>], which is why some aspects relevant for triage and treatment of blast injuries in
                                             the prehospital stage will be presented more in depth.

                                          <p id="d1e1863">A characteristic injury pattern of bomb explosions is one of a complex but often non-lethal
                                             nature, where most casualties do not require hospitalization as only a small number
                                             have severe injuries [<a href="#R09">9</a>, <a href="#R32">32</a>, <a href="#R37">37</a>, <a href="#R40">40</a>, <a href="#R57">57</a>, <a href="#R64">64</a>, <a href="#R76">76</a>, <a href="#R83">83</a>, <a href="#R91">91</a>, <a href="#R94">94</a>, <a href="#R95">95</a>, <a href="#R96">96</a>]. The vast majority of deaths from bombings usually take place at the scene or en
                                             route to the hospital, followed by few early and occasional late deaths [<a href="#R17">17</a>, <a href="#R60">60</a>, <a href="#R64">64</a>, <a href="#R97">97</a>]. In a study of 33 MCAs, Einav and colleagues [96] found that roughly a fifth (n
                                             = 236; 20.4%) of the injured were considered urgent casualties. Consequently, a large
                                             majority of surviving victims can likely be triaged and treated on an outpatient basis
                                             [<a href="#R17">17</a>, <a href="#R97">97</a>]. Medical preparedness should anticipate most injuries from bombings to be nonfatal
                                             secondary and tertiary blast injuries [<a href="#R09">9</a>, <a href="#R10">10</a>, <a href="#R45">45</a>, <a href="#R82">82</a>, <a href="#R97">97</a>]. Personnel responding to the scene of a high-explosive detonation will be confronted
                                             mostly with injuries comprising conventional blunt, penetrating, and thermal trauma,
                                             but they need to be wary of the less common, potentially life-threatening primary
                                             blast injuries, which may present subtly or delayed [<a href="#R15">15</a>]. Even with no detectable external trauma, there is a risk of primary blast injuries,
                                             e.g. to the lungs or bowels. This needs to be considered, especially in casualties
                                             categorized as non-urgent [<a href="#R12">12</a>, <a href="#R34">34</a>, <a href="#R80">80</a>, <a href="#R83">83</a>, <a href="#R97">97</a>, <a href="#R98">98</a>].

                                          <p id="d1e1960">Trauma after explosions is often divided into primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary
                                             injuries [<a href="#R09">9</a>, <a href="#R15">15</a>, <a href="#R85">85</a>]. Primary blast injury (PBI) occurs as a direct effect of changes in atmospheric
                                             pressure caused by a blast wave, mainly injuring gas-containing organ systems, notably
                                             the middle ear, the lungs, and the bowel [<a href="#R15">15</a>]. Blast lung injury (BLI) is not the most common injury, but it causes the greatest
                                             morbidity and late mortality from blast effect and may be complicated by pneumothoraces
                                             or hemothoraces [<a href="#R48">48</a>, <a href="#R99">99</a>]. Early recognition of BLI may improve outcome by directing patients to an appropriate
                                             level of care and initiating early treatment [<a href="#R78">78</a>]. Clinical signs and symptoms of BLI include dyspnea, chest pain, hemoptysis, hypoxia,
                                             and/or wheezing [<a href="#R48">48</a>]. Abdominal blast injuries are rare, but if the casualty displays clinical signs
                                             such as nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain, they need to be aggressively treated,
                                             with serial abdominal examinations and nothing given by mouth [<a href="#R09">9</a>, <a href="#R48">48</a>].

                                          <p id="d1e1993">A long-cherished belief among rescuers has been the examination of the tympanic membrane
                                             to quickly triage victims for other primary blast injuries [<a href="#R100">100</a>], but several studies [<a href="#R13">13</a>, <a href="#R77">77</a>, <a href="#R101">101</a>] have shown that tympanic membrane rupture (TMR) is neither a reliable predictor
                                             of other PBI, nor a reliable method of diagnosis. Presence of a perforated eardrum
                                             may indicate exposure to significant overpressure, warranting evaluation; however,
                                             the absence of eardrum rupture does not exclude the person from being at risk of other
                                             PBI [<a href="#R13">13</a>, <a href="#R14">14</a>, <a href="#R99">99</a>, <a href="#R101">101</a>]. A study of 647 terrorist bombing survivors showed that all casualties with BLIs
                                             had a fully developed clinical picture in the first hour after admission and that
                                             intestinal blast injury were rare and typically associated with other severe injuries
                                             [<a href="#R13">13</a>]. Secondary blast injuries (SBI) occur when objects accelerated by the energy of
                                             the explosion strike a victim, often causing the most numerous injuries from blunt
                                             or penetrating ballistic trauma [<a href="#R14">14</a>, <a href="#R15">15</a>, <a href="#R17">17</a>]. Tertiary blast injuries (TBI) can be viewed as the converse of SBI; the missile
                                             is stationary and the victim is propelled by expanding gases from high winds, resulting
                                             in a high incidence of blunt trauma from tumbling and impacting objects [15,98]. Quaternary
                                             injuries often imply injuries due to delayed causes such as crush injuries from building
                                             collapse or inhalation and burns from secondary fires [<a href="#R27">27</a>, <a href="#R48">48</a>, <a href="#R76">76</a>, <a href="#R79">79</a>]. Due to several injury mechanisms, explosions can cause a multiplicity and variety
                                             of injuries to several regions of the body in a single individual, referred to as
                                             a multi-dimensional injury [<a href="#R70">70</a>, <a href="#R83">83</a>, <a href="#R85">85</a>, <a href="#R92">92</a>, <a href="#R102">102</a>].

                                          <p id="d1e2061">The anatomic site and nature of injury constitute some important prognostic factors
                                             among bombing victims [<a href="#R09">9</a>]. Traumatic amputation of limbs caused by bomb blast carries a high mortality and
                                             thus has often been seen as an indication of fatality [<a href="#R38">38</a>, <a href="#R81">81</a>]. However, in the 2005 London bombings, nearly one-fourth (24.5%) of those with traumatic
                                             amputations survived [<a href="#R81">81</a>]. Thus, it has been held that blast injuries associated with late death such as primary
                                             limb amputation, open-long bone fractures, abdominal injuries, chest injuries, and
                                             blast lung injury, should instead be given priority in triage [<a href="#R09">9</a>, <a href="#R97">97</a>]. During the chaotic circumstances after an attack, it may be difficult for EMS to
                                             determine levels of consciousness and signs of life such as pulse and blood pressure.
                                             Almogy et al. [<a href="#R78">78</a>] therefore proposed some easily recognizable external signs of trauma after bombings,
                                             to ease triage of BLI and to help EMS distinguish salvageable from non-salvageable
                                             casualties. From their study of 15 suicide bombings, they found that patients with
                                             skull fractures, burns covering more than 10% of the body surface area (BSA), and
                                             penetrating wounds to the head and torso, were more likely to suffer from BLI and
                                             require advanced trauma care. The presence of amputations, open fractures, and burns
                                             (covering more than 30% of BSA) was significantly higher in fatally injured people.
                                             If combined with no sign of life, these should be categorized as “unsalvageable”,
                                             according to Almogy et al. [<a href="#R78">78</a>]. Almogy et al. later showed that casualties with penetrating head injuries and those
                                             with more than 4 body areas injured were significantly more likely to suffer from
                                             BLI. As for intra-abdominal injuries, they were more likely in casualties with penetrating
                                             torso injuries and those with more than 4 body areas injured. Based on this, they
                                             moved to simplify EMS triage further by focusing on vital signs and the number of
                                             regions injured, where more than 4 injured body regions implied transfer to a Level

                                          <p id="d1e2094">There are two main approaches to providing prehospital care to trauma victims: Basic
                                             Life Support (BLS) treatment and rapid evacuation techniques (formerly referred to
                                             as “Scoop and Run”); and Advanced Life Support (ALS) on scene, prior to transport
                                             (formerly referred to as “Stay and Play”) [<a href="#R104">104</a>]. The choice of whether to give advanced treatment on site and establish collections
                                             points versus quickly transferring patients to hospitals is based on the prevailing
                                             conditions, mostly affected by proximity to hospitals and the availability of transportation.
                                             Generally, this means that the ALS is recommended in rural areas while the BLS is
                                             executed in urban areas [<a href="#R07">7</a>]. It has repeatedly been observed that by the time medical staff from the hospitals
                                             are at their highest number at the scene and assembly points have been established,
                                             the most seriously injured have already been transported to the hospitals [<a href="#R68">68</a>]. According to Kluger [<a href="#R85">85</a>], definitive care by well-trained physicians in well-equipped facilities has a higher
                                             impact on patient outcome than care on scene. Setting up field hospitals and sending
                                             mobile teams from hospitals to provide advanced treatment on scene is an alternative
                                             when there is not enough prehospital staff, when casualties are trapped, when appropriate
                                             hospitals are far away, or where limited transport facilities cause a delay in evacuation
                                             [<a href="#R55">55</a>, <a href="#R70">70</a>, <a href="#R83">83</a>, <a href="#R105">105</a>]. There have also been instances were physicians have been beneficial on the scene
                                             by enabling extrication and transfer to hospital, sometimes through field amputations
                                             [<a href="#R57">57</a>, <a href="#R60">60</a>, <a href="#R63">63</a>]. Mostly though, researchers [<a href="#R31">31</a>, <a href="#R57">57</a>, <a href="#R59">59</a>] have concluded that physicians and nurses are not suitable for incident sites if
                                             they are untrained and unprepared to work in a suboptimal and dangerous prehospital
                                             environment because the risk to them is big, while the benefits are small. To provide
                                             meaningful assistance at the scene, personnel ought to be trained, organized, and
                                             have clear assignments in order to understand the workings of emergency services and
                                             be familiar with the pre-hospital environment [<a href="#R42">42</a>, <a href="#R45">45</a>, <a href="#R47">47</a>, <a href="#R62">62</a>]. The expertise of physicians and nurses may be of better use at the hospital, as
                                             individuals perform best when executing an extension of their normal work, where facilities
                                             and equipment are familiar [<a href="#R39">39</a>, <a href="#R59">59</a>, <a href="#R88">88</a>]. The importance of training prehospital responders in the specifics of antagonistic
                                             attacks and general MCI management has also been highlighted to assure that they work
                                             with adapted procedures for mass casualties and have knowledge in management of blast
                                             injuries [<a href="#R55">55</a>].

                                             “freelancers” and other volunteers; people approaching the scene or hospitals on their
                                             own initiative [<a href="#R40">40</a>, <a href="#R45">45</a>, <a href="#R47">47</a>, <a href="#R49">49</a>, <a href="#R57">57</a>, <a href="#R64">64</a>, <a href="#R84">84</a>, <a href="#R106">106</a>]. This has sometimes been discouraged and at other times encouraged, highlighting
                                             the importance of incorporating bystander response in response plans and training
                                             [<a href="#R20">20</a>, <a href="#R29">29</a>, <a href="#R59">59</a>]. In Israel, educated and trained lay bystanders are considered frontline first responders

                                             resuscitation, constitute a prognostic factor for survival. It is imperative that
                                             medical staff check their instincts to deliver as much care as needed to each victim
                                             while in a mass casualty setting [<a href="#R32">32</a>, <a href="#R50">50</a>]. Instead, triage and treatment in MCAs often necessitate a battlefield mentality,
                                             using damage-control principles where minimally required care is provided to the maximum

                                             to treat them sufficiently so that they reach the hospital alive [<a href="#R06">6</a>, <a href="#R32">32</a>, <a href="#R38">38</a>].

                                             control, exchanging the traditional ABC mnemonic (for airway, breathing, circulation)
                                             with MARCH: Massive Hemorrhage Control/Airway Support/Respiratory Threats/Circulation/Hypothermia
                                             [<a href="#R29">29</a>]. However, the extent of treatment, and what procedures should be carried out in
                                             the area of explosion or shooting, is incongruent or unclearly described in the included
                                             studies. Some hold that external hemorrhage control should be the only procedure conducted
                                             before casualties are taken to a designated safe zone [5,70]. Others, hold that initial
                                             on-scene treatment should follow fundamental resuscitation protocols including spinal
                                             immobilization (c-spine), opening of obstructed airway (chin-lift maneuver), and control
                                             of breathing, while all other treatments are deferred to the next survey [<a href="#R32">32</a>, <a href="#R34">34</a>, <a href="#R48">48</a>]. The main thing is that a minimum of emergency forces provide a minimum of procedures
                                             on an unsecure site, holding off the majority of staff and treatment on scene at established
                                             safe areas. With regard to field medical care, Stein and Hirshberg [<a href="#R99">99</a>] concluded that airway with C-spine had probably saved the most salvageable casualties
                                             after terrorist explosions. Oxygenation may be monitored using pulse oximetry and,
                                             if necessary, improved by oxygen via mask and a rebreathing reservoir [<a href="#R48">48</a>, <a href="#R99">99</a>]. Needle insertion to relieve pneumothoraces may also be prudent [<a href="#R38">38</a>, <a href="#R48">48</a>, <a href="#R99">99</a>], and tracheal intubation may be performed if the patient’s pulmonary status deteriorates
                                             [<a href="#R34">34</a>, <a href="#R48">48</a>]. Treatment of air embolism is supported by placing the casualty in the Trendelenburg
                                             and left-lateral-decubitus position [<a href="#R48">48</a>]. Alignment and stabilization of fractures is another important treatment in the
                                             field. Covering open wounds, where possible, is also helpful/desirable [<a href="#R48">48</a>, <a href="#R99">99</a>]. Limbs that have experienced crush injuries may need to be splinted, and at an early
                                             stage severe crush injuries may be treated with IV fluids to help minimize the complications
                                             from rhabdomyolysis [<a href="#R48">48</a>]. One important cause of coagulopathy in trauma patients is hypothermia, the risk
                                             for which may be reduced by covering wounds [<a href="#R34">34</a>] and generally protecting casualties from the elements. Burns ought to be covered
                                             with a clean dressing, and IV fluids should be started for burns covering large BSA
                                             [<a href="#R48">48</a>]. The Modified Brooke formula may be better for the management of burns as the use

                                             the risk of gradual deterioration in casualties with burns, threatening limbs which
                                             were previously well perfused which underlines the need for continuous assessment

                                             thus include application of tourniquet to control extremity hemorrhage, hemostatic
                                             dressings to control bleeding from sites not amenable to a tourniquet, and “Sit up

                                             result in either airway obstruction or bleeding into the airway) [<a href="#R29">29</a>]. Support for tourniquet use was indicted in a study from the response to the 2005
                                             London bombings as all the patients with amputations, except one, who were admitted

                                             although transient symptoms of stress are common after experiences of mass violence
                                             [<a href="#R36">36</a>]. Early mental health assessment and intervention does not focus on providing “psychological
                                             forms of treatment” but rather down-to-earth and practical provision of basic services

                                             safety, providing food, shelter and medical assistance, mental health triage, and

                                             support for those most distressed, keeping families together, and facilitating reunions

                                             needs have been met, they usually want answers; a shortage of accurate information
                                             is potentially traumatic and harmful if wild rumors result in panic or deprivation

                                             to obtain information from the victim in order to maximize the possibility of apprehending
                                             the perpetrator(s), prevent further violence, and plan for aiding other potential
                                             victims [<a href="#R89">89</a>]. Responders are in a unique position to help victims deal with the impact of their
                                             ordeal by helping them restore a sense of safety and control, e.g. by providing a

                                             help balance concerns for victim welfare and the need to obtain detailed information.
                                             Integrating them into responses to MCAs could therefore prove wise during pre-event

                                             activities, EMS personnel therefore need to reduce the activity level of potential

                                             algorithm with changes to the performance of triage in children due to the difficulties

                                             in children, and due to different mechanisms of injury in children because of their
                                             physiological and anatomical characteristics. For further details please see original

                                             are rare, prehospital personnel may have difficulties performing certain clinical
                                             procedures such as intubation or establishing an intravenous line. It has therefore
                                             been recommended that only simple life-saving procedures such as opening an airway
                                             or maintaining ventilation should be performed for children at the scene of an MCA.
                                             Other procedures should be postponed until the child’s arrival to the ED. Optimally,
                                             children should be evacuated to a hospital with pediatric capabilities, but if they
                                             have critical injuries they may need to be stabilized at the nearest hospital first.
                                             If possible, it is also advisable that EMS staff find a familiar adult to keep the
                                             child company to the hospital during such a stressful event, but not if it results
                                             in significant delay in patient evacuation [<a href="#R19">19</a>]. Emotional trauma, e.g., due to separation from parents, is a critical factor during
                                             pediatric care, which implies that it is vital to identify children assigned to the
                                             “delayed care” category with anxiety and acute emotional stress and provide them with
                                             psychosocial support [<a href="#R18">18</a>]. Letting children help with small maneuvers, like undressing to allow examination,
                                             may be helpful for restoring their sense of control in an otherwise disorienting situation

                                             or triage, responders have to consider that they are more susceptible to hypothermia

                                             among the rescue teams have also led medical teams to miss groups of casualties, delaying
                                             their care [<a href="#R02">2</a>].

                                          <p id="d1e2529">Road congestion has made it difficult to get both to and from the scene [<a href="#R40">40</a>, <a href="#R66">66</a>], occasionally exacerbated by rescue service, security, or police forces blocking
                                             entrance of EMS to the scene [<a href="#R02">2</a>, <a href="#R33">33</a>, <a href="#R61">61</a>] and other times alleviated through police establishment of designated evacuation
                                             routes to the hospitals [<a href="#R32">32</a>, <a href="#R47">47</a>, <a href="#R65">65</a>, <a href="#R70">70</a>]. Targeting public transportation infrastructure, like subways and buses, can aggravate
                                             obstructions to medical evacuation, preventing medical staff from reaching their post
                                             and discharged patients from clearing the hospital [<a href="#R62">62</a>, <a href="#R111">111</a>]. Ways to adapt to road congestion include pre-planned deployment of paramedics on
                                             bicycles; using helicopters to move doctors, equipment, and casualties; and sending
                                             nurses onto main roads to triage people seeking medical care [<a href="#R62">62</a>, <a href="#R65">65</a>, <a href="#R71">71</a>].

                                             vehicles and helicopters [<a href="#R72">72</a>]. Such accessibility difficulties may result in inefficient convergence of ambulances
                                             on the incident scene, forcing them to wait in queue at a distance from the scene

                                          <p id="d1e2589">A determinant of mortality among victims of antagonistic attacks is the availability
                                             of medical resources at the scene and the prehospital system of transport and care.
                                             Longer times for rescue and transport to definitive care, from isolated areas, tends
                                             to result in higher mortality rates [<a href="#R09">9</a>]. The distance to definitive care and available means of transportation, from urban
                                             or rural incident scenes, require different approaches in terms of the degree of prehospital
                                             care on site versus transfer and care at an appropriate medical facility. Pinkert
                                             et al. [<a href="#R95">95</a>] concluded, that when an MCA affects an urban area, in the vicinity of several hospitals,
                                             the best course of action involved rapid arrival of a large number of ambulances,
                                             rapid primary triage, use of evacuation priorities, and rapid distribution of casualties
                                             among all nearby hospitals in the area. Such a response requires synchronization of
                                             the EMS response and appropriate distribution of casualties to hospitals [<a href="#R66">66</a>, <a href="#R95">95</a>]. As most attacks occur in an urban setting [<a href="#R34">34</a>], rapid evacuation will be suitable in most cases, but when attacks occur in rural
                                             areas, there may be limited EMS and small, local hospitals with fewer resources, and
                                             limited abilities to cope with a large number of injured people [<a href="#R106">106</a>]. Such responses may require the use of other modes of transportation for medical
                                             evacuation, transfer of staff and equipment, higher degrees of treatment on site,
                                             or use of local hospitals as casualty collection points, dependent on their capabilities.

                                          <p id="d1e2610">Helicopters and fixed-wing aircrafts have been essential to deploy staff and equipment
                                             to the site or primary receiving hospitals [<a href="#R37">37</a>, <a href="#R45">45</a>, <a href="#R105">105</a>, <a href="#R112">112</a>], as well as use for primary or secondary evacuation and distribution of injured
                                             [<a href="#R37">37</a>, <a href="#R105">105</a>, <a href="#R112">112</a>]. Improvements in air evacuation have significantly upgraded the ability of the EMS
                                             to rapidly evacuate MCA casualties in distant areas to tertiary care facilities, but
                                             effective use of air-medical evacuation requires planning, coordination, and training
                                             [<a href="#R112">112</a>]. It is also a mode of transportation sensitive to the weather conditions, thus not
                                             necessarily serviceable when needed [<a href="#R93">93</a>]. Coordination of helicopters have been challenging due to poor weather conditions,
                                             uncontrolled airspace, unsettled safety settings, and unsuitable placement of casualty
                                             clearing stations [<a href="#R42">42</a>]. To facilitate air-medical evacuation, incident command ought to gather and transmit
                                             information regarding landing zone characteristics and severity of injuries prior
                                             to reaching the site, possibly by assigning an Air Support Manager [<a href="#R112">112</a>]. While air-medical evacuation can be a suitable option for incidents at sea, it
                                             may also entail difficulties depending on the vessel’s size: there is not always space
                                             to land and the use of a rescue hoist is time consuming. Winds from rotors risk blowing

                                          <p id="d1e2668">Like other mass-casualty incidents, distribution of casualties to appropriate health
                                             care facilities is one of the most important issues after MCAs [<a href="#R104">104</a>], as bed availability, capability to manage specific injuries, and potential for
                                             casualty transfer is vital to ensure good patient care [<a href="#R04">4</a>]. Distribution of casualties however, has been problematic after several MCAs [<a href="#R02">2</a>, <a href="#R17">17</a>, <a href="#R28">28</a>, <a href="#R66">66</a>]. Optimal distribution of casualties is hinged upon well-established local command
                                             and communications with the receiving hospitals, facilitated through preparation [<a href="#R06">6</a>]. From two MCAs, Rodoplu et al. [<a href="#R17">17</a>, <a href="#R28">28</a>] found that maldistribution seemed associated with distance from the scene, type
                                             of medical facility, personal preference of survivors, lack of central coordination
                                             of ambulances, and lack of field triage.
                                          </p>
                                          <p id="d1e2698">A common issue after urban MCAs has been the hospital nearest to the site becoming
                                             overwhelmed [<a href="#R20">20</a>, <a href="#R30">30</a>, <a href="#R60">60</a>, <a href="#R94">94</a>]. This is largely due to the common phenomena known as self-evacuation or self-triage,
                                             where people with minor injuries make their own way to the hospital [<a href="#R29">29</a>, <a href="#R61">61</a>, <a href="#R85">85</a>], aided by non-medical vehicles [<a href="#R27">27</a>, <a href="#R30">30</a>, <a href="#R63">63</a>, <a href="#R67">67</a>, <a href="#R68">68</a>, <a href="#R74">74</a>, <a href="#R87">87</a>, <a href="#R94">94</a>, <a href="#R113">113</a>]. This results in an early arrival pattern of mild casualties who can be treated
                                             and released, while ambulances carrying the more severely injured and casualties requiring
                                             extrication arrive later [<a href="#R15">15</a>, <a href="#R32">32</a>, <a href="#R44">44</a>, <a href="#R64">64</a>, <a href="#R87">87</a>, <a href="#R94">94</a>]. Similar patterns may also arise if minor injured people are assembled and transferred
                                             to the hospital by bus, as this can be achieved more quickly than the medical evacuation
                                             of more severely injured people [64]. If evacuation of minor injured people is controlled,
                                             it is more suitable to evacuate them to a more distant hospital, and if arrival of
                                             patients is not controlled and the hospital is overwhelmed, it may be necessary for
                                             it to function as a casualty collection point, triaging between high-acuity and low-acuity
                                             casualties, and secondarily transporting some to more distant facilities [<a href="#R48">48</a>, <a href="#R111">111</a>]. Despite the pattern of the closest hospital often being overwhelmed, recommendations
                                             and practice from several incidents have been to evacuate all patients with immediate,
                                             life-threatening injuries to the closest hospital for evaluation and stabilization
                                             [<a href="#R87">87</a>, <a href="#R95">95</a>, <a href="#R96">96</a>, <a href="#R104">104</a>]. Meanwhile, casualty-clearing stations may be used to treat those with minor injuries
                                             on site [<a href="#R68">68</a>], providing Advanced Life Support (ALS) until they can be evacuated directly to a
                                             suitable facility [<a href="#R104">104</a>].

                                          <p id="d1e2795">Another approach [<a href="#R87">87</a>, <a href="#R106">106</a>] is to evacuate all casualties to the hospital closest to the site for advanced,
                                             hospital-based resuscitation. The principle of an evacuation hospital (or “triage
                                             hospital”) has been recommended when the needs of the patients greatly outweigh the
                                             capabilities of the receiving hospital or when the expected number of patients amount
                                             to a continued patient flow. This sets the hospital to a mode of treating and discharging
                                             mild casualties while stabilizing, and secondarily evacuating, patients that require
                                             admission [<a href="#R37">37</a>, <a href="#R105">105</a>].

                              <p id="d1e2812">In this review of 105 articles regarding response challenges on scene of a mass-casualty
                                 attack, difficulties were found corresponding to each prioritized task, as defined
                                 in the MIMMS framework. Two aspects of importance, not equally highlighted in the
                                 original framework, were functional coordination and collaboration, as well as the
                                 influence of the environment. While the former has been noted in analysis of previous
                                 responses to unintentional incidents, the significance of setting, noted during scene
                                 assessment, is especially vital during bombings. It is not only vital in estimating
                                 the number of direct fatalities and injured, but also as an indicator for possible
                                 injuries and needs for equipment and specialist care. Besides issues related to the
                                 “assessment task”, other specific challenges in MCA management, compared to unintentional
                                 incidents, were particularly clear in relation to safety, triage, and treatment. Meanwhile,
                                 problems related to command, coordination, and communication were the most commonly
                                 reported, showing the overlap in management of unintentional and intentional incidents.
                                 Hence, experience in dealing with unintentional incidents may prepare responders for
                                 challenges with command, coordination, and communication, whereas specific challenges
                                 with safety, assessment, triage, and treatment would remain foreign. Many of the included
                                 articles claim that preparedness for MCAs thus require planning and specific training
                                 [<a href="#R05">5</a>, <a href="#R06">6</a>, <a href="#R32">32</a>, <a href="#R53">53</a>, <a href="#R62">62</a>, <a href="#R73">73</a>, <a href="#R91">91</a>, <a href="#R95">95</a>, <a href="#R96">96</a>, <a href="#R104">104</a>]. It may be inferred that if inter-organizational collaboration is to be more offensive
                                 [<a href="#R05">5</a>, <a href="#R29">29</a>, <a href="#R58">58</a>], these preparatory efforts will be even more vital. In relation to preparatory efforts,
                                 Vidali and Hutchens [<a href="#R114">114</a>] stressed that fragmentation between crisis management and public safety system actors
                                 often constitute a hindrance to readiness measurements and capability aggregation.
                                 They further highlight the need to distinguish between capacity (quantifiable assets
                                 such as equipment, vehicles and radios) and capability (qualitative measurements of
                                 e.g. skills, training and coordination). If the resources are to be ready for use,
                                 both aspects need to be accounted for, and failing to do so could amount to poor investment
                                 decisions. Examples of such investment were observed by López-Carresi [<a href="#R30">30</a>] after the Madrid bombings, where the Madrid-based EMS decided to purchase more mobile
                                 telephones even though scarcity of transmission equipment had not been the cause of
                                 communication failures. Clearly, what is needed to increase preparedness depends on
                                 the context, but as López-Carresi pointed out, there is often a reluctance to make
                                 deep structural or system changes (which may be interpreted as criticism of the current
                                 system), as opposed to adjustments of the existing work schemes (which may be seen
                                 as previous lack of funding or other resources). Effectively increasing readiness
                                 for MCAs will thus likely entail struggles to overcome fragmentation between the police,
                                 rescue service, EMS and the broader crisis management system, as well as enabling
                                 critical and prestige-less assessments of needed preparatory efforts.

                              <p id="d1e2861">Regarding the strength of evidence of the management challenges, articles related
                                 to direct and indirect threats to safety on scene, [<a href="#R56">56</a>] and issues concerning blast injuries with implications during assessment, triage,
                                 and treatment had higher scientific quality [<a href="#R10">10</a>, <a href="#R11">11</a>, <a href="#R79">79</a>, <a href="#R81">81</a>, <a href="#R101">101</a>]. The scientific quality of the articles varied, partly due to the difficulties of
                                 studying an issue where circumstances and occurrence cannot be foretold or controlled
                                 (effecting study design). It was also partly due to the limitations of this study-
                                 as a result of the inclusion and exclusion criteria used to achieve the study’s aim
                                 (effecting eligibility). If one were to search more databases, or additionally include
                                 studies based on simulations and relating to unintentional incidents, some findings
                                 may have been made more robust. In order to be feasible, one would have had to focus
                                 such a study on a specific prioritized task on scene and/or the perspective of only
                                 one responder group. This study instead lays the basis for such studies in the future
                                 and includes valuable issues of consideration for personnel within the EMS, police,
                                 and rescue service. The inclusion of articles of lower scientific quality and the
                                 breadth of the review may imply limitations for practical use. However, it is not
                                 meant as a guideline for how incident management should be conducted everywhere, since
                                 incident response needs to be adapted to local incident management systems, resources,
                                 and expectations. One cannot simply cut and paste a system onto another; however,
                                 reoccurring bottlenecks can be learned from other countries, and appropriate adjustments
                                 for dealing with such issues can be made in accordance with the structure of systems
