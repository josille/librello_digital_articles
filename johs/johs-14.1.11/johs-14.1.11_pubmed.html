            </p>
            <p id="d1e82">With this scenario in mind, the book edited by Paul J. Carnegie, Victor T. King, Zawawi
               Ibrahim (respectively, Professors at University of South Pacific, Fiji, and the two
               latter from Universiti Brunei Darussalam, Brunei) provides a broad analysis of the
               specificities of human insecurities in Southeast Asia. Moreover, the manuscript develops
               a comprehensive multilevel view on the challenges and risks towards a just society
               in that region. The book comprises the main works presented at an ASEAN (Association
               of Southeast Asian Nations) inter-university seminar held in Brunei Darussalam in
               December 2012.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e84">The book is divided in eleven chapters and a conclusion, covering all Southeast Asian
               countries, as well as the role of ASEAN in promoting human security in the region.
               The Introduction (also Chapter 1) provides a literature review of the human security
               concept, as well as acknowledging its complexity and limitations. Authored by the
               editors, chapter 1 also delivers a broad overview of Southeast Asia’s challenges in
               a multidisciplinary approach. Moreover, they also summarize the importance of the
               topic when they point out that “the juxtaposition of fantastic wealth generation against
               the ubiquitous and pervasive banality of poverty and vulnerability in Southeast Asia
               is what renders ‘human insecurities’ simultaneously almost invisible but glaringly
               obvious” (p. 3).
            </p>
            <p id="d1e86">Chapter 2 is a continuation of the conceptual discussion started in the Introduction,
               in which Victor King contributes a theoretical review on uncertainty, risk, security
               and trust offered by some classical works in the social sciences. While the human
               security concept is relatively new, its roots can be found in the works of eminent
               thinkers like E.P. Thompson, Zygmunt Bauman, Karl Marx and others. In some way, all
               of them discussed the human condition and insecurities of modernity—and post-modernity—that
               are the concern of Mahbub’ul Haq and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP)
               who first addressed concepts of human security.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e88">A very important issue discussed in two chapters of the book are human (in)securities
               of indigenous peoples in Southeast Asia. Specificially, chapter 3 authored by Zawawi
               Ibrahim brings a discussion about deterritorialization of the Orang Asli and the Penan
               in Malaysia. His study shows the importance of local specificities in human security
               analysis, as well as the impacts of deterritorialization on the level of culture—as
               seen in the song composed by a Orang Asli described on page 33. Moreover, his ethnography
               urges the reader to reflect on the link how between human security and debates in
               development. Similarly regarding the (in)security of indigenous peoples, chapter 11
               by Eliseo Huesca Jr. shows the challenges caused by the expansion of agribusiness
               in Mindanao. Although the Philippine export trade has improved over the last few years
               due to the exportation of commodities, at the same time the exploration of rural areas
               has impacted negatively on the natural environment causing environmental degradation,
               poverty and social inequality. Furthermore, Huesca Jr’s investigation provides a clear
               picture of the pervasive effects of land grabbing, an issue affecting the Global South
               that often is a driver for poverty and inequality in rural areas worldwide.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e90">Similarly to chapter 3, another important input grounded in ethnography is provided
               in chapter 6. Authored by A. Ullah, Y.M. Yusof-Koslowski and M. D’Aria, the chapter
               is well structured and offers a comprehensive examination of female migrants in Southeast
               Asia. Based on 94 interviews, this unique research focuses on three different phases
               of migration: premigration, enroute and postmigration. The unsafe experiences of migrants
               are illustrated in the sorrowful findings of the researchers. For example, interviews
               revealed that 63% of migrants were sexually abused enroute and 36% threated by traffickers.
               Unfortunately these data do not differ from similar analyses of other regions, as
               can be seen from the flow of Latin Americans to the United States and Africans to
               Europe. A gap to be filled by future research could be comparing the findings of Ullah
               et. al. with results of these other regions. Most probably similar patters can be
               found in this issue that weaken human security across the world.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e92">Responses to cross-border terrorism and traditional security concerns are the topics
               of two other Chapters. Authored by Paul J. Carnegie, chapter 4 concerns the historical
               tension between Indonesian government and Islamic militants, mainly after the Bali
               terrorist attacks in 2002. In chapter 5, Gordon Carson analyses how the promotion
               of ‘national security’ by Malaysia does not necessarily facilitate human security
               on the coast of Sabah. Also applying ethnographic methodology, Carson’s contribution
               aims to grasp the challenges for human security due to the action of states and its
               security forces. His findings make the reader reflect on the difficulty of reaching
               some of the targets of Sustainable Development Goals (e.g., Objective 16—Peace and
               Justice and Strong Institutions) while the traditional concept of sovereignty remains
               strong.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e94">Taking the analysis to the level of regional organizations, chapters 7 and 10 focus
               on the ASEAN’s attempt to accommodate the notion of human security. Differently from
               the other chapters that focused on local or state issues, Mikio Oishi discusses in
               chapter 7 the political spaces created by ASEAN that facilitate a discussion of human
               rights. In Chapter 10, Ta-Wei Chu demonstrates how difficult is the process for ASEAN
               to become more people-oriented. Nevertheless the challenges described by Oishi and
               Chu, that state-centrism within ASEAN is no different from other regional organizations
               that are dealing with human insecurities, like the Union of South American Nations
               (UNASUR). Here again it would be welcomed to read in the near future comparative analyses
               of regions that face similar challenges as currently experienced by Southeast Asia.
               
            </p>
            <p id="d1e96">Finally, two other chapters offer important case studies from the Philippines and
               Thailand. In chapter 8 Rommel Curaming offers a historical perspective of the conflict
               in Muslim Mindanao, with special attention to the violence promoted by the state and
               colonial powers since the 16th century. Following that chapter, Nicham Singhaputargum
               analyses the civil society movements in Thailand, especially after 2001 with the rising
               of Thaksin Shinawatra. Both cases presented in those Chapters bring to attention the
               question of structural violence, a concept coined by sociologist Johan Galtung that
               refers to a situation in which the insecurity is embedded in the structure of the
               social system.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e98">Some important issues could be covered more accurately in the book, such as the effects
               of the 1997 crisis, human trafficking and the effects of climate change (natural disasters).
               However, these shortcomings do not affect the quality of the analysis presented in
               this book. It presents a compelling overview of human insecurities in Southeast Asia,
               highlighted by the extensive use of ethnography and historical analysis. Surely, this
               is an important reading for academics and students concerned with the region and even
               useful for comparative analysis with other continents.
