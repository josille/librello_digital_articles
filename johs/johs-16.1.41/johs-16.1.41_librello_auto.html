                                 attempts to preserve ecology and the natural environment have a relatively short history.
                                 Anthropogenic environmental changes in many cases have a direct impact on one's quality
                                 of life and the functioning of urban centers, states and communities. Pressure exerted
                                 by human economic activity on the environment is demonstrated, above all, by reductions
                                 in air, water, and soil quality, worse acoustic climate, and limited access to green
                                 spaces. The most detrimental undertakings have a negative impact on the level of ecological
                                 security in cities are transport, domestic heating of buildings, industrial activities,
                                 and heating processes. The main goal of this paper is to identify the perception of
                                 the ecological security of the residents of the biggest urban centers. Urban environment
                                 security is a very broad issue. It covers both natural phenomena, where human impact
                                 is minimal, levels of urban sustainable development and attitudes of the city dwellers.
                                 Recently, citizen awareness of the importance of environmental challenges in Polish
                                 cities’ development has surged, including awareness of the desire to live in a cleaner
                                 environment and to breathe clean air. The topic is more and more often discussed in
                                 public debate, above all during periods of peak contaminant concentrations. The situation
                                 serves as a stimulus for citizens to mobilize, often through various social movements
                                 while local governments take actions oriented at changing methods of domestic heating,
                                 more eco-friendly mobility and the enhanced environmental education of society.</span></div>

                                 growth, population ageing, and international migration, constitutes one of the four
                                 demographic mega-trends [<a href="#R1">1</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e78">Due to the density of population and building development, natural disasters and anthropogenic
                                 environmental hazards are much more dangerous for the cities than for non-urban areas.
                                 A concentration of anthropogenic pollution (air pollution, acoustic climate, and municipal
                                 solid waste) is a great problem in urban areas. Moreover, the development of cities
                                 generates multiple environmental problems in rural areas, such as decreasing quantities
                                 of arable land, or water, soil, and air pollution [<a href="#R2">2</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e83">Due to their chronic nature, air pollution and noise are recognised as one of the
                                 greatest environmental issues in cities. Those undesirable phenomena may be limited
                                 only partially by physical barriers. Therefore, they affect areas such as residential
                                 zones, schools [<a href="#R3">3</a>], health centres, and other public utility facilities. Long-term exposure to noise
                                 is related to multiple health problems, including coronary artery disease [<a href="#R4">4</a>], myocardial infarction, irritation among people with poor quality of sleep, diabetes,
                                 decreased understanding of written text, and decreased focus among children at school
                                 age [<a href="#R5">5</a>]. According to the publication by the World Health Organization, at least 100 million
                                 people in the EU are exposed to road noise and at least 1.6 million years of healthy
                                 life is lost each year [<a href="#R6">6</a>]. In Poland, that issue is particularly important and concerns two areas of human
                                 activity. Firstly, excessive noise levels and air pollution are results of using increasingly
                                 older vehicles and the growing rate of motorization [<a href="#R7">7</a>]. Secondly, public utilities in many Polish cities are still based on fossil fuels,
                                 in particular coal. According to the report by the European Environment Agency, the
                                 greatest problem for air quality understood as the general composition of atmosphere
                                 with additives in a specific place and time is the pollution with particular matter

                                 over 47 thousand people in Poland. In recent years, air quality norms have been exceeded
                                 virtually all over Poland. The standard levels for PM10 have been exceeded in 91%

                                 of the city is anthropogenic activity. Pressure exerted by human economic activity
                                 on the environment is demonstrated, above all, by reductions in air, water, and soil
                                 quality, worse acoustic climate, and limited access to green spaces. The most detrimental

                                 in 2012. Therefore, as emphasized by the WHO, air pollution is now the world’s largest
                                 single environmental health risk (Figure <a href="#Fig1">1</a>). Some developed countries, particularly the European Union states and the United

                                 developing countries are generally characterized by weaker environmental regulations

                              <p id="d1e439">The acoustic climate of the environment in Poland is affected, to the largest extent,
                                 by traffic-related noise. The key issue in this category is road noise which, due
                                 to its prevalence, has a vast reach. It varies over time and is emitted by vehicles
                                 moving with irregular frequency and volume. It is created mainly when tires are in
                                 contact with road surfaces and can be exacerbated by the engine characteristics of
                                 a given vehicle [<a href="#R33">33</a>].

                                 the entire area of the European Union [<a href="#R34">34</a>, <a href="#R35">35</a>]. According to the WHO, nearly 40% of the EU’s population (200 million) are exposed
                                 to road noise exceeding 55 dB per day. Around a half of that number are exposed to
                                 noise levels exceeding 65 dB during the day and 150 million—to noise levels over 55
                                 dB at night [<a href="#R36">36</a>]. Since noise is one of the conditions accountable for the situation of the natural
                                 environment and ecological security, Polish cities with a population of over 100 thousand
                                 must have acoustic maps drawn up (Figure <a href="#Fig3">3</a>, Figure <a href="#Fig4">4</a>) [<a href="#R37">37</a>].

                                 Only in Lodz and Wroclaw the level of dissatisfaction is markedly lower. An overwhelming

                                 noise levels is a consequence of road transport universality. Quantitative development
                                 of linear infrastructure in the cities has a knock-on effect in terms of the external
                                 operation of this type of transport which can impact whole urban areas.

                                 hand, they are the persons most responsible for their condition. The analysis of air

                                 transport in the biggest cities [<a href="#R47">47</a>]. Nonetheless, the strategies of development of Warsaw, Cracow, Lodz, Poznan, and
                                 Wroclaw focus on the non-environment-friendly habits of the city dwellers. It is believed

                                 transport, where mass transport is privileged, car traffic in the areas of highest
                                 population concentration is radically limited, and environmental awareness of urban

                                 The studies show that of 79 analyzed European cities, the largest percentage of citizens
                                 unsatisfied with air quality can be found in Cracow. What is more, only 50% of Warsaw
                                 residents are satisfied with air quality, which reflects poorly on the capital city

                                 with the noise level, Polish cities once again fail to be best performers. In the

                                 the desire to live in a cleaner environment and to breathe clean air. To cope with
                                 the major environmental risks inherited from the past, one must employ effective,

                                 of development of Polish metropolises and which will constitute a reasonable compromise
                                 between the interests of various resident groups and diverse developmental needs.

                              <p id="d1e625">The situation serves as a stimulus for citizens to mobilize, often through various
                                 social movements and for local governments to take actions oriented at changing the
                                 methods of domestic heating, more eco-friendly mobility, and enhancing the environmental
                                 education of society. The problem affecting all cities is the growing number of vehicles,
                                 exceeding the capacity of existing road systems.

                              <p id="d1e627">Poland is one of the most motorized European countries. With the factor of 571 cars
                                 per 1000 citizens, it takes a place high above the EU average, which is 505 cars per
                                 1000 citizens. That high value results mainly from the motorization of the inhabitants
                                 of large cities. In Warsaw, it is over 700 cars per 1000 residents, in Krakow, Poznań,
                                 and Wrocław—over 600 cars per 1000 residents. Unfortunately, that value grows each
                                 year, which is a clear evidence of great faults of the urban transport model and civilizational
                                 backwardness. To compare, the number of cars in German cities is constantly dropping.
                                 In 2002, there were 365 cars per 1000 citizens in Berlin, 318 in 2009, and 289 in
                                 2018. In Hamburg, there were 402 cars per 1000 residents in 2009, and 331 in 2018
                                 [<a href="#R51">51</a>]. It is worth remembering that it is residents of urban areas that are responsible
                                 for living conditions. To compare, in the cities with low motorization index and energy
                                 derived from renewable resources residents are satisfied with environmental conditions.
                                 For example, in Hamburg as many as 82% of residents are satisfied with the air quality,
                                 and 72% with the acoustic climate [<a href="#R48">48</a>]. In Groningen, where over 60% of journeys within the city are made by bike [<a href="#R52">52</a>], 92% of the community is satisfied with the air quality and 85% with the acoustic
                                 climate [<a href="#R48">48</a>].

                                 system development, interchange centers (hubs) and the popularization of bicycle and
                                 tram transportation. The adoption of the ‘‘Plan of electro-mobility development’’
                                 by the Polish government in March 2017, the main objective of which is to create conditions

                              <p id="d1e646">The largest Polish cities are facing many challenges for ecological security and,
                                 therefore, the quality of life. Local government authorities should promote pro-environmental
                                 behaviours and support local initiatives; on the other hand, they should also make
                                 decisions conditioning citizens’ behaviours where necessary (such decisions may often
                                 be unfavourable to the community).

                                 has been the establishment of green spaces, including protected areas, forests and
                                 or designated green spaces. Green additions to urban areas increase both city landscape
                                 qualities as well as the quality of life of city dwellers. Nowadays, in Polish cities
                                 we can observe a high degree of space tightening which is a consequence of urbanization
                                 and poses a serious challenge to urban centers. The monitored cities are aware of
                                 the role green spaces play in their structure and regularly implement actions aimed
                                 at revitalizing degraded and post-industrial areas through the planting of trees,
                                 bushes, and creation of flowerbeds (Warsaw). Attractive novel solutions which have
                                 been applied of late take the forms of woonderfs (living streets), pocket parks and
                                 flower-rich grasslands (Lodz, Cracow, Wroclaw).

                                 sustainable development, are supported by administration units of different regions,
                                 local and regional authorities, in consultation with the community which is increasingly
