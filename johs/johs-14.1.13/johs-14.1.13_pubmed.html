                     violent group grievance using quantitative analyses based on original large-N datasets

            <p id="d1e73">Do refugee inflows have an effect on state fragility? In this article I examine whether
               the number
               of refugees, commonly associated in the literature with cultural and economic pressures
               in the
               host country, result in a more fragile state by means of increased violent group grievance.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e75">Refugees are defined in this study as “individuals forced to flee their country due
               to persecution,
               war, or violence with well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion,
               nationality,
               political opinion, or membership of a particular social group” [<a href="#R01">1</a>]. According to the Fragile States
               Index (FSI), violent group grievance is the “violence existing between social groups”
               [<a href="#R02">2</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e83">Violent group grievance captures a distinct form of intrastate violence, specifically
               hate crimes
               and ethnic group clashes associated with powerlessness and discrimination. In particular,
               this
               measure of violence captures “ethnic clashes” such as hate crimes or intrastate conflicts
               attributable to discrimination. My main hypothesis in this paper is that as the number
               of refugees
               increases violent group grievance due to economic and cultural conflict between refugees
               and
               citizens also increases.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e85">I expect the primary participants in this conflict to be the minority refugee group
               and
               citizens (i.e. natives) of the host country. Other actors such as government officials
               (e.g.
               governing elites, their armed forces, and police) or “external” participants (e.g.
               Peace Officers,
               foreign militaries) may also intervene in the conflict to prevent persecution or influence
               the
               outcome. In this paper I focus on the conflict by which citizens violently resist
               refugees due to
               shared perceptions that they may have the most to lose (e.g. job security, cultural
               integrity,
               political influence) to refugees. The foundation of the argument is that refugees
               increase ethnic diversity which in turn may lead to violent group grievance. In contrast,
               refugee absence equates
               to less ethnic diversity and thus less violent group grievances, as defined in this
               article.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e87">By committing violence against the refugees, citizens may believe they protect their
               economic security (e.g. employment opportunities) and assumed dominant national culture
               including traditional and religious practices. In short, citizens may view refugees
               as an economic
               and/or cultural threat. Thus, they may engage in violence over preexisting economic
               resources
               and cultural traditions. The dependent variable provided by the Fragile States Index
               involves
               only measures of violence such as hate crimes or intrastate conflicts attributable
               to ethnic clashes. Further, this study assumes that there is a ‘dominant’ national
               culture and tradition in the host
               state; it does not account for cases where the incoming refugees are of the same culture
               as the
               host state’s culture or that of a major group in the state [<a href="#R03">3</a>]. In this paper, the concept of “culture”
               is defined as linguistic, religious, ethnic, and racial elements which individuals
               often
               subconsciously use to create their sociocultural identities. For example, cultural
               (or even
               subcultural) differences could be as overt as religious practices and appearance (e.g.
               wearing
               yarmulke, burka, etc.) or as subtle as an accent variation of the same language (e.g.
               British vs. American English).
            </p>
            <p id="d1e92">I begin with a literature review on the connection between violent group grievance
               and
               the number of refugees. I then construct a theoretical framework based on economic
               interest
               theory and social identity theory to examine the mechanism of the relationship between
               the
               number of refugees and associated pressures (i.e. cultural differences and competition
               for
               resources) and violent group grievance (i.e. hate crimes and intrastate violence attributable
               to
               ethnic clashes). I proceed to describe the research design, data, and methodology
               to test for these
               effects. Finally, I describe the findings of my analysis and conclude.

            <p id="d1e97">Intrastate violence can manifest in a multitude of ways ranging from small-scale hate
               crimes and homicides to mass-casualty civil war. This literature review focuses solely
               on one
               specific form of unlawful violence: violent group grievance. Unlike the voluminous
               literature on
               civil war, violent group grievance remains largely understudied, which is surprising
               given the
               increase of intrastate violence since the Second World War ([<a href="#R04">4</a>], p. 3). I first discuss existing
               literature on the relationship between violent group grievance and refugees and then
               proceed to
               discuss the theoretical framework of this study that addresses some of the shortcomings
               in the
               violent group grievance literature.

            <div class="section"><a id="s2.1">
                  <!-- named anchor --></a><h3 class="section-title">2.1.- Literature Review</h3>
               <p id="d1e105">In the literature the connection between violent group grievance and refugees is
                  understudied. The existing literature on refugees and violent group grievance is based
                  mainly on
                  qualitative studies. A review of existing literature reveals two main findings: the
                  presence of
                  refugees 1) incites violence [<a href="#R05">5</a>, <a href="#R06">6</a>, <a href="#R07">7</a>] and 2) has a mixed or neutral effect on violence [<a href="#R08">8</a>, <a href="#R09">9</a>, <a href="#R10">10</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e126">Rule [<a href="#R05">5</a>] argues that ethnic violence associated with refugee presence may be attributable
                  to differences amongst social groups. These differences can be political representation,
                  access to
                  resources, or tolerance of contrasting cultural practices such as religion or language.
                  Rule
                  hypothesizes these differences can build to a point of social frustration within a
                  society that may
                  lead to “violent action, not often directed against governments after all, but against
                  members of
                  antagonistic ethnic, racial, or religious groups” (p. 204). Rule does not address
                  the mechanism of
                  the connection between social differences and frustration, but does hypothesize a
                  positive effect
                  of frustration on violence. He argues the “primary source of the human capacity for
                  violence
                  appears to be the frustration-aggression mechanism…If frustrations are sufficiently
                  prolonged or sharply felt, aggression is quite likely [whereby] men who are frustrated
                  have an innate
                  disposition to do violence in proportion to the intensity of their frustration” ([<a href="#R05">5</a>], p. 202). The
                  essence of the theory suggests intergroup frustration amongst refugees and natives
                  has potential
                  to turn violent when individuals perceive “indignation or perceived injustice” ([<a href="#R05">5</a>], p. 202).
               </p>
               <p id="d1e137">To be sure, “frustration” is neither a necessary nor sufficient condition for social
                  conflict.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e139">There are other mediating factors not addressed in Rule’s analytical framework. To
                  illustrate,
                  there are cases where individuals of a population suffer, even starve to death, but
                  still do not
                  engage in violent conflict. An example would be the Islamic Republic of Iran, which
                  is
                  considered amongst the most ethnically diverse and politically corrupt countries annually
                  with
                  over 12 million civilians experiencing starvation (largely attributable to sanctions
                  imposed by the
                  United States) [<a href="#R11">11</a>, <a href="#R12">12</a>]. Members of ten primary ethnic groups in Iran (e.g. Persians, Azerbaijanis,
                  Kurds, Lurs, etc.) experience food poverty and immense repression from their government
                  yet do
                  not engage in violent conflict against their government, one another, or refugees.
                  Thus, other
                  factors may be present under which conflict may or may not manifest from civil frustration.
                  Group grievances are also channeled via non-violent group resistance, such as exclusion
                  of
                  minorities from positions of authority, which in fact is more prevalent than violent
                  group
                  resistance [<a href="#R06">6</a>]. However, non-violent group resistance is beyond the scope of this analysis.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e150">Gurr [<a href="#R13">13</a>] discusses this frustration-aggression mechanism with reference to relative
                  deprivation. Relative deprivation theory states there are perceived capacities (or
                  value
                  expectations) which have potential to create social comparison and in some cases violence
                  ([<a href="#R13">13</a>], p. 22). Specifically, this “destructive behavior [violence] incites as circumstances
                  and quality of life
                  change and groups experience a lack of satisfaction and subsequent frustration” ([<a href="#R13">13</a>], p. 22). In this
                  case, for example, natives may blame refugees as if they perceive diminishing economic
                  wellbeing if resources or job opportunities are limited. Thus, natives may compare
                  their
                  economic resources or perceived economic wellbeing before and after the arrival of
                  refugees,
                  become frustrated, and in some cases violently resist.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e161">According to Zolberg et al. [<a href="#R07">7</a>] rapid, basic transformation of a society’s state and class
                  structures may lead to violence attributable to inequality and oppression of “subordinate
                  classes”
                  including refugees and peasants ([<a href="#R07">7</a>], p. 245). Zolberg et al. [<a href="#R07">7</a>] argue minorities are frequently the
                  victims of small-scale violent conflict because they lack the resource capacity to
                  flee elsewhere
                  ([<a href="#R07">7</a>], p. 256–257). This factor of availability of group resources at the time of societal
                  changes may
                  condition the relationship in ways Rule [<a href="#R05">5</a>] does not take into account. Zolberg et al. did not
                  systematically test the relationship between radical social transformation and violence,
                  but they
                  do make a probabilistic argument that rapid social transformation [10](i.e. effects
                  of globalization) may lead to ethnic violence where neither society nor the state
                  is capable of effectively managing
                  distribution of economic resources, territories, etc. between natives and refugees
                  ([<a href="#R07">7</a>], p. 256–257).

               <p id="d1e182">The latter findings suggest that refugees may have a mixed or neutral effect on violent
                  group grievance as argued by Richmond and Valtonen [<a href="#R10">10</a>]. Richmond and Valtonen argue that
                  “state sovereignty can no longer be maintained in an absolute way… where boundaries
                  are
                  permeable for money, goods, and information but not for people” ([<a href="#R10">10</a>], p. 205). He suggests that
                  economic and developmental factors condition the effect of the number of refugees
                  on conflict,
                  which he examines via a qualitative analysis on “catalysts of social, economic, and
                  political
                  change rooted in migration pressures” ([<a href="#R10">10</a>], p. 26). According to Richmond and Valtonen, the
                  presence of refugees often has a mixed effect on violence depending on whether political
                  institutions provide economic opportunity and integration for refugees in the labor
                  market ([<a href="#R10">10</a>], p. 26). Opportunity in this context refers to refugee capacity to joining the workforce
                  as a driving factor of a growing economy. In contrast, when host countries (such as
                  South Africa in the
                  1950s) do not provide aid in terms of social services (e.g. job placement or welfare
                  for the
                  unemployed) conflict may be more likely ([<a href="#R10">10</a>], p. 25). Thus, for Richmond and Valtonen an
                  important factor that may affect the level of violent group conflict is the state
                  policies aimed at
                  incorporating refugees in the economy and labor market; in other words the driving
                  factor in
                  conflict avoidance is the host country’s capacity of providing economic opportunity.

               <p id="d1e201">Koopmans [<a href="#R11">11</a>] takes into account political factors that may explain violent group
                  grievance. He examines European cases from 1988 to 1993 to assess the apparent effect
                  of the
                  number of refugees on internal violence and voting for radical parties of the right.
                  Koopmans
                  explores whether or not the presence of refugees has an effect on violent ethnic conflict
                  and right
                  wing voting intended to prevent further influxes of minorities. He presents a theoretical
                  argument
                  on grievance and opportunity to explain the assumed connection between radical party
                  voting
                  and violence attributable to racism. To clarify, he theorizes natives attribute their
                  hardships to
                  refugees and thus violently express grievances against refugee groups when elected
                  political
                  elites “enable” (actual or perceived) social justifications for doing so. The findings
                  show
                  Germany experienced the highest level of internal violence involving refugees and
                  minority groups due to a “combination of nationalist rhetoric by established parties
                  and swift and effective
                  policies restricting the rights of foreigners and refugees” ([<a href="#R11">11</a>], p. 211).
               </p>
               <p id="d1e209">A weakness of Koopmans’ study is the lack of specification and operationalization
                  of the
                  violence measure. The author simply refers to this measure as capturing “extreme right
                  and racist
                  violent actions” ([<a href="#R11">11</a>], p. 204). In this quantitative study, different countries have conflicting
                  definitions and interpretations of what racist violence may be. For example, the “racial
                  violence”
                  measure for Great Britain could include “threatening behavior or physical attacks”
                  reported by
                  refugees/native British, whereas the violence measure for Germany required Volksverhetzung
                  (incitement to racial hatred) influencing an act of violence reported to and involving
                  police
                  authority ([<a href="#R11">11</a>], p. 189). Consistent anti-Semitic hate crimes and small-scale acts of violence are
                  an
                  example of cases frequently included in Koopmans’ analysis. Further, Koopmans concludes
                  that
                  results are mixed due to other intervening factors such as police presence and aspects
                  of political
                  party and level of democracy. This study presents an argument for political parties
                  conditioning
                  the effect of the number of refugees on violent group grievance that is consistent
                  with the
                  expectation described above that in democracies the level of violence may be higher
                  than that in
                  autocratic regimes. The underlying theory is that democracies permit grievances to
                  be aired in
                  the form of public demonstrations that have potential to turn violent, whereas autocracies
                  often
                  repress such demonstrations from occurring.

               <p id="d1e218">More recently, Krcmaric [<a href="#R08">8</a>] examines social structural factors by considering why refugee
                  flows may cause conflict in some host states but not others. He argues “refugees cause
                  conflict
                  when they alter the host state’s ethnic balance of power [in their favor]” ([<a href="#R08">8</a>], p. 182). This ethnic
                  balance of power refers to the host state’s “ethnic contract… a bargain that specifies
                  how groups
                  divide benefits in accordance with the underlying distribution of power” ([<a href="#R08">8</a>], p. 183). He
                  concludes shifts in relative power may result in shifts of this ethnic contract for
                  social, political,
                  or resource benefits and thus subsequently incite violence over these changes. In
                  short, refugees
                  obtaining political or social power (by means of elections or otherwise) may experience
                  an
                  increase in benefits that citizens may perceive as unjust and use violence to maintain
                  their
                  perceived claim to existing benefits.

               <p id="d1e229">Krcmaric [<a href="#R08">8</a>] applies theories of bargaining failure and war to the number of refugees and
                  ethnic violence. Essentially the capacity to negotiate and compromise on territories,
                  laws, and
                  cultural practices conditions the effect of the relationship between refugee flows
                  and violence.
                  He examines the case of Serbia’s Kosovo region in 1999 when “animosity” between ethnic
                  Albanians and native Serbians escalated rapidly as oppressive policies of Serbian
                  president
                  Slobodan Milosevic fueled growth of resistance groups ([<a href="#R08">8</a>], p. 195). After Milosevic launched an
                  ethnic-cleansing operation against Albanian villages in Serbia hundreds of thousands
                  of citizens
                  fled south towards Albania and Macedonia. Both of these countries had remarkable social,
                  geographic, economic, and political similarities with the notable exception of ethnic
                  composition
                  and sociopolitical tolerance ([<a href="#R08">8</a>], pp. 206, 214). Demographically, Macedonia consisted of a Slav
                  majority with an Albanian minority and Albania was a homogeneously Albanian population.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e240">As the crisis intensified and over 300,000 Kosovar Albanian refugees crossed into
                  Macedonia, “ethnic animosity increased and police and border guards allegedly abused
                  refugees”
                  inciting refugee retaliation and persistent small-scale conflicts thereafter ([<a href="#R08">8</a>], p. 206). Refugees
                  responded by first organizing a group known as the National Liberation Army (NLA)
                  and then
                  setting demands for the use of Albanian as “the official state language, a new census,
                  an
                  Albanian university, and greater influence in national politics” due to the radical
                  demographic
                  shift ([<a href="#R07">7</a>], p. 208). Krcmaric argues the sudden influx of Kosovar Albanians in Macedonia “upset
                  the distribution of latent power and distribution of benefits between the Slav majority
                  and
                  Albanian minority” ([<a href="#R08">8</a>], pp. 196, 207) which incited violent group grievance across the region [<a href="#R14">14</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e254">Meanwhile, Albania, incurring over 400,000 Kosovar Albanian refugees, provided
                  refugees with resources (even homes) to facilitate the mass migration ([<a href="#R08">8</a>], p. 212). In doing so,
                  refugees were reportedly “grateful” and began looking for work in the region to establish
                  cross national relationships and solutions for economic and social prosperity. His
                  findings suggest
                  Macedonia experienced conflict because civilians perceived refugee flows to “upset
                  the level of
                  power between the country’s ethnic groups” ([<a href="#R08">8</a>], p. 214). Krcmaric argues this stark contrast in
                  violent or non-violent outcome is attributable to the ethnic balance of power; In
                  essence, there
                  was no native group to act on a perceived threat, whereas the Slav majority in Macedonia
                  feared
                  becoming the demographic minority and violently repressed to maintain economic and
                  political
                  power and the benefits of such power (e.g. territory or job opportunity).

               <p id="d1e262">In sum, existing literature on the connection between refugees and violent group grievance
                  examines a number of socio-structural, psychological, and political factors that may
                  help explain
                  cases where the number of refugees result in varying degrees of violence. However,
                  there is a
                  lack of data and systematic analyses to evaluate different propositions. In this article
                  I examine
                  this question systematically; I construct a more developed theoretical framework incorporating
                  both economic and cultural-based theories to articulate why I expect the number of
                  refugees to
                  result in increased violent group grievance. Then I conduct an analysis that controls
                  for
                  intervening factors.

               <p id="d1e267">In this section, I argue that the connection between the number of refugees and violent
                  group grievance can partly be explained by <i>differences</i> in culture (e.g. language or religion)
                  and/or competition for resources. Violence can indeed occur between members of the
                  same
                  ethnic group. However, this does not align with my theoretical framework to suggest
                  violence
                  results from language or religious tensions amongst members of the <i>same</i> ethnic group (e.g.
                  Syrians in Germany) since the out-group (i.e. refugees) collectively share an identity
                  which may
                  violently clash with the in-group (i.e. native citizens) due to cultural differences
                  and/or competition for resources. Thus, controlling for the same/different ethnicity
                  would provide a
                  more vigorous test of my claim. This would perhaps even allow the possibility to distinguish
                  between racial and ethnic effects also. Due to data limitations, however, my argument
                  that
                  violent group grievance can partly be explained by differences in culture remains
                  an assumption
                  since data does not reveal if refugee groups of a given country, year are of a certain
                  ethnicity.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e275">I propose the mechanism of social identity and economic interest theory affects violent
                  group grievance occurring within a state. Differences between social ethnic groups
                  may become
                  increasingly significant when one group attempts to violently suppress the other in
                  an effort to
                  protect resources, way of life, or out of xenophobic tension [<a href="#R15">15</a>]. Thus, the number of refugees
                  may increase the level of violent group grievance occurring within a state as differences
                  amongst
                  the in and out-groups become recognized and stimulate prejudices capable of turning
                  violent.

               <p id="d1e280">Citizens perceiving economic and cultural threats associated with refugees are more
                  likely to manifest violent group grievance to avoid the damaging effects of this perceived
                  threat
                  than those who do not, unless the political regime is capable and willing of effective
                  repression

               <p id="d1e282">Sniderman et al. [<a href="#R16">16</a>] examine the basis of this civil opposition to immigrant minorities.
                  Their analysis relies on public opinion survey data collected in The Netherlands from
                  1997–1998.
                  Findings suggest that considerations for national identity “dominate those of economic
                  advantage which evoke exclusionary policies” and anti-immigrant sentiments at large
                  ([<a href="#R16">16</a>], p. 35).
                  I examine how economic and cultural factors may result in violence- not just anti-immigrant
                  sentiments. Scholars such as Rule [<a href="#R05">5</a>] incorporate aspects of religion or language into their
                  definition of culture. My definition of culture includes consideration for racial
                  (i.e. xenophobic)
                  tension as well.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e293">By incorporating the possibility for cultural (i.e. racial or ethnic) factors to play
                  a role in
                  addition to economic and political conditions, we might be able to better understand
                  why states
                  exhibit violence without resource scarcity. Lake and Rothchild [<a href="#R17">17</a>] argued, “ethnic violence is
                  most often caused by collective fears of the future” ([<a href="#R17">17</a>], p. 41). They provide a theoretical link
                  between “collective fears” and ethnic conflict. They argue most ethnic groups coexist
                  quite
                  harmoniously until “ethnicity is linked with acute social uncertainty, a history of
                  conflict, and
                  fear of what the future might bring” ([<a href="#R17">17</a>], p. 43). As these fears arise “states lose their ability to
                  arbitrate between groups or provide credible guarantees of protection for groups which
                  as central
                  authority declines, become fearful for their survival” ([<a href="#R17">17</a>], p. 43). This conflict could then begin
                  to manifest as the masses begin to fear for the safety and struggle to resolve perceived
                  dilemmas
                  surrounding culture or resources. It is a distinctly separate condition from a purely
                  economic-driven
                  assumption to explain why conflict may occur.

               <p id="d1e307">In sum, the number of refugees may result in violent group grievance due to social,
                  political, and economic conditions. I argue that cultural in addition to economic
                  theories may
                  help us understand the relationship between the number of refugees and violent group
                  grievance.
                  Specifically, I rely on the social identity and economic interest theory to examine
                  the relationship
                  between refugee presence and violent group grievance. I argue that when aspects of
                  group
                  identities such as ethnicity, language, or religion are impacted by an increase in
                  immigration, the
                  primary ethnic group may resist the perceived threat(s) posed by refugees. This resistance
                  may
                  take the form of violent means to 1) prevent their national identity and way of life
                  from being
                  compromised and 2) protect access to scarce economic resources.

               <p id="d1e309">The social identity theory postulates that perceived threat from conflicting religious
                  values, and opportunity for misunderstandings based on language or cultural differences
                  can incite protest participation, panic, even violence ([<a href="#R16">16</a>], pp. 35–36). The premise of this theory is that
                  individuals of a society exist, interact, and compete across a variety of social groups
                  for relative
                  power, resources, and benefits [<a href="#R18">18</a>, <a href="#R19">19</a>]. In this case, natives of a host country function as the in-group,
                  while refugees may be treated as the out-group and as a result are targeted for a
                  perceived
                  threat to in-group way of life and resources.

               <p id="d1e320">The social identity theory is an emotion-based approach to understanding violent group

                  “mechanism that triggers action to satisfying a pressing concern” [<a href="#R20">20</a>], p. 17). He argues an
                  emotion like fear or hatred “raises the saliency of one concern over another and heightens
                  cognitive and physical capabilities necessary to respond to the situational challenge”
                  [<a href="#R20">20</a>], p. 17–18). Thus, a native in-group perceiving a threat to aspects of their culture
                  may act on their
                  negative emotions to preserve their cultural identity and way of life. According to
                  Petersen [<a href="#R20">20</a>]
                  violent group grievance may occur when 1) a structural change (such as a refugee influx)
                  occurs,
                  2) the native in-group perceives a threat, and 3) collectively builds emotions such
                  as fear, hatred,
                  or resentment-based, then 4) act on emotions to resist perceived threats to wellbeing
                  (i.e. cultural
                  integrity or access to resources) ([<a href="#R20">20</a>], p. 23). To be clear, he does not propose a mechanism that
                  turns resentment among the native population into violence. I, however, argue this
                  mechanism is
                  the perceived threat to culture and/or resources.

               <p id="d1e337">O’Rourke and Sinnott [<a href="#R21">21</a>] argue non-economic, cultural factors may even be the main
                  drivers of anti-immigrant and refugee sentiments. They suggest natives derive utility
                  from
                  “living in a society with a well-defined sense of national identity and well-understood
                  and
                  accepted social norms… natives may oppose excessive immigration on the grounds that
                  it
                  undermines these norms with or without disliking foreigners per se” [<a href="#R21">21</a>], p. 844). To test these
                  assumptions O’Rourke and Sinnott [<a href="#R21">21</a>] use the 1995 International Social Survey Programme
                  (ISSP) module on national identity. Citizens from 24 countries were polled from 1995-1996
                  to
                  determine the level of anti-immigrant and refugee sentiments. Findings suggest respondents
                  demonstrated “attitudes towards immigration reflecting nationalist sentiment”, especially
                  when
                  natives perceive refugees to have limited skills and subsequent contribution to their
                  economy ([<a href="#R21">21</a>],
                  p. 857).

               <p id="d1e351">Further, the economic interest theory posits actual or perceived competition for scarce
                  resources translates into inter-group conflict [<a href="#R22">22</a>, <a href="#R23">23</a>]. Rule [<a href="#R05">5</a>], Zolberg et al. [<a href="#R07">7</a>], and Krcmaric
                  [<a href="#R08">8</a>] refer to this potential for competition for economic resources to incite conflict
                  between social
                  groups but do not take into account social factors. Specifically, the social identity
                  argument may
                  help to explain some of the case anomalies where competition for resources falls short
                  as an
                  explanation for violent conflict [<a href="#R24">24</a>, <a href="#R25">25</a>, <a href="#R26">26</a>].

               <p id="d1e379">My underlying theoretical assumption then is that citizens of the host country resort
                  to
                  violence in an attempt to protect 1) existing economic/resource benefits and 2) their
                  cultural
                  practices and way of life [<a href="#R27">27</a>]. However, developmental, political, and institutional factors are
                  expected to mitigate the effects of these inflows on conflict. For example, economically
                  developed states have policies such as labor laws and safety nets that serve as an
                  economic
                  buffer to “external” influences (such as the number of refugees) which developing
                  countries
                  often lack ([<a href="#R28">28</a>], pp. 29–31, [<a href="#R29">29</a>], p. 84). Further, democratic regimes may experience more conflict
                  because of constitutional protections for freedom of association such as protests,
                  demonstrations,
                  and institutions that may mobilize supporters based on such identities of culture
                  (e.g. ethnicity or
                  religion). Then again, democracies are based on greater tolerance of diversity that
                  may result in
                  less violence. My model controls for level of democracy that allows for testing of
                  these
                  alternative effects.

                  Index
                  (FSI) states that group grievance is the “tension and violence existing between social
                  groups and
                  the state’s ability to provide security is undermined allowing the potential for further
                  fear and
                  violence” [<a href="#R30">30</a>]. The Fund for Peace provides this variable by using quantitative and qualitative
                  analyses to derive a 1 (low levels of violent grievance) -10 (severe violent grievance)
                  value for
                  178 states annually starting in 2015. Low levels of violent group grievance suggest
                  rare and
                  relatively less-severe occurrences of ethnic violence (e.g. single hate crime resulting
                  in a single
                  death), where as high level of violent grievance suggest frequent and severe (i.e.
                  high morbidity
                  and mortality) acts of ethnic violence (e.g. mass shootings, persecution, violent

                  discrimination, powerlessness, and intrastate violence. More specifically, this measure
                  of
                  violence captures “ethnic clashes” such as hate crimes or intrastate conflicts attributable
                  to
                  discrimination [<a href="#R30">30</a>]. For example, these violent events must involve <i>ethnic</i> clashes rather than interpersonal (e.g. relationships) or criminal (e.g. robbery).

               <p id="d1e411">“Ethnic” in this context is used to distinguish between the dominant national culture
                  and
                  that of incoming refugees [<a href="#R03">3</a>]. The main independent variable does not distinguish among ethnic
                  groups. As such, cases that do not have a dominant culture are included in my analysis;
                  this may
                  be considered a limitation to this study. The data do not distinguish among native
                  and refugee
                  ethnic groups. The assumption is that the dominant native culture and the refugee

                  country due to persecution, war, or violence with well-founded fear of persecution
                  for reasons of

                  group” [<a href="#R01">1</a>]. The
                  World Bank provides number of refugees by estimating the refugee population by
                  country/territory of asylum for 264 states annually from 1960-2014. I use <i>number of refugees</i> in
                  the model (not the percent of refugees as a percent of the population) due to the
                  widespread
                  “visibility” of their presence irrespective of the size of the host state’s population,

               <p id="d1e432">Based on the previously discussed theoretical mechanism, I expect pressures associated
                  with the number of refugees to increase violent conflict. The underlying mechanism
                  is citizens
                  may perceive refugees as a threat to resources or culture, rather than contributing
                  members to a
                  growing workforce, and engage in violence to preserve their way of life and access
                  to scarce
                  resources. Civil frustration and ethnic tension may result in hate crimes (i.e. group
                  grievance)
                  against refugees and small-scale social conflict capable of contributing to a state’s
                  fragility by
                  means of unlawful violence. A state quickly ending violence could be observed as less
                  fragile,
                  but the assumption is that strong states with governing authority are able to mitigate,
                  prevent, or
                  deter the majority of these cases.

               <p id="d1e441">GDP per capita is the gross domestic product divided by midyear population in U.S.

                  suggesting
                  that an increase in GDP/capita will result in fewer grievances. The assumption is
                  that
                  socioeconomic wellbeing for citizens results in more resources and thus less competition
                  for
                  such resources and so decreasing the potential for violent grievances.

                  and struggle to secure a living, they may be more vulnerable economically and thus
                  more likely
                  to compete for already limited resources for survival. In LDCs refugees consuming
                  scarce
                  resources may be more likely to trigger violence by citizens against perceived contributors
                  to
                  economic hardship. In developed states where resources are relatively less scarce
                  and thus
                  competition for resources lower, lower levels of violent group grievance are expected.
                  Further, I
                  assume that increases in human development address certain grievances (such as economic
                  hardship), whereas lower levels of human development may be associated with competition

               <p id="d1e457">I utilize two indicators to capture democracy. First, the Polity IV Project provides
                  data on
                  the level of democracy for 167 countries from 1946-2015. The values range from Autocracy
                  (-10) to Full Democracy (10). Second, the World Bank created a “Voice and Accountability”
                  variable to capture perceptions of the “extent to which citizens are able to participate
                  in selecting

                  [<a href="#R31">31</a>]. This
                  variable has a range from -2.5 to 2.5 for a given country, year. Lower values signify
                  weaker
                  democracy, while higher values signify stronger democracy in relation to the variable
                  description
                  above. The two indicators are correlated at 0.8395, but there is no multicollinearity

                  of statistical significance.

               <p id="d1e462">Democracies often permit citizens (through constitutions or political doctrine) to
                  participate in public protests and demonstrations, which have the potential to turn

                  grievances are aired. Protest demonstrations and alternative institutional arrangements
                  (e.g. political parties and organizations) may be largely suppressed in autocracies,
                  thus less violent
                  group grievance would be expected. However, democratic institutions are channels for
                  the

                  in democracies
                  than in autocratic regimes. Thus, democracy may be associated positively of negatively
                  with
                  violent group conflict.

                  than in
                  autocratic regimes. For example, citizens in a democracy may use the vote to act on
                  their
                  underlying grievances whereas citizens in autocracies or authoritarian political systems
                  are not
                  able to participate in elections and therefore may take it upon themselves to act
                  on their
                  grievances against perceived threats. Therefore, although I expect higher levels of
                  violent group
                  grievance in democracies than autocracies, the effect may be in the opposite direction.

                  Corruption also has a range from -2.5 to 2.5 for a given country, year. Similarly,
                  lower values
                  signify weaker control of corruption, while higher values signify stronger control
                  of corruption in
                  relation to the variable description.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e471">I expect the relationship between control of corruption and group grievance to be
                  negative, suggesting that a government’s inability to control corruption results in
                  an increase in
                  violent group grievance. This may be due to the allocation of resources to address
                  pressures
                  resulting from the number of refugees. States that have greater control of corruption
                  may allocate
                  such resources more effectively (addressing refugees’ needs and citizens’ grievances)
                  thus
                  containing the level of violence compared to states that have less control of corruption.

               <p id="d1e473">5. Political Stability</p>
               <p id="d1e475">The World Bank operationalizes Political Stability as the perceptions of the likelihood
                  of
                  politically motivated violence, including acts of terrorism. This measure of politically
                  motivated
                  violence includes acts of state-sponsored and non-state group acts of terrorism. Non-state
                  group
                  acts of terrorism are included only if the attack was committed to advance a political
                  cause. By
                  this definition, I expect the relationship between political stability and violent
                  group grievance to
                  be negative, suggesting that a government capable of inflicting or permitting politically-motivated
                  violence on its citizens to also be capable of repressing citizens from committing
                  acts
                  of violent group grievance.
                  
               </p>
               <p id="d1e477">This Worldwide Governance Indicator also has a range from -2.5 to 2.5 for a given
                  country, year. Lower values signify weaker stability, while higher values signify
                  stronger
                  stability in relation to the variable description above.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e479">6. Population Size</p>
               <p id="d1e481">The World Bank contains a variable indicator of population size for country-year,
                  defined
                  operationally as the number of residents of the state regardless of legal status/citizenship
                  [<a href="#R31">31</a>]. I
                  anticipate a positive relationship between population size and grievance, suggesting
                  that in states
                  with larger populations the opportunity for violence may be larger than in countries
                  with smaller
                  populations. On the other hand, larger states are better equipped to deal with refugees
                  and might
                  also be more diverse, thus lessening the cultural threat perception.

            <p id="d1e531">Table <a href="#Tab1">1</a> shows the effect of the number of refugees on violent group grievance is statistically
               significant and in the anticipated direction.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e536">The regression results indicate that as refugee pressures increase, group grievance
               also
               increases by 5.00e-07 on average [<a href="#R33">33</a>]. To illustrate, an increase in refugees from 100,000 to
               200,000 results in an increase of .05 in the index of violent group grievance (a scale
               from 1 to
               10). This finding confirms the main hypothesis of this study on the effect of refugee
               pressures on
               violent group grievance.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e541">The effect on the dependent variable is shown in Figure <a href="#Fig1">1</a>, which shows the statistically
               significant, positive relationship between number of refugees and violent group grievance.
               Predicted values of violent group grievance as numbers of refugees increase from zero
               to three
               million are shown on the Y-axis of Figure 1.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e546">As this figure indicates, high numbers of refugees are not always “necessary” for
               a state
               to experience mid-to-high degrees of violent grievance capable of impacting fragility
               [<a href="#R34">34</a>]. This
               finding suggests that number of refugees is an important determinant of state fragility.
               As such,
               the inclusion of refugees belongs in the security studies literature.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e551">All control variables are statistically significant. However, four coefficients are
               not in the
               direction expected. First, the relationship between GDP/capita and violent group grievance
               is
               positive; suggesting increased GDP/capita results in more violent group grievance.
               This finding
               appears to be reinforcing the argument made by Sniderman et al. [<a href="#R16">16</a>] that cultural factors may
               account for violent conflict even in circumstances where there is relative economic
               prosperity.
               However, the unanticipated negative effect needs to be investigated further. To be
               sure, GDP/per capita is not an indicator of wealth distribution, or level of economic
               inequality that
               may be a better predictor of violent group grievance.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e556">Second, the relationship between HDI and violent group grievance is also positive.
               While contrary to initial expectation, the finding mirrors that of GDP/capita therefore
               not
               surprising. This finding suggests that an increase in development in terms of education,
               longevity,
               and income also results in increased violent group grievance. This may be attributable
               to
               civilians violently resisting perceived threats from the number of refugees to protect
               current
               benefits associated with development.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e558">Third, the relationship between voice and accountability and violent group grievance
               is
               positive, suggesting that an increase of <i>freedom of expression, association</i>, and <i>free media</i> is
               associated with an increase in violent grievance. This may suggest the freedom to
               express
               grievances has potential to turn violent (e.g. protests resulting into riots).
            </p>
            <p id="d1e566">Lastly, the relationship between level of democracy and violent group grievance is
               positive, suggesting that increased democracy results in more violent group grievance.
               The
               rationale may reside in autocratic elites being able to effectively oppress citizen
               opposition and
               violence before violent group grievances increase. In contrast, democratic states
               permitting
               expression of grievances (e.g. protests) may indirectly permit increased opportunity
               for violence
               to erupt.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e568">Because of the unexpected directions of these coefficients, I test for multicollinearity
               to
               determine potentially highly collinear measures amongst the Worldwide Governance Indicators.
               Voice and accountability, control of corruption, and political stability were highly
               correlated, but
               further testing revealed that controlling for this collinearity did not affect the
               statistical
               significance or direction of any variables.

            <p id="d1e793">This research examines the relationship between the number of refugees and violent
               group grievance. The main hypothesis in this study was confirmed while controlling
               for a variety
               of factors associated with violent group grievance as an indicator of state fragility’s
               dimension of
               authority. This first large-N quantitative analysis is consistent with findings in
               the literature that
               number of refugees result in increased violent group grievance. I argue the theoretical
               mechanism for this relationship to be social competition for resources and preservation
               of
               cultural identity.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e795">In conclusion, states experiencing economic or cultural pressures associated with
               refugees may experience increased violent group grievance and thus increased fragility.
               My
               findings imply that richer, democratic states are more fragile in this context than
               less developed,
               autocratic states. This contradicts assumptions in the literature on fragile states
               suggesting rich
               democracies are often less fragile than poor developing countries [<a href="#R36">36</a>]. Improving data and exploring
               other potential determinants of violent group grievance may help researchers to better
               understand
               the mechanism and dynamics of this association.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e800">Now, a limitation of this study is that <i>violent group grievance</i> does not distinguish
               empirically between violence against refugees and that against immigrants. Rather,
               the measure
               captures ethnic violence, specifically hate crimes and conflicts attributable to discrimination.
               Such violence, to be sure, may include acts of violence committed against immigrants;
               however,
               it is not possible to deconstruct this index since each value of this variable is
               based on
               quantitative and qualitative data I do not have access to. To account in part for
               this limitation I
               attempted to locate data on the number of immigrants to include it in the analysis
               as a control
               variable. However, such data were not available for the cases and years included in
               my study.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e805">Another limitation of this study is that I assume that each country in the data sample
               has a
               “dominant” culture that is different from that of the refugees. Refugees that have
               the same
               culture as that of the dominant group or a group in the host state may experience
               less violent
               group grievance; but I do not test for this effect.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e807">Lastly, I incorporate a variety of economic (e.g. GDP/capita), social (e.g. human
               development, democracy), political (e.g. corruption, stability) and demographic (e.g.
               population
               size) variables to examine the relationship between the number of refugees and violent
               group
               grievance. However, I am unable to test certain cultural factors (e.g. language differences)
               across
               all countries due to data and empirical limitations. For example, I do not examine
               every refugee
               group’s relationship with all other countries (e.g. Syrian refugees in every host
               country outside of
               Syria with consideration for language differences), which deviates heavily from an
               exploratory
               study on violent group grievance to less-related aspects outside this study’s analytical
               scope.
               This large-N quantitative analysis is meant to provide an overall interpretation of
               the number of
               refugees and violent group grievance with available data.
