         <title>1.- Introduction</title>
         <p>Do refugee inflows have an effect on state fragility? In this article I examine whether the number
of refugees, commonly associated in the literature with cultural and economic pressures in the
host country, result in a more fragile state by means of increased violent group grievance.</p>
         <p>Refugees are defined in this study as “individuals forced to flee their country due to persecution,
war, or violence with well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality,
political opinion, or membership of a particular social group” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R01">1</xref>]. According to the Fragile States
Index (FSI), violent group grievance is the “violence existing between social groups” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R02">2</xref>].</p>
         <p>Violent group grievance captures a distinct form of intrastate violence, specifically hate crimes
and ethnic group clashes associated with powerlessness and discrimination. In particular, this
measure of violence captures “ethnic clashes” such as hate crimes or intrastate conflicts
attributable to discrimination. My main hypothesis in this paper is that as the number of refugees
increases violent group grievance due to economic and cultural conflict between refugees and
citizens also increases.</p>
         <p>I expect the primary participants in this conflict to be the minority refugee group and
citizens (i.e. natives) of the host country. Other actors such as government officials (e.g.
governing elites, their armed forces, and police) or “external” participants (e.g. Peace Officers,
foreign militaries) may also intervene in the conflict to prevent persecution or influence the
outcome. In this paper I focus on the conflict by which citizens violently resist refugees due to
shared perceptions that they may have the most to lose (e.g. job security, cultural integrity,
political influence) to refugees. The foundation of the argument is that refugees increase ethnic diversity which in turn may lead to violent group grievance. In contrast, refugee absence equates
to less ethnic diversity and thus less violent group grievances, as defined in this article.</p>
         <p>By committing violence against the refugees, citizens may believe they protect their
economic security (e.g. employment opportunities) and assumed dominant national culture
including traditional and religious practices. In short, citizens may view refugees as an economic
and/or cultural threat. Thus, they may engage in violence over preexisting economic resources
and cultural traditions. The dependent variable provided by the Fragile States Index involves
only measures of violence such as hate crimes or intrastate conflicts attributable to ethnic clashes. Further, this study assumes that there is a ‘dominant’ national culture and tradition in the host
state; it does not account for cases where the incoming refugees are of the same culture as the
host state’s culture or that of a major group in the state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R03">3</xref>]. In this paper, the concept of “culture”
is defined as linguistic, religious, ethnic, and racial elements which individuals often
subconsciously use to create their sociocultural identities. For example, cultural (or even
subcultural) differences could be as overt as religious practices and appearance (e.g. wearing
yarmulke, burka, etc.) or as subtle as an accent variation of the same language (e.g. British vs. American English).</p>
         <p>I begin with a literature review on the connection between violent group grievance and
the number of refugees. I then construct a theoretical framework based on economic interest
theory and social identity theory to examine the mechanism of the relationship between the
number of refugees and associated pressures (i.e. cultural differences and competition for
resources) and violent group grievance (i.e. hate crimes and intrastate violence attributable to
ethnic clashes). I proceed to describe the research design, data, and methodology to test for these
effects. Finally, I describe the findings of my analysis and conclude.</p>

         <title>2.- Literature Review and Theoretical Framework</title>
         <p>Intrastate violence can manifest in a multitude of ways ranging from small-scale hate
crimes and homicides to mass-casualty civil war. This literature review focuses solely on one
specific form of unlawful violence: violent group grievance. Unlike the voluminous literature on
civil war, violent group grievance remains largely understudied, which is surprising given the
increase of intrastate violence since the Second World War ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R04">4</xref>], p. 3). I first discuss existing
literature on the relationship between violent group grievance and refugees and then proceed to
discuss the theoretical framework of this study that addresses some of the shortcomings in the
violent group grievance literature.</p>
         <sec id="s2.1">
            <title>2.1.- Literature Review</title>
            <p>In the literature the connection between violent group grievance and refugees is
understudied. The existing literature on refugees and violent group grievance is based mainly on
qualitative studies. A review of existing literature reveals two main findings: the presence of
refugees 1) incites violence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R05">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R06">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R07">7</xref>] and 2) has a mixed or neutral effect on violence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R08">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R09">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>].</p>
            <p>Rule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R05">5</xref>] argues that ethnic violence associated with refugee presence may be attributable
to differences amongst social groups. These differences can be political representation, access to
resources, or tolerance of contrasting cultural practices such as religion or language. Rule
hypothesizes these differences can build to a point of social frustration within a society that may
lead to “violent action, not often directed against governments after all, but against members of
antagonistic ethnic, racial, or religious groups” (p. 204). Rule does not address the mechanism of
the connection between social differences and frustration, but does hypothesize a positive effect
of frustration on violence. He argues the “primary source of the human capacity for violence
appears to be the frustration-aggression mechanism…If frustrations are sufficiently prolonged or sharply felt, aggression is quite likely [whereby] men who are frustrated have an innate
disposition to do violence in proportion to the intensity of their frustration” ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R05">5</xref>], p. 202). The
essence of the theory suggests intergroup frustration amongst refugees and natives has potential
to turn violent when individuals perceive “indignation or perceived injustice” ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R05">5</xref>], p. 202).</p>
            <p>To be sure, “frustration” is neither a necessary nor sufficient condition for social conflict.</p>
            <p>There are other mediating factors not addressed in Rule’s analytical framework. To illustrate,
there are cases where individuals of a population suffer, even starve to death, but still do not
engage in violent conflict. An example would be the Islamic Republic of Iran, which is
considered amongst the most ethnically diverse and politically corrupt countries annually with
over 12 million civilians experiencing starvation (largely attributable to sanctions imposed by the
United States) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. Members of ten primary ethnic groups in Iran (e.g. Persians, Azerbaijanis,
Kurds, Lurs, etc.) experience food poverty and immense repression from their government yet do
not engage in violent conflict against their government, one another, or refugees. Thus, other
factors may be present under which conflict may or may not manifest from civil frustration.
Group grievances are also channeled via non-violent group resistance, such as exclusion of
minorities from positions of authority, which in fact is more prevalent than violent group
resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R06">6</xref>]. However, non-violent group resistance is beyond the scope of this analysis.</p>
            <p>Gurr [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>] discusses this frustration-aggression mechanism with reference to relative
deprivation. Relative deprivation theory states there are perceived capacities (or value
expectations) which have potential to create social comparison and in some cases violence ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>], p. 22). Specifically, this “destructive behavior [violence] incites as circumstances and quality of life
change and groups experience a lack of satisfaction and subsequent frustration” ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>], p. 22). In this
case, for example, natives may blame refugees as if they perceive diminishing economic wellbeing if resources or job opportunities are limited. Thus, natives may compare their
economic resources or perceived economic wellbeing before and after the arrival of refugees,
become frustrated, and in some cases violently resist.</p>
            <p>According to Zolberg et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R07">7</xref>] rapid, basic transformation of a society’s state and class
structures may lead to violence attributable to inequality and oppression of “subordinate classes”
including refugees and peasants ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R07">7</xref>], p. 245). Zolberg et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R07">7</xref>] argue minorities are frequently the
victims of small-scale violent conflict because they lack the resource capacity to flee elsewhere
([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R07">7</xref>], p. 256–257). This factor of availability of group resources at the time of societal changes may
condition the relationship in ways Rule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R05">5</xref>] does not take into account. Zolberg et al. did not
systematically test the relationship between radical social transformation and violence, but they
do make a probabilistic argument that rapid social transformation [10](i.e. effects of globalization) may lead to ethnic violence where neither society nor the state is capable of effectively managing
distribution of economic resources, territories, etc. between natives and refugees ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R07">7</xref>], p. 256–257).</p>
            <p>The latter findings suggest that refugees may have a mixed or neutral effect on violent
group grievance as argued by Richmond and Valtonen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>]. Richmond and Valtonen argue that
“state sovereignty can no longer be maintained in an absolute way… where boundaries are
permeable for money, goods, and information but not for people” ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>], p. 205). He suggests that
economic and developmental factors condition the effect of the number of refugees on conflict,
which he examines via a qualitative analysis on “catalysts of social, economic, and political
change rooted in migration pressures” ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>], p. 26). According to Richmond and Valtonen, the
presence of refugees often has a mixed effect on violence depending on whether political institutions provide economic opportunity and integration for refugees in the labor market ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>], p. 26). Opportunity in this context refers to refugee capacity to joining the workforce as a driving factor of a growing economy. In contrast, when host countries (such as South Africa in the
1950s) do not provide aid in terms of social services (e.g. job placement or welfare for the
unemployed) conflict may be more likely ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>], p. 25). Thus, for Richmond and Valtonen an
important factor that may affect the level of violent group conflict is the state policies aimed at
incorporating refugees in the economy and labor market; in other words the driving factor in
conflict avoidance is the host country’s capacity of providing economic opportunity.</p>
            <p>To my knowledge, there are no systematic studies that examine directly the relationship
between institutional arrangements for economic integration and violence.</p>
            <p>Koopmans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>] takes into account political factors that may explain violent group
grievance. He examines European cases from 1988 to 1993 to assess the apparent effect of the
number of refugees on internal violence and voting for radical parties of the right. Koopmans
explores whether or not the presence of refugees has an effect on violent ethnic conflict and right
wing voting intended to prevent further influxes of minorities. He presents a theoretical argument
on grievance and opportunity to explain the assumed connection between radical party voting
and violence attributable to racism. To clarify, he theorizes natives attribute their hardships to
refugees and thus violently express grievances against refugee groups when elected political
elites “enable” (actual or perceived) social justifications for doing so. The findings show
Germany experienced the highest level of internal violence involving refugees and minority groups due to a “combination of nationalist rhetoric by established parties and swift and effective
policies restricting the rights of foreigners and refugees” ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>], p. 211).</p>
            <p>A weakness of Koopmans’ study is the lack of specification and operationalization of the
violence measure. The author simply refers to this measure as capturing “extreme right and racist
violent actions” ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>], p. 204). In this quantitative study, different countries have conflicting
definitions and interpretations of what racist violence may be. For example, the “racial violence”
measure for Great Britain could include “threatening behavior or physical attacks” reported by
refugees/native British, whereas the violence measure for Germany required Volksverhetzung
(incitement to racial hatred) influencing an act of violence reported to and involving police
authority ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>], p. 189). Consistent anti-Semitic hate crimes and small-scale acts of violence are an
example of cases frequently included in Koopmans’ analysis. Further, Koopmans concludes that
results are mixed due to other intervening factors such as police presence and aspects of political
party and level of democracy. This study presents an argument for political parties conditioning
the effect of the number of refugees on violent group grievance that is consistent with the
expectation described above that in democracies the level of violence may be higher than that in
autocratic regimes. The underlying theory is that democracies permit grievances to be aired in
the form of public demonstrations that have potential to turn violent, whereas autocracies often
repress such demonstrations from occurring.</p>
            <p>More recently, Krcmaric [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R08">8</xref>] examines social structural factors by considering why refugee
flows may cause conflict in some host states but not others. He argues “refugees cause conflict
when they alter the host state’s ethnic balance of power [in their favor]” ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R08">8</xref>], p. 182). This ethnic
balance of power refers to the host state’s “ethnic contract… a bargain that specifies how groups
divide benefits in accordance with the underlying distribution of power” ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R08">8</xref>], p. 183). He
concludes shifts in relative power may result in shifts of this ethnic contract for social, political,
or resource benefits and thus subsequently incite violence over these changes. In short, refugees
obtaining political or social power (by means of elections or otherwise) may experience an
increase in benefits that citizens may perceive as unjust and use violence to maintain their
perceived claim to existing benefits.</p>
            <p>Krcmaric [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R08">8</xref>] applies theories of bargaining failure and war to the number of refugees and
ethnic violence. Essentially the capacity to negotiate and compromise on territories, laws, and
cultural practices conditions the effect of the relationship between refugee flows and violence.
He examines the case of Serbia’s Kosovo region in 1999 when “animosity” between ethnic
Albanians and native Serbians escalated rapidly as oppressive policies of Serbian president
Slobodan Milosevic fueled growth of resistance groups ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R08">8</xref>], p. 195). After Milosevic launched an
ethnic-cleansing operation against Albanian villages in Serbia hundreds of thousands of citizens
fled south towards Albania and Macedonia. Both of these countries had remarkable social,
geographic, economic, and political similarities with the notable exception of ethnic composition
and sociopolitical tolerance ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R08">8</xref>], pp. 206, 214). Demographically, Macedonia consisted of a Slav
majority with an Albanian minority and Albania was a homogeneously Albanian population.</p>
            <p>As the crisis intensified and over 300,000 Kosovar Albanian refugees crossed into
Macedonia, “ethnic animosity increased and police and border guards allegedly abused refugees”
inciting refugee retaliation and persistent small-scale conflicts thereafter ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R08">8</xref>], p. 206). Refugees
responded by first organizing a group known as the National Liberation Army (NLA) and then
setting demands for the use of Albanian as “the official state language, a new census, an
Albanian university, and greater influence in national politics” due to the radical demographic
shift ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R07">7</xref>], p. 208). Krcmaric argues the sudden influx of Kosovar Albanians in Macedonia “upset
the distribution of latent power and distribution of benefits between the Slav majority and
Albanian minority” ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R08">8</xref>], pp. 196, 207) which incited violent group grievance across the region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>].</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, Albania, incurring over 400,000 Kosovar Albanian refugees, provided
refugees with resources (even homes) to facilitate the mass migration ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R08">8</xref>], p. 212). In doing so,
refugees were reportedly “grateful” and began looking for work in the region to establish cross national relationships and solutions for economic and social prosperity. His findings suggest
Macedonia experienced conflict because civilians perceived refugee flows to “upset the level of
power between the country’s ethnic groups” ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R08">8</xref>], p. 214). Krcmaric argues this stark contrast in
violent or non-violent outcome is attributable to the ethnic balance of power; In essence, there
was no native group to act on a perceived threat, whereas the Slav majority in Macedonia feared
becoming the demographic minority and violently repressed to maintain economic and political
power and the benefits of such power (e.g. territory or job opportunity).</p>
            <p>In sum, existing literature on the connection between refugees and violent group grievance
examines a number of socio-structural, psychological, and political factors that may help explain
cases where the number of refugees result in varying degrees of violence. However, there is a
lack of data and systematic analyses to evaluate different propositions. In this article I examine
this question systematically; I construct a more developed theoretical framework incorporating
both economic and cultural-based theories to articulate why I expect the number of refugees to
result in increased violent group grievance. Then I conduct an analysis that controls for
intervening factors.</p>
         </sec>
         <sec id="s2.2">
            <title>2.2.- Theoretical Framework</title>
            <p>In this section, I argue that the connection between the number of refugees and violent
group grievance can partly be explained by <italic>differences</italic> in culture (e.g. language or religion)
and/or competition for resources. Violence can indeed occur between members of the same
ethnic group. However, this does not align with my theoretical framework to suggest violence
results from language or religious tensions amongst members of the <italic>same</italic> ethnic group (e.g.
Syrians in Germany) since the out-group (i.e. refugees) collectively share an identity which may
violently clash with the in-group (i.e. native citizens) due to cultural differences and/or competition for resources. Thus, controlling for the same/different ethnicity would provide a
more vigorous test of my claim. This would perhaps even allow the possibility to distinguish
between racial and ethnic effects also. Due to data limitations, however, my argument that
violent group grievance can partly be explained by differences in culture remains an assumption
since data does not reveal if refugee groups of a given country, year are of a certain ethnicity.</p>
            <p>I propose the mechanism of social identity and economic interest theory affects violent
group grievance occurring within a state. Differences between social ethnic groups may become
increasingly significant when one group attempts to violently suppress the other in an effort to
protect resources, way of life, or out of xenophobic tension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. Thus, the number of refugees
may increase the level of violent group grievance occurring within a state as differences amongst
the in and out-groups become recognized and stimulate prejudices capable of turning violent.</p>
            <p>Citizens perceiving economic and cultural threats associated with refugees are more
likely to manifest violent group grievance to avoid the damaging effects of this perceived threat
than those who do not, unless the political regime is capable and willing of effective repression
(for instance Egypt and China).</p>
            <p>Sniderman et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>] examine the basis of this civil opposition to immigrant minorities.
Their analysis relies on public opinion survey data collected in The Netherlands from 1997–1998.
Findings suggest that considerations for national identity “dominate those of economic
advantage which evoke exclusionary policies” and anti-immigrant sentiments at large ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>], p. 35).
I examine how economic and cultural factors may result in violence- not just anti-immigrant
sentiments. Scholars such as Rule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R05">5</xref>] incorporate aspects of religion or language into their
definition of culture. My definition of culture includes consideration for racial (i.e. xenophobic)
tension as well.</p>
            <p>By incorporating the possibility for cultural (i.e. racial or ethnic) factors to play a role in
addition to economic and political conditions, we might be able to better understand why states
exhibit violence without resource scarcity. Lake and Rothchild [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>] argued, “ethnic violence is
most often caused by collective fears of the future” ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>], p. 41). They provide a theoretical link
between “collective fears” and ethnic conflict. They argue most ethnic groups coexist quite
harmoniously until “ethnicity is linked with acute social uncertainty, a history of conflict, and
fear of what the future might bring” ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>], p. 43). As these fears arise “states lose their ability to
arbitrate between groups or provide credible guarantees of protection for groups which as central
authority declines, become fearful for their survival” ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>], p. 43). This conflict could then begin
to manifest as the masses begin to fear for the safety and struggle to resolve perceived dilemmas
surrounding culture or resources. It is a distinctly separate condition from a purely economic-driven
assumption to explain why conflict may occur.</p>
            <p>In sum, the number of refugees may result in violent group grievance due to social,
political, and economic conditions. I argue that cultural in addition to economic theories may
help us understand the relationship between the number of refugees and violent group grievance.
Specifically, I rely on the social identity and economic interest theory to examine the relationship
between refugee presence and violent group grievance. I argue that when aspects of group
identities such as ethnicity, language, or religion are impacted by an increase in immigration, the
primary ethnic group may resist the perceived threat(s) posed by refugees. This resistance may
take the form of violent means to 1) prevent their national identity and way of life from being
compromised and 2) protect access to scarce economic resources.</p>
            <p>The social identity theory postulates that perceived threat from conflicting religious
values, and opportunity for misunderstandings based on language or cultural differences can incite protest participation, panic, even violence ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>], pp. 35–36). The premise of this theory is that
individuals of a society exist, interact, and compete across a variety of social groups for relative
power, resources, and benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. In this case, natives of a host country function as the in-group,
while refugees may be treated as the out-group and as a result are targeted for a perceived
threat to in-group way of life and resources.</p>
            <p>The social identity theory is an emotion-based approach to understanding violent group
grievance. Petersen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>] argues that emotion (primarily fear, hatred, and resentment) is a
“mechanism that triggers action to satisfying a pressing concern” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>], p. 17). He argues an
emotion like fear or hatred “raises the saliency of one concern over another and heightens
cognitive and physical capabilities necessary to respond to the situational challenge” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>], p. 17–18). Thus, a native in-group perceiving a threat to aspects of their culture may act on their
negative emotions to preserve their cultural identity and way of life. According to Petersen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]
violent group grievance may occur when 1) a structural change (such as a refugee influx) occurs,
2) the native in-group perceives a threat, and 3) collectively builds emotions such as fear, hatred,
or resentment-based, then 4) act on emotions to resist perceived threats to wellbeing (i.e. cultural
integrity or access to resources) ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>], p. 23). To be clear, he does not propose a mechanism that
turns resentment among the native population into violence. I, however, argue this mechanism is
the perceived threat to culture and/or resources.</p>
            <p>O’Rourke and Sinnott [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>] argue non-economic, cultural factors may even be the main
drivers of anti-immigrant and refugee sentiments. They suggest natives derive utility from
“living in a society with a well-defined sense of national identity and well-understood and
accepted social norms… natives may oppose excessive immigration on the grounds that it
undermines these norms with or without disliking foreigners per se” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>], p. 844). To test these
assumptions O’Rourke and Sinnott [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>] use the 1995 International Social Survey Programme
(ISSP) module on national identity. Citizens from 24 countries were polled from 1995-1996 to
determine the level of anti-immigrant and refugee sentiments. Findings suggest respondents
demonstrated “attitudes towards immigration reflecting nationalist sentiment”, especially when
natives perceive refugees to have limited skills and subsequent contribution to their economy ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>],
p. 857).</p>
            <p>Further, the economic interest theory posits actual or perceived competition for scarce
resources translates into inter-group conflict [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. Rule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R05">5</xref>], Zolberg et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R07">7</xref>], and Krcmaric
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R08">8</xref>] refer to this potential for competition for economic resources to incite conflict between social
groups but do not take into account social factors. Specifically, the social identity argument may
help to explain some of the case anomalies where competition for resources falls short as an
explanation for violent conflict [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>].</p>
            <p>My underlying theoretical assumption then is that citizens of the host country resort to
violence in an attempt to protect 1) existing economic/resource benefits and 2) their cultural
practices and way of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>]. However, developmental, political, and institutional factors are
expected to mitigate the effects of these inflows on conflict. For example, economically
developed states have policies such as labor laws and safety nets that serve as an economic
buffer to “external” influences (such as the number of refugees) which developing countries
often lack ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>], pp. 29–31, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>], p. 84). Further, democratic regimes may experience more conflict
because of constitutional protections for freedom of association such as protests, demonstrations,
and institutions that may mobilize supporters based on such identities of culture (e.g. ethnicity or
religion). Then again, democracies are based on greater tolerance of diversity that may result in
less violence. My model controls for level of democracy that allows for testing of these
alternative effects.</p>
            <p>With recent conflicts such as that of Syria resulting in increased refugees, assumptions
can be made for aspects of social competition and potential for cultural clashes to influence
states (particularly developing states) in profound ways. This research is designed to examine the
level of association between the number of refugees and violent group grievance. Implications
are then derived to tentatively assess the potential value or consequences refugee influxes pose
for the host country.</p>

         <title>3.- Research Design and Variable Operationalization</title>
         <sec id="s3.1">
            <title>3.1.- Dependent Variable</title>
            <p>In this study the dependent variable is violent group grievance. The Fragile States Index
(FSI) states that group grievance is the “tension and violence existing between social groups and
the state’s ability to provide security is undermined allowing the potential for further fear and
violence” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. The Fund for Peace provides this variable by using quantitative and qualitative
analyses to derive a 1 (low levels of violent grievance) -10 (severe violent grievance) value for
178 states annually starting in 2015. Low levels of violent group grievance suggest rare and
relatively less-severe occurrences of ethnic violence (e.g. single hate crime resulting in a single
death), where as high level of violent grievance suggest frequent and severe (i.e. high morbidity
and mortality) acts of ethnic violence (e.g. mass shootings, persecution, violent repression).</p>
            <p>Variable measures comprised within the FSI violent group grievance variable include
discrimination, powerlessness, and intrastate violence. More specifically, this measure of
violence captures “ethnic clashes” such as hate crimes or intrastate conflicts attributable to
discrimination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>]. For example, these violent events must involve <italic>ethnic</italic> clashes rather than interpersonal (e.g. relationships) or criminal (e.g. robbery).
</p>
            <p>“Ethnic” in this context is used to distinguish between the dominant national culture and
that of incoming refugees [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R03">3</xref>]. The main independent variable does not distinguish among ethnic
groups. As such, cases that do not have a dominant culture are included in my analysis; this may
be considered a limitation to this study. The data do not distinguish among native and refugee
ethnic groups. The assumption is that the dominant native culture and the refugee culture vary.</p>
            <p>Further, “group” refers to ethnic groups rather than number of people. To be clear, a case
of a single attacker who stabs a refugee would be included. In short, this measure includes all
intrastate conflict associated with ethnic violence, such as ethnic civil wars or demonstrations
against refugees becoming violent, for example.</p>
         </sec>
         <sec id="s3.2">
            <title>3.2.- Main Independent Variable</title>
            <p>The main independent variable <italic>refugees</italic> is defined as “individuals forced to flee their
country due to persecution, war, or violence with well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of
race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership of a particular social group” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R01">1</xref>]. The
World Bank provides number of refugees by estimating the refugee population by
country/territory of asylum for 264 states annually from 1960-2014. I use <italic>number of refugees</italic> in
the model (not the percent of refugees as a percent of the population) due to the widespread
“visibility” of their presence irrespective of the size of the host state’s population, especially via
the mass media, local and national.</p>
            <p>Based on the previously discussed theoretical mechanism, I expect pressures associated
with the number of refugees to increase violent conflict. The underlying mechanism is citizens
may perceive refugees as a threat to resources or culture, rather than contributing members to a
growing workforce, and engage in violence to preserve their way of life and access to scarce
resources. Civil frustration and ethnic tension may result in hate crimes (i.e. group grievance)
against refugees and small-scale social conflict capable of contributing to a state’s fragility by
means of unlawful violence. A state quickly ending violence could be observed as less fragile,
but the assumption is that strong states with governing authority are able to mitigate, prevent, or
deter the majority of these cases.</p>
         </sec>
         <sec id="s3.3">
            <title>3.3.- Control Variables</title>
            <p>The following control variables are included in the model:</p>
            <p>1. GDP/Capita</p>
            <p>GDP per capita is the gross domestic product divided by midyear population in U.S.
currency. World Bank, the source of these data, operationalize GDP per capita by using the “sum
of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any taxes and minus any
subsidies not included in the value of the products. Calculations do not include deductions for
depreciation of fabricated assets, depletion, or degradation of natural resources” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. The
expected relationship between GDP/Capita and violent group grievance is negative, suggesting
that an increase in GDP/capita will result in fewer grievances. The assumption is that
socioeconomic wellbeing for citizens results in more resources and thus less competition for
such resources and so decreasing the potential for violent grievances.</p>
            <p>2. Human Development Index (HDI)
</p>
            <p>The United Nations Development Programme provides this variable. Rather than just an
economic indicator of development, this variable measures levels in 1) life expectancy, 2)
education, and 3) income [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>]. It is a composite statistic ranging from zero to one. Higher ratings
indicate higher levels of human development.</p>
            <p>I expect higher levels of violent group grievance in developing compared to developed
states. In less developed countries (LDCs) where citizens may face higher unemployment levels
and struggle to secure a living, they may be more vulnerable economically and thus more likely
to compete for already limited resources for survival. In LDCs refugees consuming scarce
resources may be more likely to trigger violence by citizens against perceived contributors to
economic hardship. In developed states where resources are relatively less scarce and thus
competition for resources lower, lower levels of violent group grievance are expected. Further, I
assume that increases in human development address certain grievances (such as economic
hardship), whereas lower levels of human development may be associated with competition for
scarce resources leading to violence.</p>
            <p>3. Democracy</p>
            <p>I utilize two indicators to capture democracy. First, the Polity IV Project provides data on
the level of democracy for 167 countries from 1946-2015. The values range from Autocracy
(-10) to Full Democracy (10). Second, the World Bank created a “Voice and Accountability”
variable to capture perceptions of the “extent to which citizens are able to participate in selecting
their government, as well as freedom of expression, association, and a free media” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. This
variable has a range from -2.5 to 2.5 for a given country, year. Lower values signify weaker
democracy, while higher values signify stronger democracy in relation to the variable description
above. The two indicators are correlated at 0.8395, but there is no multicollinearity to affect tests
of statistical significance.</p>
            <p>Democracies often permit citizens (through constitutions or political doctrine) to
participate in public protests and demonstrations, which have the potential to turn violent as
grievances are aired. Protest demonstrations and alternative institutional arrangements (e.g. political parties and organizations) may be largely suppressed in autocracies, thus less violent
group grievance would be expected. However, democratic institutions are channels for the
expression for citizen grievances so it may be argued that less violence is likely in democracies
than in autocratic regimes. Thus, democracy may be associated positively of negatively with
violent group conflict.</p>
            <p>I expect higher levels of violent group grievance in democratic compared to autocratic
states. In democracies constitutional protections exist for citizens to have the right to participate
in public protests and demonstrations, which have the potential to turn violent as grievances are
aired. Protest demonstrations and alternative institutional arrangements (e.g. political parties and
organizations) may be largely suppressed in autocracies, thus less violent group grievance would
be expected. On the other hand, however, democratic institutions are channels for the expression
for citizen grievances so it may be argued that less violence is likely in democracies than in
autocratic regimes. For example, citizens in a democracy may use the vote to act on their
underlying grievances whereas citizens in autocracies or authoritarian political systems are not
able to participate in elections and therefore may take it upon themselves to act on their
grievances against perceived threats. Therefore, although I expect higher levels of violent group
grievance in democracies than autocracies, the effect may be in the opposite direction.</p>
            <p>4. Control of Corruption</p>
            <p>This variable, a Worldwide Governance Indicator, is operationalized as the
perceptions of the extent to which public power is exercised for private gain. Control of
Corruption also has a range from -2.5 to 2.5 for a given country, year. Similarly, lower values
signify weaker control of corruption, while higher values signify stronger control of corruption in
relation to the variable description.</p>
            <p>I expect the relationship between control of corruption and group grievance to be
negative, suggesting that a government’s inability to control corruption results in an increase in
violent group grievance. This may be due to the allocation of resources to address pressures
resulting from the number of refugees. States that have greater control of corruption may allocate
such resources more effectively (addressing refugees’ needs and citizens’ grievances) thus
containing the level of violence compared to states that have less control of corruption.</p>
            <p>5. Political Stability</p>
            <p>The World Bank operationalizes Political Stability as the perceptions of the likelihood of
politically motivated violence, including acts of terrorism. This measure of politically motivated
violence includes acts of state-sponsored and non-state group acts of terrorism. Non-state group
acts of terrorism are included only if the attack was committed to advance a political cause. By
this definition, I expect the relationship between political stability and violent group grievance to
be negative, suggesting that a government capable of inflicting or permitting politically-motivated
violence on its citizens to also be capable of repressing citizens from committing acts
of violent group grievance.
</p>
            <p>This Worldwide Governance Indicator also has a range from -2.5 to 2.5 for a given
country, year. Lower values signify weaker stability, while higher values signify stronger
stability in relation to the variable description above.</p>
            <p>6. Population Size</p>
            <p>The World Bank contains a variable indicator of population size for country-year, defined
operationally as the number of residents of the state regardless of legal status/citizenship [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>]. I
anticipate a positive relationship between population size and grievance, suggesting that in states
with larger populations the opportunity for violence may be larger than in countries with smaller
populations. On the other hand, larger states are better equipped to deal with refugees and might
also be more diverse, thus lessening the cultural threat perception.</p>

            <title>3.4.- Data and Empirical Strategy</title>
            <p>The unit of analysis for this research design is Country, Year. The sample is 178 countries
from 2006-2014. This timeframe is attributable to data restriction since The Fragile States Index
started in 2005 and thus in the most recent decade data in regard to refugees has become more
robust and available to the public.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, I use a one-year lag for both development (HDI) and control of corruption
since grievances associated with either would likely take time to manifest. I estimate the effects
using a Driscoll-Kraay XT Regression that corrects for heteroskedasticity. I use a cross-sectional
longitudinal (XT) model with fixed effects to assess the relationship between refugee pressures
and violent group grievance.</p>

         <title>4.- Results and Analysis</title>
         <p>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="Tab1">1</xref> shows the effect of the number of refugees on violent group grievance is statistically
significant and in the anticipated direction.</p>
         <p>The regression results indicate that as refugee pressures increase, group grievance also
increases by 5.00e-07 on average [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. To illustrate, an increase in refugees from 100,000 to
200,000 results in an increase of .05 in the index of violent group grievance (a scale from 1 to
10). This finding confirms the main hypothesis of this study on the effect of refugee pressures on
violent group grievance.</p>
         <p>The effect on the dependent variable is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>, which shows the statistically
significant, positive relationship between number of refugees and violent group grievance.
Predicted values of violent group grievance as numbers of refugees increase from zero to three
million are shown on the Y-axis of Figure 1.</p>
         <p>As this figure indicates, high numbers of refugees are not always “necessary” for a state
to experience mid-to-high degrees of violent grievance capable of impacting fragility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>]. This
finding suggests that number of refugees is an important determinant of state fragility. As such,
the inclusion of refugees belongs in the security studies literature.</p>
         <p>All control variables are statistically significant. However, four coefficients are not in the
direction expected. First, the relationship between GDP/capita and violent group grievance is
positive; suggesting increased GDP/capita results in more violent group grievance. This finding
appears to be reinforcing the argument made by Sniderman et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>] that cultural factors may
account for violent conflict even in circumstances where there is relative economic prosperity.
However, the unanticipated negative effect needs to be investigated further. To be sure, GDP/per capita is not an indicator of wealth distribution, or level of economic inequality that
may be a better predictor of violent group grievance.</p>
         <p>Second, the relationship between HDI and violent group grievance is also positive.
While contrary to initial expectation, the finding mirrors that of GDP/capita therefore not
surprising. This finding suggests that an increase in development in terms of education, longevity,
and income also results in increased violent group grievance. This may be attributable to
civilians violently resisting perceived threats from the number of refugees to protect current
benefits associated with development.</p>
         <p>Third, the relationship between voice and accountability and violent group grievance is
positive, suggesting that an increase of <italic>freedom of expression, association</italic>, and <italic>free media</italic> is
associated with an increase in violent grievance. This may suggest the freedom to express
grievances has potential to turn violent (e.g. protests resulting into riots).</p>
         <p>Lastly, the relationship between level of democracy and violent group grievance is
positive, suggesting that increased democracy results in more violent group grievance. The
rationale may reside in autocratic elites being able to effectively oppress citizen opposition and
violence before violent group grievances increase. In contrast, democratic states permitting
expression of grievances (e.g. protests) may indirectly permit increased opportunity for violence
to erupt.</p>
         <p>Because of the unexpected directions of these coefficients, I test for multicollinearity to
determine potentially highly collinear measures amongst the Worldwide Governance Indicators.
Voice and accountability, control of corruption, and political stability were highly correlated, but
further testing revealed that controlling for this collinearity did not affect the statistical
significance or direction of any variables.</p>

         <title>5.- Limitations and Conclusion</title>
         <p>This research examines the relationship between the number of refugees and violent
group grievance. The main hypothesis in this study was confirmed while controlling for a variety
of factors associated with violent group grievance as an indicator of state fragility’s dimension of
authority. This first large-N quantitative analysis is consistent with findings in the literature that
number of refugees result in increased violent group grievance. I argue the theoretical
mechanism for this relationship to be social competition for resources and preservation of
cultural identity.</p>
         <p>In conclusion, states experiencing economic or cultural pressures associated with
refugees may experience increased violent group grievance and thus increased fragility. My
findings imply that richer, democratic states are more fragile in this context than less developed,
autocratic states. This contradicts assumptions in the literature on fragile states suggesting rich
democracies are often less fragile than poor developing countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>]. Improving data and exploring
other potential determinants of violent group grievance may help researchers to better understand
the mechanism and dynamics of this association.</p>
         <p>Now, a limitation of this study is that <italic>violent group grievance</italic> does not distinguish
empirically between violence against refugees and that against immigrants. Rather, the measure
captures ethnic violence, specifically hate crimes and conflicts attributable to discrimination.
Such violence, to be sure, may include acts of violence committed against immigrants; however,
it is not possible to deconstruct this index since each value of this variable is based on
quantitative and qualitative data I do not have access to. To account in part for this limitation I
attempted to locate data on the number of immigrants to include it in the analysis as a control
variable. However, such data were not available for the cases and years included in my study.</p>
         <p>Another limitation of this study is that I assume that each country in the data sample has a
“dominant” culture that is different from that of the refugees. Refugees that have the same
culture as that of the dominant group or a group in the host state may experience less violent
group grievance; but I do not test for this effect.</p>
         <p>Lastly, I incorporate a variety of economic (e.g. GDP/capita), social (e.g. human
development, democracy), political (e.g. corruption, stability) and demographic (e.g. population
size) variables to examine the relationship between the number of refugees and violent group
grievance. However, I am unable to test certain cultural factors (e.g. language differences) across
all countries due to data and empirical limitations. For example, I do not examine every refugee
group’s relationship with all other countries (e.g. Syrian refugees in every host country outside of
Syria with consideration for language differences), which deviates heavily from an exploratory
study on violent group grievance to less-related aspects outside this study’s analytical scope.
This large-N quantitative analysis is meant to provide an overall interpretation of the number of
refugees and violent group grievance with available data.</p>
