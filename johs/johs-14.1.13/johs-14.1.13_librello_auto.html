In this article I examine whether
                                 refugee inflows, commonly associated in the literature with economic and cultural
                                 pressures, result in a more fragile state by means of increased violent group grievance.
                                 Violent group grievance captures a distinct form of intrastate violence, specifically
                                 small-scale hate crimes and ethnic group clashes associated with powerlessness and
                                 discrimination. The main hypothesis in this paper is that refugee inflows may increase
                                 violent group grievance. I examine the effect of refugee inflows on the level of domestic
                                 violent group grievance using quantitative analyses based on original large-N datasets
                                 and cross-sectional longitudinal models to fill gaps in the literature on state fragility.
                                 This study controls for alternative explanations and covers the time period between
                                 2006 and 2014. The analysis results confirm the main hypothesis of this paper.</span></div>

                              <p id="d1e73">Do refugee inflows have an effect on state fragility? In this article I examine whether
                                 the number
                                 of refugees, commonly associated in the literature with cultural and economic pressures
                                 in the
                                 host country, result in a more fragile state by means of increased violent group grievance.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e75">Refugees are defined in this study as “individuals forced to flee their country due
                                 to persecution,
                                 war, or violence with well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion,
                                 nationality,
                                 political opinion, or membership of a particular social group” [<a href="#R01">1</a>]. According to the Fragile States
                                 Index (FSI), violent group grievance is the “violence existing between social groups”
                                 [<a href="#R02">2</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e83">Violent group grievance captures a distinct form of intrastate violence, specifically
                                 hate crimes
                                 and ethnic group clashes associated with powerlessness and discrimination. In particular,
                                 this
                                 measure of violence captures “ethnic clashes” such as hate crimes or intrastate conflicts
                                 attributable to discrimination. My main hypothesis in this paper is that as the number
                                 of refugees
                                 increases violent group grievance due to economic and cultural conflict between refugees
                                 and
                                 citizens also increases.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e85">I expect the primary participants in this conflict to be the minority refugee group
                                 and
                                 citizens (i.e. natives) of the host country. Other actors such as government officials
                                 (e.g.
                                 governing elites, their armed forces, and police) or “external” participants (e.g.
                                 Peace Officers,
                                 foreign militaries) may also intervene in the conflict to prevent persecution or influence
                                 the
                                 outcome. In this paper I focus on the conflict by which citizens violently resist
                                 refugees due to
                                 shared perceptions that they may have the most to lose (e.g. job security, cultural
                                 integrity,
                                 political influence) to refugees. The foundation of the argument is that refugees
                                 increase ethnic diversity which in turn may lead to violent group grievance. In contrast,
                                 refugee absence equates
                                 to less ethnic diversity and thus less violent group grievances, as defined in this
                                 article.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e87">By committing violence against the refugees, citizens may believe they protect their
                                 economic security (e.g. employment opportunities) and assumed dominant national culture
                                 including traditional and religious practices. In short, citizens may view refugees
                                 as an economic
                                 and/or cultural threat. Thus, they may engage in violence over preexisting economic
                                 resources
                                 and cultural traditions. The dependent variable provided by the Fragile States Index
                                 involves
                                 only measures of violence such as hate crimes or intrastate conflicts attributable
                                 to ethnic clashes. Further, this study assumes that there is a ‘dominant’ national
                                 culture and tradition in the host
                                 state; it does not account for cases where the incoming refugees are of the same culture
                                 as the
                                 host state’s culture or that of a major group in the state [<a href="#R03">3</a>]. In this paper, the concept of “culture”
                                 is defined as linguistic, religious, ethnic, and racial elements which individuals
                                 often
                                 subconsciously use to create their sociocultural identities. For example, cultural
                                 (or even
                                 subcultural) differences could be as overt as religious practices and appearance (e.g.
                                 wearing
                                 yarmulke, burka, etc.) or as subtle as an accent variation of the same language (e.g.
                                 British vs. American English).
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e92">I begin with a literature review on the connection between violent group grievance
                                 and
                                 the number of refugees. I then construct a theoretical framework based on economic
                                 interest
                                 theory and social identity theory to examine the mechanism of the relationship between
                                 the
                                 number of refugees and associated pressures (i.e. cultural differences and competition
                                 for
                                 resources) and violent group grievance (i.e. hate crimes and intrastate violence attributable
                                 to
                                 ethnic clashes). I proceed to describe the research design, data, and methodology
                                 to test for these
                                 effects. Finally, I describe the findings of my analysis and conclude.

                              <p id="d1e97">Intrastate violence can manifest in a multitude of ways ranging from small-scale hate
                                 crimes and homicides to mass-casualty civil war. This literature review focuses solely
                                 on one
                                 specific form of unlawful violence: violent group grievance. Unlike the voluminous
                                 literature on
                                 civil war, violent group grievance remains largely understudied, which is surprising
                                 given the
                                 increase of intrastate violence since the Second World War ([<a href="#R04">4</a>], p. 3). I first discuss existing
                                 literature on the relationship between violent group grievance and refugees and then
                                 proceed to
                                 discuss the theoretical framework of this study that addresses some of the shortcomings
                                 in the
                                 violent group grievance literature.

                                    <p id="d1e105">In the literature the connection between violent group grievance and refugees is
                                       understudied. The existing literature on refugees and violent group grievance is based
                                       mainly on
                                       qualitative studies. A review of existing literature reveals two main findings: the
                                       presence of
                                       refugees 1) incites violence [<a href="#R05">5</a>, <a href="#R06">6</a>, <a href="#R07">7</a>] and 2) has a mixed or neutral effect on violence [<a href="#R08">8</a>, <a href="#R09">9</a>, <a href="#R10">10</a>].
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e126">Rule [<a href="#R05">5</a>] argues that ethnic violence associated with refugee presence may be attributable
                                       to differences amongst social groups. These differences can be political representation,
                                       access to
                                       resources, or tolerance of contrasting cultural practices such as religion or language.
                                       Rule
                                       hypothesizes these differences can build to a point of social frustration within a
                                       society that may
                                       lead to “violent action, not often directed against governments after all, but against
                                       members of
                                       antagonistic ethnic, racial, or religious groups” (p. 204). Rule does not address
                                       the mechanism of
                                       the connection between social differences and frustration, but does hypothesize a
                                       positive effect
                                       of frustration on violence. He argues the “primary source of the human capacity for
                                       violence
                                       appears to be the frustration-aggression mechanism…If frustrations are sufficiently
                                       prolonged or sharply felt, aggression is quite likely [whereby] men who are frustrated
                                       have an innate
                                       disposition to do violence in proportion to the intensity of their frustration” ([<a href="#R05">5</a>], p. 202). The
                                       essence of the theory suggests intergroup frustration amongst refugees and natives
                                       has potential
                                       to turn violent when individuals perceive “indignation or perceived injustice” ([<a href="#R05">5</a>], p. 202).
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e137">To be sure, “frustration” is neither a necessary nor sufficient condition for social
                                       conflict.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e139">There are other mediating factors not addressed in Rule’s analytical framework. To
                                       illustrate,
                                       there are cases where individuals of a population suffer, even starve to death, but
                                       still do not
                                       engage in violent conflict. An example would be the Islamic Republic of Iran, which
                                       is
                                       considered amongst the most ethnically diverse and politically corrupt countries annually
                                       with
                                       over 12 million civilians experiencing starvation (largely attributable to sanctions
                                       imposed by the
                                       United States) [<a href="#R11">11</a>, <a href="#R12">12</a>]. Members of ten primary ethnic groups in Iran (e.g. Persians, Azerbaijanis,
                                       Kurds, Lurs, etc.) experience food poverty and immense repression from their government
                                       yet do
                                       not engage in violent conflict against their government, one another, or refugees.
                                       Thus, other
                                       factors may be present under which conflict may or may not manifest from civil frustration.
                                       Group grievances are also channeled via non-violent group resistance, such as exclusion
                                       of
                                       minorities from positions of authority, which in fact is more prevalent than violent
                                       group
                                       resistance [<a href="#R06">6</a>]. However, non-violent group resistance is beyond the scope of this analysis.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e150">Gurr [<a href="#R13">13</a>] discusses this frustration-aggression mechanism with reference to relative
                                       deprivation. Relative deprivation theory states there are perceived capacities (or
                                       value
                                       expectations) which have potential to create social comparison and in some cases violence
                                       ([<a href="#R13">13</a>], p. 22). Specifically, this “destructive behavior [violence] incites as circumstances
                                       and quality of life
                                       change and groups experience a lack of satisfaction and subsequent frustration” ([<a href="#R13">13</a>], p. 22). In this
                                       case, for example, natives may blame refugees as if they perceive diminishing economic
                                       wellbeing if resources or job opportunities are limited. Thus, natives may compare
                                       their
                                       economic resources or perceived economic wellbeing before and after the arrival of
                                       refugees,
                                       become frustrated, and in some cases violently resist.

                                    <p id="d1e161">According to Zolberg et al. [<a href="#R07">7</a>] rapid, basic transformation of a society’s state and class
                                       structures may lead to violence attributable to inequality and oppression of “subordinate
                                       classes”
                                       including refugees and peasants ([<a href="#R07">7</a>], p. 245). Zolberg et al. [<a href="#R07">7</a>] argue minorities are frequently the
                                       victims of small-scale violent conflict because they lack the resource capacity to
                                       flee elsewhere
                                       ([<a href="#R07">7</a>], p. 256–257). This factor of availability of group resources at the time of societal
                                       changes may
                                       condition the relationship in ways Rule [<a href="#R05">5</a>] does not take into account. Zolberg et al. did not
                                       systematically test the relationship between radical social transformation and violence,
                                       but they
                                       do make a probabilistic argument that rapid social transformation [10](i.e. effects
                                       of globalization) may lead to ethnic violence where neither society nor the state
                                       is capable of effectively managing
                                       distribution of economic resources, territories, etc. between natives and refugees
                                       ([<a href="#R07">7</a>], p. 256–257).
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e182">The latter findings suggest that refugees may have a mixed or neutral effect on violent
                                       group grievance as argued by Richmond and Valtonen [<a href="#R10">10</a>]. Richmond and Valtonen argue that
                                       “state sovereignty can no longer be maintained in an absolute way… where boundaries
                                       are
                                       permeable for money, goods, and information but not for people” ([<a href="#R10">10</a>], p. 205). He suggests that
                                       economic and developmental factors condition the effect of the number of refugees
                                       on conflict,
                                       which he examines via a qualitative analysis on “catalysts of social, economic, and
                                       political
                                       change rooted in migration pressures” ([<a href="#R10">10</a>], p. 26). According to Richmond and Valtonen, the
                                       presence of refugees often has a mixed effect on violence depending on whether political
                                       institutions provide economic opportunity and integration for refugees in the labor
                                       market ([<a href="#R10">10</a>], p. 26). Opportunity in this context refers to refugee capacity to joining the workforce
                                       as a driving factor of a growing economy. In contrast, when host countries (such as
                                       South Africa in the
                                       1950s) do not provide aid in terms of social services (e.g. job placement or welfare
                                       for the
                                       unemployed) conflict may be more likely ([<a href="#R10">10</a>], p. 25). Thus, for Richmond and Valtonen an
                                       important factor that may affect the level of violent group conflict is the state
                                       policies aimed at
                                       incorporating refugees in the economy and labor market; in other words the driving
                                       factor in
                                       conflict avoidance is the host country’s capacity of providing economic opportunity.

                                    <p id="d1e199">To my knowledge, there are no systematic studies that examine directly the relationship
                                       between institutional arrangements for economic integration and violence.

                                    <p id="d1e201">Koopmans [<a href="#R11">11</a>] takes into account political factors that may explain violent group
                                       grievance. He examines European cases from 1988 to 1993 to assess the apparent effect
                                       of the
                                       number of refugees on internal violence and voting for radical parties of the right.

                                       explores whether or not the presence of refugees has an effect on violent ethnic conflict
                                       and right
                                       wing voting intended to prevent further influxes of minorities. He presents a theoretical
                                       argument
                                       on grievance and opportunity to explain the assumed connection between radical party

                                       and violence attributable to racism. To clarify, he theorizes natives attribute their
                                       hardships to
                                       refugees and thus violently express grievances against refugee groups when elected

                                       of the
                                       violence measure. The author simply refers to this measure as capturing “extreme right

                                       definitions and interpretations of what racist violence may be. For example, the “racial
                                       violence”
                                       measure for Great Britain could include “threatening behavior or physical attacks”
                                       reported by
                                       refugees/native British, whereas the violence measure for Germany required Volksverhetzung
                                       (incitement to racial hatred) influencing an act of violence reported to and involving

                                       example of cases frequently included in Koopmans’ analysis. Further, Koopmans concludes
                                       that
                                       results are mixed due to other intervening factors such as police presence and aspects

                                       expectation described above that in democracies the level of violence may be higher
                                       than that in
                                       autocratic regimes. The underlying theory is that democracies permit grievances to
                                       be aired in
                                       the form of public demonstrations that have potential to turn violent, whereas autocracies
                                       often
                                       repress such demonstrations from occurring.

                                       balance of power refers to the host state’s “ethnic contract… a bargain that specifies

                                       divide benefits in accordance with the underlying distribution of power” ([<a href="#R08">8</a>], p. 183). He

                                       Albanians and native Serbians escalated rapidly as oppressive policies of Serbian

                                       fled south towards Albania and Macedonia. Both of these countries had remarkable social,

                                       majority with an Albanian minority and Albania was a homogeneously Albanian population.

                                       examines a number of socio-structural, psychological, and political factors that may
                                       help explain
                                       cases where the number of refugees result in varying degrees of violence. However,

                                       group grievance can partly be explained by <i>differences</i> in culture (e.g. language or religion)
                                       and/or competition for resources. Violence can indeed occur between members of the
                                       same
                                       ethnic group. However, this does not align with my theoretical framework to suggest
                                       violence
                                       results from language or religious tensions amongst members of the <i>same</i> ethnic group (e.g.
                                       Syrians in Germany) since the out-group (i.e. refugees) collectively share an identity
                                       which may
                                       violently clash with the in-group (i.e. native citizens) due to cultural differences
                                       and/or competition for resources. Thus, controlling for the same/different ethnicity
                                       would provide a
                                       more vigorous test of my claim. This would perhaps even allow the possibility to distinguish
                                       between racial and ethnic effects also. Due to data limitations, however, my argument

                                       advantage which evoke exclusionary policies” and anti-immigrant sentiments at large
                                       ([<a href="#R16">16</a>], p. 35).
                                       I examine how economic and cultural factors may result in violence- not just anti-immigrant
                                       sentiments. Scholars such as Rule [<a href="#R05">5</a>] incorporate aspects of religion or language into their
                                       definition of culture. My definition of culture includes consideration for racial
                                       (i.e. xenophobic)
                                       tension as well.

                                       addition to economic and political conditions, we might be able to better understand
                                       why states
                                       exhibit violence without resource scarcity. Lake and Rothchild [<a href="#R17">17</a>] argued, “ethnic violence is
                                       most often caused by collective fears of the future” ([<a href="#R17">17</a>], p. 41). They provide a theoretical link
                                       between “collective fears” and ethnic conflict. They argue most ethnic groups coexist
                                       quite
                                       harmoniously until “ethnicity is linked with acute social uncertainty, a history of
                                       conflict, and
                                       fear of what the future might bring” ([<a href="#R17">17</a>], p. 43). As these fears arise “states lose their ability to
                                       arbitrate between groups or provide credible guarantees of protection for groups which
                                       as central
                                       authority declines, become fearful for their survival” ([<a href="#R17">17</a>], p. 43). This conflict could then begin
                                       to manifest as the masses begin to fear for the safety and struggle to resolve perceived
                                       dilemmas
                                       surrounding culture or resources. It is a distinctly separate condition from a purely

                                       assumption to explain why conflict may occur.

                                       political, and economic conditions. I argue that cultural in addition to economic
                                       theories may
                                       help us understand the relationship between the number of refugees and violent group
                                       grievance.
                                       Specifically, I rely on the social identity and economic interest theory to examine
                                       the relationship
                                       between refugee presence and violent group grievance. I argue that when aspects of
                                       group
                                       identities such as ethnicity, language, or religion are impacted by an increase in
                                       immigration, the
                                       primary ethnic group may resist the perceived threat(s) posed by refugees. This resistance
                                       may
                                       take the form of violent means to 1) prevent their national identity and way of life
                                       from being
                                       compromised and 2) protect access to scarce economic resources.

                                       values, and opportunity for misunderstandings based on language or cultural differences
                                       can incite protest participation, panic, even violence ([<a href="#R16">16</a>], pp. 35–36). The premise of this theory is that
                                       individuals of a society exist, interact, and compete across a variety of social groups
                                       for relative

                                       while refugees may be treated as the out-group and as a result are targeted for a

                                       grievance. Petersen [<a href="#R20">20</a>] argues that emotion (primarily fear, hatred, and resentment) is a
                                       “mechanism that triggers action to satisfying a pressing concern” [<a href="#R20">20</a>], p. 17). He argues an
                                       emotion like fear or hatred “raises the saliency of one concern over another and heightens
                                       cognitive and physical capabilities necessary to respond to the situational challenge”
                                       [<a href="#R20">20</a>], p. 17–18). Thus, a native in-group perceiving a threat to aspects of their culture
                                       may act on their
                                       negative emotions to preserve their cultural identity and way of life. According to
                                       Petersen [<a href="#R20">20</a>]
                                       violent group grievance may occur when 1) a structural change (such as a refugee influx)
                                       occurs,
                                       2) the native in-group perceives a threat, and 3) collectively builds emotions such
                                       as fear, hatred,
                                       or resentment-based, then 4) act on emotions to resist perceived threats to wellbeing
                                       (i.e. cultural

                                       turns resentment among the native population into violence. I, however, argue this
                                       mechanism is
                                       the perceived threat to culture and/or resources.

                                       “living in a society with a well-defined sense of national identity and well-understood

                                       assumptions O’Rourke and Sinnott [<a href="#R21">21</a>] use the 1995 International Social Survey Programme
                                       (ISSP) module on national identity. Citizens from 24 countries were polled from 1995-1996

                                       because of constitutional protections for freedom of association such as protests,

                                       organizations) may be largely suppressed in autocracies, thus less violent group grievance
                                       would
                                       be expected. On the other hand, however, democratic institutions are channels for
                                       the expression
                                       for citizen grievances so it may be argued that less violence is likely in democracies
                                       than in
                                       autocratic regimes. For example, citizens in a democracy may use the vote to act on
                                       their
                                       underlying grievances whereas citizens in autocracies or authoritarian political systems
                                       are not
                                       able to participate in elections and therefore may take it upon themselves to act
                                       on their
                                       grievances against perceived threats. Therefore, although I expect higher levels of
                                       violent group
                                       grievance in democracies than autocracies, the effect may be in the opposite direction.

                                 the inclusion of refugees belongs in the security studies literature.

                                 direction expected. First, the relationship between GDP/capita and violent group grievance

                                 positive; suggesting increased GDP/capita results in more violent group grievance.

                                 appears to be reinforcing the argument made by Sniderman et al. [<a href="#R16">16</a>] that cultural factors may
                                 account for violent conflict even in circumstances where there is relative economic
                                 prosperity.
                                 However, the unanticipated negative effect needs to be investigated further. To be
                                 sure, GDP/per capita is not an indicator of wealth distribution, or level of economic
                                 inequality that
                                 may be a better predictor of violent group grievance.

                              <p id="d1e556">Second, the relationship between HDI and violent group grievance is also positive.
                                 While contrary to initial expectation, the finding mirrors that of GDP/capita therefore
                                 not
                                 surprising. This finding suggests that an increase in development in terms of education,

                                 and income also results in increased violent group grievance. This may be attributable
                                 to
                                 civilians violently resisting perceived threats from the number of refugees to protect

                              <p id="d1e793">This research examines the relationship between the number of refugees and violent
                                 group grievance. The main hypothesis in this study was confirmed while controlling
                                 for a variety
                                 of factors associated with violent group grievance as an indicator of state fragility’s
                                 dimension of
                                 authority. This first large-N quantitative analysis is consistent with findings in
                                 the literature that
                                 number of refugees result in increased violent group grievance. I argue the theoretical
                                 mechanism for this relationship to be social competition for resources and preservation
                                 of
                                 cultural identity.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e795">In conclusion, states experiencing economic or cultural pressures associated with
                                 refugees may experience increased violent group grievance and thus increased fragility.
                                 My
                                 findings imply that richer, democratic states are more fragile in this context than
                                 less developed,
                                 autocratic states. This contradicts assumptions in the literature on fragile states
                                 suggesting rich
                                 democracies are often less fragile than poor developing countries [<a href="#R36">36</a>]. Improving data and exploring
                                 other potential determinants of violent group grievance may help researchers to better
                                 understand
                                 the mechanism and dynamics of this association.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e800">Now, a limitation of this study is that <i>violent group grievance</i> does not distinguish
                                 empirically between violence against refugees and that against immigrants. Rather,
                                 the measure
                                 captures ethnic violence, specifically hate crimes and conflicts attributable to discrimination.
                                 Such violence, to be sure, may include acts of violence committed against immigrants;
                                 however,
                                 it is not possible to deconstruct this index since each value of this variable is
                                 based on
                                 quantitative and qualitative data I do not have access to. To account in part for
                                 this limitation I
                                 attempted to locate data on the number of immigrants to include it in the analysis
                                 as a control
                                 variable. However, such data were not available for the cases and years included in
                                 my study.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e805">Another limitation of this study is that I assume that each country in the data sample
                                 has a
                                 “dominant” culture that is different from that of the refugees. Refugees that have
                                 the same
                                 culture as that of the dominant group or a group in the host state may experience
                                 less violent
                                 group grievance; but I do not test for this effect.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e807">Lastly, I incorporate a variety of economic (e.g. GDP/capita), social (e.g. human
                                 development, democracy), political (e.g. corruption, stability) and demographic (e.g.
                                 population
                                 size) variables to examine the relationship between the number of refugees and violent
                                 group
                                 grievance. However, I am unable to test certain cultural factors (e.g. language differences)
                                 across
                                 all countries due to data and empirical limitations. For example, I do not examine
                                 every refugee
                                 group’s relationship with all other countries (e.g. Syrian refugees in every host
                                 country outside of
                                 Syria with consideration for language differences), which deviates heavily from an
                                 exploratory
                                 study on violent group grievance to less-related aspects outside this study’s analytical
                                 scope.
                                 This large-N quantitative analysis is meant to provide an overall interpretation of
                                 the number of
                                 refugees and violent group grievance with available data.
