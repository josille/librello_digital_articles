To
                                 deal with this menace, both the government and non-governmental organizations have
                                 taken steps at various levels to improve police service delivery, competence-building
                                 and awareness-raising on GBV, establish women’s shelters, establish women’s development
                                 and welfare units in district welfare departments, and open helplines. However, these
                                 initiatives are limited, scattered and lack coordination. Our research aims to understand
                                 how the introduction of ICT might improve both competence on GBV and the coordination
                                 of the mechanisms dealing with GBV. Using a qualitative approach, we conducted in-depth
                                 interviews of relevant actors involved in the process of dealing with GBV. Our research
                                 findings show that GBV is a deeply rooted and complex structural phenomenon that requires
                                 a well-planned, well-coordinated and politically driven strategy. While ICT has the
                                 potential to improve competence of stakeholder and processes of reporting, mitigating
                                 and preventing GBV, access to technology by rural women is limited. It is therefore
                                 important that technological innovations take account of contextual constraints and
                                 opportunities.</span></div>

                              <p id="d1e97">In Pakistan, gender-based violence is a widespread social issue which is increasing
                                 at an alarming rate. Women are subjected to numerous types of gender based violence
                                 including spousal murders, acid burning, burned alive, beatings, psychological torture
                                 and the traditional honor killings [<a href="#R1">1</a>]. Women must bear violence and discrimination on a daily basis, often justified by
                                 a conservative interpretation of social and cultural values and religious norms [<a href="#R2">2</a>, <a href="#R3">3</a>]. Structural patriarchy in Pakistan gives control of women’s lives to their male
                                 counterparts, including their behavior, mobility, control over resources and productive
                                 and reproductive choices. The mansplaining of violence defends violence against women
                                 by taking various Quranic verses out of their context to justify violence for a ‘disciplinary
                                 act’ [<a href="#R4">4</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e111">States are responsible for mitigating patriarchy and gender-based violence through
                                 their legal systems [<a href="#R5">5</a>]. Additionally, the state can play a role in breaking the patriarchal norms which
                                 are harmful for their marginalized population [<a href="#R6">6</a>]. The Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan (1973) guarantees Human Rights
                                 protection through Fundamental Rights and the Principles of Policy as specified under
                                 Articles 8-28 and 29-40 respectively. The Government of Pakistan, in view of its vision
                                 2025, and its commitment to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals in respect
                                 of vulnerable segments of the society, has given due priority to human rights observance
                                 in Pakistan [<a href="#R7">7</a>]. Pakistan has, both at the Federal and Provincial levels, have enacted legislation
                                 to protect women against sexual harassment, forced marriages, denial of inheritance,
                                 acid attacks and ‘honor killings’. In 2004, different amendments were made in Pakistan
                                 Penal Code (PPC) and the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) [<a href="#R8">8</a>]. In addition to relevant federal laws, the Federal Government has also established
                                 the National Commission on the Status of Women under the National Commission on the
                                 Status of Women Act 2012 to monitor and facilitate implementation of laws for the
                                 protection of women [<a href="#R9">9</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e128">This study is set in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Province of Pakistan which is one of
                                 the most challenging provinces to work in on issues related to gender-based violence.
                                 There has always been an opposition and resistance to the passing of pro-women laws,
                                 a high prevalence of violence, and poor mobility for women and girls. The 2012–2013
                                 Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey (PDHS) stated that KP has the highest percentages
                                 in the country for women who have ever experienced physical and/or emotional violence.
                                 As in many societies, victims of sexual violence in KP also feel stigmatized, which
                                 inhibits reporting. After the passing of the 18th Amendment [<a href="#R10">10</a>] and international commitment to decentralize the process of making policies to tackle
                                 the gender based violence, a number of provincial legislations were adopted by Khyber
                                 Pakhtunkhwa to mitigate gender-based violence in the province i.e. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
                                 Elimination of Custom of Ghag Act 2013, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Deserving Widows and Special
                                 Persons Welfare Foundation Act 2014, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Promotion, Protection and
                                 Enforcement of Human Rights Act 2014, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Commission on the Status
                                 of Women Act 2016, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Harassment of Women at workplace (amendment)
                                 Act, 2017 [<a href="#R11">11</a>]. KP has also taken measures for women’s political representation in the Provincial
                                 Assembly (17%) and in local governments (30%).
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e136">Post devolution of power, KP enacted <i>‘‘Laissaail e Wal Mahroom’’</i> Foundation Act, 2015 to support women and special persons. The Government of KP has
                                 also established a Commission on the Status of Women under the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
                                 Commission on the Status of Women Act (KPCSW) in 2016. Moreover, a provincial Women’s
                                 Empowerment Policy has been launched in 2015 in pursuance of the province’s commitment
                                 to gender equality and mitigate gender-based violence. There have also been attempts
                                 to use ICTs to address GBV in the province. The KP government launched a new smartphone
                                 application to assist women experiencing gender-based violence and improve the services
                                 it offers via the KPCSW. The app, named KPCSW also works offline. It contains features
                                 like text, voice and video messages, and MMS, to help women report cases of violence.
                                 People can also access useful information regarding laws protecting women and how

                                 violence. Women Desks have also been setup in the provincial capital on a pilot basis
                                 in collaboration with Police Department to curb gender-based violence. Similarly,
                                 the Departments of Zakat, Ushr, Social Welfare, Special Education &amp; Women Empowerment
                                 look after various marginalized segments of the population such as poor, destitute
                                 women, persons with disabilities, orphans, victims of violence and drug addicts through
                                 established institutions and autonomous bodies across the Province.

                              <p id="d1e141">Despite of all these initiatives, KP police data shows an increase in the number of
                                 domestic violence cases registered in 2019, especially in murder and battery. In 2018,
                                 180 women were murdered in their households. In 2019, the figure rose to 217. Thirty-six
                                 women reported physical abuse at home in 2019, three times more than in 2018 [<a href="#R12">12</a>]. Despite the efforts made by the provincial government to address GBV, more needs
                                 to be done to empower women in social, cultural, economic, political, and legislative
                                 process in both public and private life. And while progressive and pro women legislation
                                 ensuring the safety and security of women in political, social, and economic spheres
                                 exists, the implementation of these legislations is a big question mark. One of the
                                 reasons for the lack of implementation could be little or no willingness by the executive,
                                 which predominantly is dominated by men, while another could be strong conservative

                              <p id="d1e149">Keeping in view the complexity, this paper investigates the tension that exists in
                                 understanding the issue of GBV i.e. whether it is a personal issue or a social issue;
                                 a dispute or a crime, and how the nature and meaning of GBV changes with the approach
                                 one follows in understanding the issue. GBV and related crimes are clearly mentioned
                                 in laws, community policing guidelines, policies, and gender training and awareness
                                 programs. However, it is not internalized and institutionalized in effective structures
                                 and practices; the attempts made to address the issue have been mostly cosmetic and
                                 inadequate. Rather than taking ownership, the government has engaged NGOs to address
                                 the issue, resulting in further lack of ownership. The competence is low in police
                                 in dealing with GBV issues. There exists lack of knowledge of laws and their role
                                 in dealing with victims and prevention. There is an acute need for training that is
                                 both effective and accessible to police and community on how to deal with and prevent
                                 GBV. Based on local understandings of GBV, and the barriers that exist in addressing
                                 these issues through policy, legal, technical and social means, this paper explores
                                 the potential of ICT’s to increase the competence of police, civil society and community
                                 by making the relevant information and knowledge available and accessible to relevant
                                 stakeholders. The paper begins with a theoretical framework followed by the methods
                                 employed. We then present our findings and discussion based on a case study of rural
                                 Mansehra, Pakistan We begin by identifying the relevant actors involved in the GBV
                                 prevention mechanism and explore their roles and responsibilities, strengths and weaknesses.
                                 We then move to a discussion of the possibilities of using ICTs to address some of
                                 these challenges and improve coordination, prevention and response to gender-based
                                 violence.

                                    <p id="d1e159">The fundamental concept that is used in this research study is human security. Human
                                       security refers to the way in which men and women struggle in daily lives to ensure
                                       their wellbeing and security/ insecurity from various forms violence both visible
                                       and invisible. Human security has multiple definitions ranging from the popular view
                                       of security as the prevention of violence, to broader perspectives including the provision
                                       of basic life necessities. As illustrated by Tadjbakhsh and Chenoy (2007), the concepts
                                       of security and insecurity have relatively different understandings in different contexts.
                                       For some people, insecurity comes from economic loss; however, for others it comes
                                       from extremism, violation of human rights, conflicts etc. The same authors suggest
                                       that ‘‘Security needs to be redefined as a subjective experience at the micro-level
                                       in terms of people’s experience’’ [<a href="#R14">14</a>], p.&nbsp;2). Human security is a contested term, in the fields of both international
                                       relations and development studies. It has emerged as a new concept, acting as an entry
                                       point for critical analysis, a worldview, political agenda or paradigm shift [<a href="#R14">14</a>]. The 1994 Human Development Report: New Dimensions of Human Security presented by
                                       the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) has proven to be groundbreaking in this
                                       field. As Timothy [<a href="#R15">15</a>] notes, the report stresses that social and economic insecurity endangers international
                                       stability: For too long, nations have sought arms to protect their security. For most
                                       people today, a feeling of insecurity arises more from worries about daily life than
                                       from the dread of a cataclysmic world event […] most people instinctively understand
                                       what security means. It means safety from the constant threats of hunger, disease,
                                       crime and repression. It also means protection from sudden and hurtful disruptions
                                       in the patterns of our daily life ([<a href="#R16">16</a>], p.&nbsp;3). The Human Development Report [<a href="#R16">16</a>] redefines the security-development nexus by placing individuals and communities
                                       at the center of both security and development. It states that human security has
                                       two main categories i.e. ‘‘freedom from fear’’ (e.g. threats from war, conflict and
                                       state-sponsored violence) and ‘‘freedom from want’’ (e.g. preventable diseases, economic
                                       hardship, poverty, developmental concerns) ([<a href="#R16">16</a>], p.&nbsp;24). Debates over this categorization reflect that ‘freedom from fear’ and ‘freedom
                                       from want’ are inter-related and provide a fundamental basis for human security. However,
                                       the gendered aspect of human security is still under-researched. Hoogensen and Gjørv
                                       (2005) describe the limitations of the human security debate, and state that gender
                                       approaches are relevant and can offer forward direction to operationalization of the
                                       concept. In contrast to conventional human security analysis, ‘‘gender analysis shows
                                       us that top-down articulations of security concepts—such as those from national governments
                                       or international organizations—often do not address the security needs of those ‘below’.
                                       In addition, relying on ‘existing mechanisms ‘has been a longstanding critique of
                                       the gender literature, as these mechanisms have so often overlooked gender violence
                                       (domestic and sexual) and/or violence against marginalized groups such as indigenous
                                       peoples within what are otherwise considered ‘secure’ states’’ ([<a href="#R17">17</a>], p.&nbsp;209). Including gender analysis in human security debates will raise questions
                                       regarding inequality, power distribution and structural violence. Many critical theory
                                       approaches are complementary to one another, while elucidating dominance and non-dominance
                                       based on race, ethnicity and class; however, the incorporation of gender makes theses
                                       disparities and inequalities more visible. Moreover, gender has been fundamentally
                                       decisive for both policy and academic analysis regarding war and peace. Notions of
                                       individual-oriented security were discussed in particular during the period of the
                                       Enlightenment [<a href="#R1">1</a>, <a href="#R17">17</a>, <a href="#R18">18</a>, <a href="#R19">19</a>, <a href="#R20">20</a>]. Also, Wolfers [<a href="#R21">21</a>] poignantly noted that security prior to the world wars of the 20th century was associated
                                       particularly with welfare [<a href="#R17">17</a>]. Without gender analysis, a fundamental power relation is erased from reality [<a href="#R17">17</a>]. Keeping in mind the context of Pakistan, this paper will explore the nexus of gender-based
                                       violence and role of community policing and intervention of technology in understanding
                                       the state services and the gaps that exist in dealing with security provision to violence
                                       victims in communities. If we analyze the UNDP 1994 definition of human security through
                                       a gender lens, we may argue that it opens avenues for both men and women to be equally
                                       entitled to all types of securities [<a href="#R16">16</a>]. However, feminists extend the concept by including sustainable development, social
                                       justice, and the protection of human rights and capabilities as central aspects of
                                       human security [<a href="#R22">22</a>]. This broader concept of human security invites thoughts and critical analysis about
                                       how gender influences the handling of threats or violence, and who decides what experiences
                                       in conflict situations are important for policy and development initiatives. Knowing
                                       people’s perceptions about security and insecurity yields a very different understanding
                                       of the concept of human security [<a href="#R23">23</a>]. Human security when understood in context of Pakistan has helped to set a foundation
                                       for gaining further insight and understanding of the notions of power inequalities,
                                       gendered vulnerabilities in accessing the service provision particularly in dealing
                                       with gender based violence victims, which is the main subject of this paper.

                                       be used interchangeably because during conflict the majority of women face gender-based
                                       violence just because they were ‘‘women or feminine’’ [<a href="#R24">24</a>]. Domestic violence is the most common type of insecurity women face in their daily

                                    <p id="d1e242">WHO and UN also describe gender-based violence as a basic human rights offence. The
                                       2017 WHO report on violence against women clearly mentioned that Every human being
                                       (men and women) has the innate right to his/her physical, sexual, emotional integrity
                                       and health [<a href="#R27">27</a>]. Similarly, The United Nations Charter of Human Rights (1945) grants equal rights
                                       to both men and women. The perpetuated violence can occur within the family, community
                                       and at the state level, cutting across class, ethnicity, religion, other social divisions,
                                       and factors of inequality [<a href="#R28">28</a>]. Sexual and gender-based violence represents an extreme form of discrimination and
                                       a serious human rights violation that may affect a number of human rights, including
                                       the right to life, liberty and security of the person, and the right to freedom from
                                       torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Acts of GBV
                                       threaten the health, dignity, security, and autonomy of victims but remain largely
                                       ignored and under-reported, particularly when they occur far from the public eye,
                                       which include domestic violence, sexual harassment, sexual violence and rape [<a href="#R3">3</a>]. A gender perspective on violence is not all about violence on women, but it provides
                                       new context, where the focus is shifted from women as victims of violence to gender
                                       and the unequal power relationships which are created by stereotypes. A gender perspective
                                       on violence against women addresses the similarities and differences in the violence
                                       experienced by women and men in relation to vulnerabilities, violations, and consequences
                                       [<a href="#R29">29</a>]. Focus on gender-based violence against women is not to imply that women are never
                                       violent against men but although the rates and forms of violence, including intimate
                                       partner violence, vary widely across cultures are affecting women more [<a href="#R30">30</a>]. The term violence is multidimensional and is operational at different levels in
                                       the social and state apparatus. The manifestation of violence ranges from visible
                                       to invisible, from structural, political to cultural and symbolic [<a href="#R31">31</a>, <a href="#R32">32</a>]. As discussed earlier, violence is a gendered phenomenon as it is widely contested
                                       in its placement in public and private sphere. Hume (2007, 2008, 2009) suggests understanding
                                       the phenomenon of violence from a gendered perspective, as it will defy the homogeneous
                                       discourse on violence and allow us to understand the invisible structural violence
                                       operational at all levels [<a href="#R33">33</a>, <a href="#R34">34</a>, <a href="#R35">35</a>]. Gendered accounts of violence will thus both allow an understanding of violence
                                       at domestic level, as well as other social and cultural forms of violence against
                                       women [<a href="#R33">33</a>, <a href="#R35">35</a>, <a href="#R36">36</a>].

                                    <p id="d1e288">As we saw in the introduction, the police’s role in GBV cases needs to be improved
                                       and strengthened. One of the challenges for the police in addressing GBV is the lack
                                       of trust between police and the public. Trust and confidence in policing has always
                                       been investigated as one of the broader social queries in police-public relations.
                                       Public trust in police arises as a result of people’s expectations towards police.
                                       Also, the public is the end user of services and expects the police to provide security
                                       and support specifically when their safety is at stake [<a href="#R37">37</a>]. Thus, their trust is an indicator of the belief they have in the ability of police
                                       to provide security and ensure their protection in any given situation [<a href="#R38">38</a>]. According to Shinar and Stiebel [<a href="#R39">39</a>] trust in any institution emerges from the public’s observations made in relation
                                       to the effectiveness, responsiveness and preparedness of the institution [<a href="#R40">40</a>]. Public trust in police can play a vital role in enhancing police effectiveness
                                       and legitimacy of police actions [<a href="#R41">41</a>]. Trust is linked to the capacity of state police to provide basic citizen security
                                       [<a href="#R42">42</a>]. Public cooperation with police increases when they view police as trustworthy.
                                       The existence and extent of trust depends upon a number of factors both within and
                                       outside police control. A deficit of trust in police is all too common in deeply divided,
                                       post conflict and post authoritarian societie [<a href="#R43">43</a>, <a href="#R44">44</a>]. The historical role of police, degree of effectiveness and range of practices in
                                       public dealing play a part in explaining the trust deficit. Strained police-public
                                       relations undermine the crucial role of police in ensuring safety and protecting human
                                       rights [<a href="#R42">42</a>]. Winning over peoples’ trust and respect is not an easy task; it requires the police
                                       to uphold the highest level of honesty, integrity and professionalism to earn the
                                       goodwill of the people. Moreover, it is important that police must focus upon establishing
                                       positive interactions with the public, respond to the needs of the citizenry with
                                       efficacy, adapt and abide by a strong ethical code, and bring in transparency and
                                       accountability to their functions [<a href="#R45">45</a>].
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e321">Community-based policing has myriad definitions and approaches which makes it an ambiguous
                                       concept [<a href="#R46">46</a>]. Some of the common aspects that are discussed in literature are ‘‘police-community
                                       partnerships, a problem-solving approach, and organizational decentralization’’ ([<a href="#R47">47</a>], p.&nbsp;5). It has been recognized widely that policing is not only a matter of crime-fighting
                                       and surveillance the concepts of human security and sovereignty are of prime importance
                                       in policing [<a href="#R46">46</a>, <a href="#R48">48</a>]. Community-based policing focuses on the development of a collaborative partnership
                                       between community and the police to proactively address the root-causes of insecurities
                                       in the society. As community-based policing is a proactive rather than a reactive
                                       approach in nature, citizens’ involvement is crucial in both the identification of
                                       and solutions to problems. As a result of implementing community-based policing, both
                                       the police and the community share enhanced responsibility to curb crime. Police-public
                                       partnership, thus formed, results in mutual benefit for both the stakeholders. The
                                       concept has gained momentum over traditional policing models not only due to the fact
                                       that police in the world today are increasingly underequipped and under resourced
                                       to deal with the growing and enhanced complexity of crimes, but also because of the
                                       numerous advantages that citizen support and partnership brings to the society at
                                       large. To develop community partnerships, the police must build positive relations
                                       with the community, involve the community in the quest for better crime control and
                                       prevention and pool their resources with those of the community to address the community’s
                                       most urgent concerns. The partnership of community has become indispensable for both
                                       the police and the public. The collaborative relationship formed between police and
                                       public results in many advantages, including enhanced public confidence in police
                                       department, reduction in societal violence, police-public partnership, peaceful co-existence
                                       in neighborhoods, saving in police time from unnecessary arrests and trials, speedy
                                       dispute resolution, and diminished need for use of physical force by the police [<a href="#R49">49</a>, <a href="#R50">50</a>]. In the context of Pakistan, there have been many attempts to improve community-police
                                       relations to enhance the trust of the people, however, these attempts need a more
                                       comprehensive approach including more women in the police that can relate to women’s
                                       insecurities, and more well trained women and men to handle cases related to gender
                                       based violence.

                                    <p id="d1e358">In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, various ICT initiatives have been launched by KP police to
                                       help communities to more easily access police. In September 2015, the KP Police established
                                       a Police School of Information Technology. The public can now lodge an online First
                                       Information Report (FIR) and register complaints. The Victim Services Toll Free Numbers
                                       are established that help victims who need quick service or are not in a position
                                       to visit a Police Station to file a complaint. Using the toll-free number, a victim
                                       can complain about a police officer and police stations. The service aims at both
                                       reducing police response time and providing the Provincial Police Office with a monitoring

                                       and mobile phone access in rural areas, high levels of illiteracy, particularly for
                                       women to name a few. In terms of reporting sensitive issues such as GBV, these technologies
                                       in themselves are not sufficient. It is important in contexts such as KP where there
                                       is a lack of trust in the police to address GBV in ways that ensure the safety of

                                       meetings, social and cultural events where people communicate and build trusting relations
                                       are important to link to the development of more digital ICT systems. In this study

                                 civil society organizations, police, Health Department staff, Social Welfare Department
                                 staff, and staff of <i>Darul Aman</i> (women’s shelters). The first author then arranged detailed discussions with each
                                 stakeholder. The discussion took place in Urdu, the national language of Pakistan
                                 , in which the first author and the respondents are fluent. Interviews were conducted
                                 with three staff from a women’s NGO (one women and two men), two local male activists,
                                 one female lawyer, one district officer from social welfare department (male), the
                                 head of the emergency department from Ayub Medical Complex (male), one woman police
                                 from Shinkiari (city in Mansehra district) and three women police from main Mansehra
                                 city, the male Station House Officer (SHO) from main Mansehra police station, and
                                 10 women in a women’s shelter. In addition, we also selected a rural community in
                                 Shinkiari, Mansehra District to interview ten local men and ten local women to understand
                                 their perspectives around GBV, the role of police and how ICT might improve the situation.
                                 For all of the interviews, a question guide was developed that focused on exploring
                                 issues of gender based violence and the effective role of ICT in enhancing the coordination
                                 among various stakeholders involved in mitigating the process of GBV. The discussions
                                 were open-ended, allowing the respondents to bring in issues that they themselves
                                 considered important. The interviews were then coded by theme and category, and analyzed
                                 to explore the various ways each stakeholder understood GBV and their role in addressing
                                 key issues. In addition to interviews we also consulted policy documents, and to better
                                 understand GBV issues in the area we also studied project reports of a civil society
                                 organizations working with GBV issues. In addition, police station in Shinkiari granted
                                 us access to the complaint register to see the nature of complaints.

                                    <p id="d1e380">Mansehra [<a href="#R56">56</a>] is a district in Hazara Division of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in Pakistan. Total
                                       area of district Mansehra is 4,579 Sq KM, however the population size is 1,556,460.
                                       The dominant language is Hindko. Mansehra district is the largest district of Hazara
                                       division, which is further divided into 5 tehsils [<a href="#R57">57</a>] and 174 Village Councils. Mansehra district has 13 police stations in total. We
                                       chose Mansehra after detailed meetings with an international civil society organization
                                       that was working on a community policing project with Khuwand e Kor, a local implementing
                                       partner organization. The project dealt with police and GBV, and was titled <b>‘‘An innovative model for strengthening community-based measures to curb violence
                                          against women and girls in Mansehra District, Pakistan’’</b>. Khuwand e Kor worked at grass root level by organizing daily radio talk show campaigns,
                                       supporting legal rights activists in the district, organizing civil rights and gender
                                       awareness campaigns for communities and arranging community-police sessions on various
                                       topics. Mansehra District was therefore suitable to explore the gaps identified in
                                       introduction.

                              <p id="d1e394">It is clear from our interviews and readings of policy documents that the relevant
                                 institutions in the government of Pakistan and civil society organizations are concerned
                                 with GBV and have taken several measures in addressing the GBV. However, there was
                                 a lack of concrete legal, institutional, and administrative initiatives by the government
                                 and other stakeholders. Our inquries uncovered some good work on the main causes and
                                 nature of GBV has been done mostly by civil society organizations. Most of this work,
                                 however, is scattered and has not led to a comprehensive approach and policy for handling
                                 GBV cases. Therefore, a need was felt to better understand GBV, the major actors related
                                 to GBV, the roles and responsibilities of GBV actors, the strength and weaknesses
                                 of GBV actors and the possibilities of developing ICTs for those actors for better
                                 coordination and response and prevention of GBV. The discussion below is divided into
                                 two sections. First, we will present the data from multiple dimensions to understand
                                 how GB is understood. We then move on to discuss the gaps in addressing GBV, and how
                                 ICT may play a role in improving the mechanisms through which women can seek security
                                 and protection.

                                    <p id="d1e399">To understand the context in which women live in Mansehra, it is important to understand
                                       the societal norms and values of the area. The differentiation of gender roles and
                                       social division are present in classical patriarchal manner, which provides the foundation
                                       of society in rural areas especially. Women are mainly confined to the household,

                                          <p id="d1e404">When we interviewed men and women in our study area about how they understand GBV,
                                             we came across very interesting insights.
                                          </p>
                                          <p id="d1e406">One of the respondents on inquiring about GBV said that <i>‘violence doesn’t only come from the husband but sometimes husband’s family is equally
                                                involved in inflicting the violence over women’</i>.
                                          </p>
                                          <p id="d1e411">Domestic violence involves wide range of factor i.e. in most cases other members of
                                             the family are also involved. Another respondent illustrated that her husband is in
                                             middle east and she stays with her in laws. For her it’s very tough to live with her
                                             in-laws in the absence of her husband because her husband always sides with his family
                                             and she faces emotional and psychological abuse continuously. Similarly, she reflected
                                             that <i>‘‘Domestic violence happens across economic classes and educational background. What
                                                matters the most is how men are brought up in the families’’</i>. Another woman said <i>‘‘I used to believe that domestic violence only existed in rural areas where people
                                                are less educated but few years back when I was working as a housekeeper I saw my
                                                master beating his wife brutally, though she was a well-educated and working woman.
                                                Only then I realized domestic violence is something every woman faces’’</i>.
                                          </p>
                                          <p id="d1e419">We also conducted focus group discussions of women belonging to lower socio-economic
                                             strata since majority of the population was poor in our study area. According to the
                                             participants of the focus groups the prevalence of violence is comparatively more
                                             in poor class than in middle class households. Poverty and economics play one of the
                                             major roles in boosting a toxic masculinity. If a man cannot fulfill the needs of
                                             the family, he ultimately takes out his frustration on the women in the family. One
                                             of the respondent narrated, <i>‘‘It depends on the mood of my man, if he is stressed he behaves rudely or sometimes
                                                beats me’’</i>. This is similar to the results of a study on attitudes to wife-beating in Cambodia,
                                             which suggests that women who are socio-economically dependent on their partners are
                                             more tolerant of partner abuse and are at greater risk of experiencing it. As illustrated
                                             by one women, <i>‘‘We are dependent upon them for even our basic needs and being the disadvantaged
                                                spouse we have to bear domestic violence’’</i>.
                                          </p>
                                          <p id="d1e427">It is equally important to understand how men understand domestic violence since they
                                             are one of the main actors in the phenomenon. When we interviewed men and asked how
                                             they understand and define domestic violence, they were reluctant to talk about it.
                                             According to them domestic violence is a private matter and shouldn’t be discussed
                                             in public and outside the house. Being part of a patriarchal society men hold access
                                             and exercise their will as they have structural power over women. In such circumstances
                                             even if the man is poor or unemployed he still dominates in all relationships. One
                                             of the respondents narrated that <i>‘‘Women should be granted rights but I as a man would never allow women in my family
                                                to practice these rights in a way they challenge the gender roles’’</i>. Most of male respondents were familiar with the term violence, and two of them believed
                                             that domestic violence had increased as the exposure of women has increased. According
                                             to them the information and access to internet and television should be controlled
                                             if this issue needs to be controlled. Another male respondent said that, <i>‘‘Men in rural areas think that there is no benefit to educate daughters, because
                                                eventually they will wash dishes after marriage’’</i>. Men strongly believe that the actual duty of women is to work inside the home not
                                             outside. Another respondent said that <i>‘‘It’s my responsibility to earn for my family not my wife’s. Her sole responsibility
                                                is to look after me and my children and if she fails to do so then beating her is
                                                not violence because I have full rights on her’’</i>. In Pakistan women have strict limitations regarding their thinking and movements.
                                             Another respondent narrated <i>‘‘Women in our culture are not allowed to keep aside our norms and values and start
                                                opposing her husband. Because if she has no respect for her family honor then her
                                                husband has the rightful right to beat, scold or stop her if required’’</i>. Whatever she does, she will keep the perceptions of her close male relatives such
                                             as brother, husbands and fathers in view [<a href="#R58">58</a>].
                                          </p>
                                          <p id="d1e444">Men irrespective of their economic class believed that domestic violence can either
                                             be acceptable and unacceptable based upon the situation. One respondent said that
                                             <i>‘‘Domestic violence is not always the result of mal behavior of men, sometimes it
                                                can be the women because if she instigates a man to beat her than a man is left with
                                                no choice. Men don’t get into violent behavior without any valid reason’’</i>.
                                          </p>
                                          <p id="d1e449">They all believed that giving education to women is important but that education should
                                             not challenge the gender roles ascribed by the society. A respondent illustrated <i>‘‘We are not against education. As you have seen we send our girls to school and my
                                                own daughter is doing her bachelors but this does not mean that in the future if my
                                                daughter on the basis of her education challenge my authority I will let her do it’’</i>.
                                          </p>
                                          <p id="d1e454">Another man said that <i>‘‘Since centuries it’s been the woman who is responsible for making and breaking the
                                                house because if she is not ready to compromise then the wheel of marriage can’t be
                                                run effectively. The environment of the house gets effected when she gets offended
                                                over petty things. For instance, once me and my wife had a fight and I accidentally
                                                pushed her. The result was she got a bruise and she went and complained to my in-laws.
                                                The result was they came in the evening demanding an apology from me. Before all this
                                                happened I was feeling guilty but after she involved other people in our private affair
                                                then she was the one to be blamed. Due to this my house environment was disturbed’’</i>.

                                          <p id="d1e459">However, we met two men in the same community who were local activists and were attached
                                             to KK (khuwand-e-kor, a local organization) in project dealing with GBV. Both of these
                                             men were journalists by profession and were fulfilling their responsibility as a responsible
                                             citizen by doing social work in their respective communities. When we asked them why
                                             they think GBV is prevalent in the society, they explained it through economic lens
                                             arguing that in poverty brings innumerable evils with it and violence is one of them.
                                             If the rural communities are given full opportunities to establish their lives according
                                             to decent standards, this menace can be controlled. However, they couldn’t see the
                                             power imbalance and patriarchy as a root cause of GBV. It illustrated that it need
                                             long term awareness sessions of the communities where they need to learn that how
                                             societies, rituals and customs are inherently gendered and patriarchal in nature.
                                             And how the power hierarchies need to be renegotiated.
                                          </p>
                                          <p id="d1e461">Most of the men we spoke to thought that men are actively involved in domestic violence
                                             but they believed women provoke them to do violence. In a patriarchal society, the
                                             role of men is well established. To move towards a socially and gender equitable society
                                             male engagement at all levels is important. In most cases men are agents of change
                                             or the gatekeepers and share equal responsibility towards gender equality. Patterns
                                             of gender inequality are borne out of stereotypical norms of masculinity and men’s
                                             gender identities [<a href="#R59">59</a>]. Without the involvement of men in the process of understanding the determinants
                                             of domestic violence against women, it is difficult to meaningfully improve the lives
                                             of women to promote sexual and reproductive rights as well as to identify measures
                                             involving men to reduce domestic violence against women [<a href="#R59">59</a>]. The above discussion indicates that men mainly believe that domestic violence is
                                             a private affair and beating a wife for not obeying her husband is normal. Furthermore,
                                             many men believed that although they are educating their girls, that does not ensure
                                             that education can make her strong enough to eradicate domestic violence. Traditional
                                             norms and values also play their role in it.

                                    <p id="d1e472">Throughout the country Islam is seen and followed with great respect but Islamic notions
                                       are stronger in rural area of Pakistan than urban areas. Islam is the driving narrative
                                       of different matters and in the case of domestic violence Islamic notions have a great
                                       deal to offer. Misinterpretation of different Islamic practices are quite common in
                                       rural areas. Islam is often used as a shield to defend different people’s narratives,
                                       for example if a man beats his wife he comes up with the argument that Allah has made
                                       us responsible for you therefore he has the ownership rights over women. A respondent
                                       narrated that <i>‘‘When my father used to beat my mother and my grandmother protested, my father justified
                                          the beating by saying that he is my mother’s Majazi Khuda [<a href="#R60">60</a>] and that disobeying or going against him is equaling to going against Allah</i>’’. Mostly culture allows selective and ‘‘justified’’ physical punishment of a ‘‘deviant’’
                                       wife [<a href="#R61">61</a>]; similarly, many scholars describe wives as ‘‘habitually’’ suffering violence in
                                       the name of religion [<a href="#R62">62</a>, <a href="#R63">63</a>]. Women believed that how they were raised played an important role because tolerating
                                       violence was one of the key characteristics they are preached. Most of the men and
                                       women agreed that domestic violence is bad in all forms from minor to major and that
                                       women prior to education need to have basic knowledge about their rights. One of the
                                       lady health workers we interviewed narrated an incident where, <i>‘‘A woman in the village filed a case against her husband in local police station.
                                          After launching the complaint, the woman faced irresistible resistance from her in-laws
                                          and her own parents. Eventually the whole matter was taken to the Jirga where she
                                          apologized to her husband for not respecting the privacy. The husband took her back
                                          in her house but till this date she gets beaten up by her husband regularly’’</i>. She went on saying, <i>‘‘the whole village knows about her suffering but no one can do anything about it.
                                          Had she been taken into protection by the police, her suffering might have ended’’</i>.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e496">Many women stated that all the matters in their lives are adopted according Islamic
                                       teachings. One of the woman said that, <i>‘‘A husband can beat his wife because our religion permits him to do so’’</i>. When asked to quote the reference she was clueless of whether this is narrated in
                                       Quran or Hadith [<a href="#R64">64</a>]. She further explained that, <i>‘‘We should not argue on matters of religion’’</i>. When asked to explain the context she said that when a woman disobeys her husband,
                                       he is rightful to beat his wife. In addition, going to her parents’ home without asking
                                       permission, not fulfilling husband’s needs, and not looking after her home and kids,
                                       were enough reasons to get beaten. It indicates that Muslim women may have internalized
                                       one reading of Islam, which justifies wife beating for disloyalty or disobedience
                                       and the view that men’s violence in marriage is a legitimate expression of patriarchal
                                       authority [<a href="#R65">65</a>]. Another male respondent said <i>‘‘Our religion permits us to beat our wife for her benefit because women don’t have
                                          an insight of the outer world like we do. Therefore, stopping them by the use of force
                                          is not domestic violence’’</i>. Another male said that <i>‘‘Many of my relatives believe that when a wife is beaten the women is the one to
                                          be blamed because domestic violence occurs when a woman is being disobedient. Prior
                                          to the fact that disobeying their husbands is equaling to disobeying their Lord’’</i>.

                                             we interviewed staff from KK to understand their work and experience working with
                                             GBV in Mansehra District. KK has successfully run a project titled <i>‘‘An innovative model for strengthening community-based measures to curb violence
                                                against women and girls in Mansehra District, Pakistan’’</i> for 10 years. As mentioned earlier, Mansehra District is one of the largest and under
                                             privileged districts in Hazara division. Through KK’s interventions 396 GBV cases
                                             were facilitated. KK arranged nearly 1000 community meetings to raise awareness among
                                             men and women about women’s issues and provided legal assistance to those who needed
                                             it. In our research we explored that how KK has made community interventions, what
                                             strategies they designed and what challenges they faced. We visited Shinkiari Police
                                             station, since Shinkiari police station is one of the model police station that is
                                             set up with the help of KK. It is in a peripheral area and we examined how a police
                                             station located at a peripheral rural area functions, operates and deals with cases
                                             of GBV. We found that the police stations in small towns were very different in their
                                             appearance as compared to the model police stations in district headquarters. Only
                                             one woman police was on duty for the whole union council which is seriously inadequate
                                             if one looks at the areas size and population. Secondly, the women’s help desk and
                                             the office where the women’s complaint center was set up were in miserable condition.
                                             All the authority and the facilities were with the male SHO inside the building.

                                             is not very promising. The staff in KK worked extensively to establish groups and
                                             committees of local men and women. The nominated committee members by the NGO based
                                             on their active role in the community were regularly called for meetings where they
                                             were assigned their respective roles and responsibilities. These selected men and
                                             women were given different ranks within committees like president, vice presidents,
                                             deputy. The men and women who were selected were active in the community like teachers,
                                             lawyers, lady health workers, and religious leaders. Special operating procedures
                                             were designed for the activities of community groups /committees. Proper bi-monthly
                                             meetings were conducted by these community groups where members would identify the
                                             issue, discuss the strategy to address the issue and then lobby with relevant actors
                                             for sustainable solutions. All the activities and meetings were properly documented
                                             and minutes of the meeting were mandatory to share with KK office in Mansehra city.

                                             started working in 2010 and they ran the project very successfully till 2013. KK named
                                             all the village groups and committees as <i>‘‘KK area co-ordination Committee’’</i>. When the project ended in 2013, KK handed over the project to the district government.
                                             District Government renamed the local groups/committees as <i>‘‘Aman committee’’</i> and these committees were allocated space in the Deputy Commissioner’s office. The
                                             government operated it only for six months, and after that the committee disintegrated
                                             because there were many issues that were emerging within the community and without
                                             proper supervision (done previously by KK), the whole mechanism of involvement of
                                             local communities perished. In 2015 KK again started the project with the help of
                                             an international NGO. This time KK extended its services to police stations. KK has
                                             been involved extensively in police trainings. These trainings were initially arranged
                                             in KK offices, however, strong links have been established in police training units
                                             in Peshawar. Together with the police department they established 3 Model Police <i>Thana</i> (stations) in Mansehra i.e. one in main city, one in Shinkiari and one in Khaki.
                                             The international NGO signed an MOU with police department, and they hired six women
                                             police constables on the project payroll. This was reduced to three due to shortage
                                             of funds from the international NGO. Hiring of women police constables was a very
                                             flawed process that involved corruption and incompetency. For example, one of the
                                             female Senior Superintendents of Police (SSPs) hired the sister of her servant. She
                                             was on the international NGO’s payroll and was working as a nanny for her boss’ children
                                             for six months. There have been other serious issues as well, for example, lower staff
                                             get transferred every three months. This frequent transfers created impediments in
                                             the process /mechanism established by KK. Despite these challenges, KK worked closely
                                             with the police as an important stakeholder.

                                          <p id="d1e541">One question we posed to the KK staff was whether this grass root intervention and
                                             establishment of community mechanism helped in preventing gender-based violence. As
                                             a response one respondent narrated a story, <i>‘‘One of the key stakeholders in this process were religious leaders, since religion
                                                has a major role in the lives of people living in rural areas. The religious leaders
                                                and scholars have access to the grass-roots of society. Thus, religious scholars are
                                                involved in the projects from the very beginning. Once the KK team wanted to intervene
                                                in one of the tough villages through religious leaders. The team head, who was a woman,
                                                started visiting the Maulana [religious leader] who was very well known in the area.
                                                She wanted his support in creating awareness regarding domestic violence. She visited
                                                Maulana innumerable times until he refused to meet her. After a few days Maulana nevertheless
                                                called her and had a meeting with her. He explained that t he needed some time to
                                                internalize what the KK team wanted to preach through him. He told the team head that
                                                he had seen members of his extended family committing violence against women. He felt
                                                that he first had to start by sensitizing them, and then he could do so to others
                                                in the village’’</i>. Our respondent told us that there are many examples where community has started
                                             working closely with the KK. However, community participation and establishment of
                                             trust is a long and tedious process and be cannot achieved in a day. It requires long
                                             term planning and resources.

                                          <p id="d1e546">When asked about how reported cases of violence are handled in <i>thanas</i> [<a href="#R67">67</a>], our respondent said that generally <i>thanas</i> are not well-trained in handling the victims in a sensitive way. When a victim comes
                                             to a <i>thanas</i> battered and wounded, he or she is sent to the district hospital for a medical checkup,
                                             because without a firsthand medical report the FIR cannot be launched. Ideally a women
                                             police constable accompanies the victim to the hospital. However, if female staff
                                             is not present then victim has to do it on her own. Similarly, if transport is not
                                             available in the <i>thanas</i>, then it is hired from outside, compromising the victim’s identity. The victim then
                                             gets the report and comes back to the police station and launches the FIR. If the
                                             condition of the victim is at that point serious, then the female constable (if available),
                                             gets the victim admitted to the hospital. The police on duty in hospital (every hospital
                                             has a small police office in case of emergency) to keep an eye on the patient. If
                                             nobody is available at the hospital, then victim is left unattended and the female
                                             constable returns to the <i>thanas</i> to do the paperwork. In most of the cases the police themselves arrange a meeting
                                             with the husband and reconcile the couple as if it was a dispute. In most cases the
                                             argument put across is that its normal for a husband to beat the wife. There is a
                                             serious issue in considering violence a dispute. Because in police stations and in
                                             DRCs [<a href="#R68">68</a>] all the cases that are registered for GBV are considered and executed as disputes
                                             between the couple. And the emphasis has always remained on reconciliation. However,
                                             GBV is still struggling to be recognized as crime.

                                          <p id="d1e573">To understand the role of the Health Department in facilitating the GBV survivors
                                             to get a medical and legal help, interviews were conducted from the Head of Emergency
                                             Department Ayub Medical Complex and his team. He explained that the Government of
                                             Pakistan has developed a mechanism for GBV survivors to get legal and medical help.
                                             For example, the victim has to go to a government hospital to get a medico-legal report
                                             for filing an FIR in the police station. Without this report the complaint cannot
                                             be filed. The severe cases of GBV who come directly to medical hospitals for assistance
                                             are diverted by the doctors to the police guard established within the hospital. There
                                             the case is registered and only then doctors can give medical aid. GBV cases are not
                                             entertained by the medical staff of any government or private hospitals, or Basic
                                             Health Units (BHUs) without being reported to police. Ayub Medical Complex, which
                                             is biggest teaching hospital of Hazara Division, sees a huge number of GBV cases annually.
                                             Most of the cases that are treated in emergency department are of burns and poison.
                                             Inside the hospital there is a well-established police unit with regular police officers
                                             on duty 24/7. Currently, district government has increased the number of police officers
                                             placed in the hospital. There are six to eight female police officers who are present
                                             in the hospital in morning and evening shift along with male police. However, the
                                             situation becomes bleak as we move towards the BHUs, smaller hospitals and towards
                                             deprived districts where the health department and police department are relatively
                                             weak as compared to Abbottabad [<a href="#R69">69</a>]. There the challenges of safety and security of medical staff and the victim increases.
                                             Our interviewee told us that in smaller hospitals doctors are threatened by the victims’
                                             families to not report the cases. There have been several incidents where doctors
                                             were kept hostages. Even in Ayub Medical Complex doctors on duty in Emergency are
                                             not safe. The Medical Officer on duty said, ’<i>‘‘The Government, while making policies for safety and security of GBV victims, should
                                                consider the security of the doctors who treat them because doctors are totally neglected
                                                in the process… How can we provide best services when we don’t feel safe and secure’’</i>. In addition, we have learnt from our interview with one of the NGO staff who works
                                             with police and GBV survivors that the victims who go to police station directly in
                                             remote areas for filing the complaint against violence are mostly sent to hospitals
                                             or BHUs for medico legal report alone, mostly due to unavailability of female staff
                                             or unavailability of other resources like transport. This represents a is high safety
                                             risk safety for victims.

                                          <p id="d1e581">We see that there are indeed mechanisms in place to assist GBV survivors: the Emergency
                                             Department of the hospitals are functional 24/7 every day of the year for treating
                                             all the emergency cases including GBV victims. Hospital administration together with
                                             police department have established police guards within hospitals to report the GBV
                                             cases instantly. The doctors on duty always produce honest medico-legal document upon
                                             examination. There are very thin chances that any doctor would produce fake certificate
                                             because this document is a legal document and can be challenged in the court. However,
                                             a formal documentation of the SOPs of the doctors working in emergency unit and with
                                             GBV survivors is not available, and may not even exist. The safety and security of
                                             the victims and the doctors and nurses on duty is not ensured either.

                                          <p id="d1e586">The Social Welfare Department has the core responsibility of providing shelter to
                                             women who are victims of abuse and violence. The Government of Pakistan gives custody
                                             of these women to the department with the permission of a magistrate. The department
                                             then send these women to crisis centers and takes responsibility for their security
                                             during transport while pursuing their cases in courts. Once the women are handed to
                                             the department, their safety, shelter and food is the responsibility of the department.
                                             In addition, the department also facilitate the women who are fighting legal battles
                                             with their abusers. <i>Dar-ul-Aman</i>, or shelter homes, work directly under this department. The women who need instant
                                             shelter and security are directly sent to <i>Dar ul Aman</i>. These women live within the prescribed boundary, and are not allowed to leave the

                                             although they do give interested women vocational training. The legal help that is
                                             given is also very slow and questionable since the social welfare department is not
                                             dealing with women only; working with charity and special children are also on their
                                             mandate. This affects the quality of attention needed to deal with GBV issue. There
                                             are no IT facilities at the department to help in their work. The district management
                                             officer acknowledged the importance of IT in general, but he was unable to comprehend
                                             how they might effectively use it in managing their system better. According to him
                                             the resources given to department are very limited for optimal functionality, and
                                             under such pressing conditions the department cannot afford to have an ICT facility.
                                             In addition, he said that the department is currently working on women, Islamic charity
                                             and needs of special children at the same time. It is difficult for the staff to comprehend
                                             and foresee how ICT might contribute to their work as long as their resources are
                                             so stretched.

                                             who had no one else to care for them. The <i>Dar-ul-Aman</i> is overcrowded and very ill managed. This shows the non-seriousness of the government
                                             towards the issue, despite political rhetoric of attention to GBV issues. Also, women
                                             are not provided with any psychological support neither given any life management
                                             skills other than vocational training. There is no separate unit for women with children
                                             and it is highly likely that most of the women with children go back to the abusive
                                             relationship. Crisis centers are considered safe places where women feel secure, however
                                             that is not the case according to many women who have lived within them. <i>Dar-ul-Aman</i> was created with the purpose of catering to the needs of homeless women, however
                                             over time this purpose has changed. Now the government runs all <i>Dar-ul-Aman</i> with strict rules and regulations, which only allow women who have court cases in
                                             process to live here. <i>Dar-ul-Aman</i> is a sub-type of shelter home in Pakistan. Several of the females who come to these
                                             shelter homes are runaways trying to escape from their unpleasant lives. <i>Dar-ul-Aman</i> can also act as home for occupants who wish to get away from their family, for this
                                             purpose the <i>Dar-ul-Aman</i> can momentarily ask for a court hearing. The danger to these women is often from
                                             their own families which makes it many times harder for them to go home.

                                          <p id="d1e626">The institutional hierarchy of <i>Dar-ul-Aman</i> is as stated by the Warden is that the residents report issues to the Warden ( the
                                             highest rank in the shelter), the Warden further reports to the police Superintendent.
                                             The police Superintendent reports to the District Police Officer, whom reports to
                                             the Director. The director reports to the Secretariat, while the Secretariat reports
                                             to the Chief Secretariat, who then reports to the Minister. If the issue is of a minor
                                             nature the superintendent tries to solve it internally and when in need of external
                                             aid or assistance a board of director’s meeting is called which works in an advisory
                                             position and can bring in donors. Furthermore, the residents can also report to the
                                             Superintendent directly by by-passing the warden if she feels the need.

                                             services. However, the educational services offered are only of a religious nature.
                                             Such institutions do not offer any modern, formal education, even though it is within
                                             its mandate. Similarly, the vocational services offered are the bare minimum with
                                             staff complaining that the equipment is old and faulty. Health services are offered
                                             extensively however, and if a patient wishes to go to a hospital an official court
                                             order must be approved. The Warden explained, <i>‘‘This is a security issue—even if a girl is ill we are not allowed to take her to
                                                a hospital. I first have to call a DPO. If we have his permission, then he will send
                                                police or some other security to escort us to the hospital.’’</i> The institutions have a nurse present full time. Several guards are also on duty
                                             at all hours of the day to ensure the safety of the inmates.

                                             are supposed to provide proper formal education but don’t. The staff are perpetually
                                             overworked with some having served 72 hour shifts. Similarly, the staff employed are

                                             violence. As discussed earlier, the government has set up special women’s desks for
                                             helping women complainants to launch their complaints smoothly, however, there are
                                             lots of administrative and social challenges that are faced not only by the women
                                             police but also the complainants. While interviewing women police we found that women
                                             police themselves don’t feel secure and face significant problems, one of which is
                                             long working hours. Women officers usually have to stay late at work, and this is
                                             difficult, as they are responsible for not only their official duties but house management
                                             as well.

                                             During the data collection, most of the women police complained about this issue.
                                             They were of the view that instead of being on duty 24/7, specific duty hours should
                                             be allocated so that they can manage their duty hours properly. The initial purpose
                                             of establishing women police stations was to provide relief and support to the women
                                             who approach police with their problems and are unable to share them with the male
                                             police. In the beginning, the women police were allowed to register the complaint/FIR
                                             and proceed the action according to the nature of issue brought up. But unfortunately,
                                             just after 3-4 years of their establishment, they were being stopped from performing
                                             their main function; to listen the problems of women that they feel hesitant to share

                                             they face in daily routines clarified that they themselves are facing multiple challenges
                                             in their daily work routines. In such a challenging work environment, it becomes rather
                                             difficult to ensure security of the victims. Therefore, we know from our research
                                             that police have been playing a very passive role in tackling issues related to gender-based
                                             violence. Moreover, the police have the mandate to take up cases of gender-based violence,
                                             but are not well trained and equipped. As reported by the woman police officer above,
                                             they council the women to solve their issues without involving police in it. Women
                                             mostly do not go to police stations for many reasons, which include; difficult procedures
                                             and the public environment of a police station, unapproachable attitudes of officers,
                                             lack of interest by the police in taking up cases of violence and especially domestic
                                             violence, and lastly, lack of trust that the police will implement the law. By law
                                             police are not allowed to arrest or hold a female victim overnight at a police station
                                             without a civil court judge’s consent. The law requires a victim to complain directly
                                             to a session’s court, which is considered a trial court for heinous offenses. After
                                             recording the victim’s statement, the session’s court judge officially lodges a complaint,
                                             after which police may then make arrests. NGOs reported the procedure created barriers
                                             for rape victims and domestic violence victims who could not afford to travel to or
                                             access the courts. NGOs reported that rape and domestic violence was a severely underreported
                                             crime. Adding fuel to the existing problem is the sensitivity of the matter as most
                                             of the victims (women) are reluctant to talk openly about this issue. This may be
                                             because in the cultural context this matter is considered exclusively a private or
                                             family issue, and as we saw in the interviews with men, that women are often blamed;
                                             and it is believed as well that openly admitting the existence of such an issue would
                                             further deteriorate the situation resulting in divorce or honor killing [<a href="#R70">70</a>].

                                             mentioned in DFAT, 2019, overall implementation of gender-based legislation lags,
                                             and the HRCP reported little substantive progress in 2017 on the rights of women and

                                             continue to escalate illustrates yet again the massive challenges to implementing
                                             the law and changing deeply entrenched societal attitudes. The government did not

                                             ways to address GBV at all levels and by multiple actors in Pakistan.

                                       start to see some of the major gaps and challenges in how GBV is handled in Pakistan.
                                       These include low competence and awareness of GBV issues, lack of knowledge of women’s
                                       rights and protection legislation, poor capacity, coordination and collaboration between
                                       multiple stakeholders, lack of SOPs which involve multiple actors involved in GBV
                                       response and prevention. From our analysis, we see that clear mechanisms need to be
                                       chalked out that not only connect the relevant actors involved in dealing, preventing
                                       and mitigating GBV but also help clarifying their roles and responsibilities to avoid
                                       overlap and confusion. We also found that there is no official documentation of any
                                       mechanisms at any level related to GBV. No SOPs are formulated, and documentation
                                       maintained.

                                       individuals that are working in the system. Rather than developing a reporting application,
                                       which already is covered by hotlines and digital FIRs, a resource application would
                                       be more helpful in this complex setting. An application can be designed to assist
                                       and guide relevant actors but also act as a resource to link to existing applicationss,
                                       helplines, and relevant training material on GBV. Most of the existing reporting apps
                                       are owned by police and police departments are vigilantly working with people to spread
                                       awareness about their usage and the services they are providing. However, there is
                                       a dire need that provincial and district government launches such well-coordinated
                                       and well-informed system, because what we learnt in our research is that lack of political
                                       will creates irreconcilable impediments in mechanisms. For instance, the main issue
                                       Khuwand e kor faced at district level is lack of resources and political will to deal
                                       with GBV cases. Community members who are part of district level committees could
                                       not manage to stay intact without any economic benefit. People used to travel long
                                       distance to join meetings could not spend 1000 RS from their pockets just to attend
                                       the meeting. Volunteerism becomes difficult when there is poverty and no support from
                                       the government. Therefore, the staff of KK was very supportive of the idea to develop
                                       a mechanism/app that can connect all the relevant stakeholders together. They also
                                       suggested to develop a resource app where all the relevant laws, ordinances, training
                                       materials, and phones numbers of relevant actors are combined. The app should be designed
                                       in a way that local government officer should be part of it because ownership from
                                       the government is very important. When it comes to the police, in rural and semi urban
                                       areas police are often used as a political pawn and sensitive cases like GBV often
                                       used as political tool to gain fame by local politicians. Either local politicians
                                       increase their vote banks by creating hype around these issues or totally suppress
                                       the cases to win support of local gentry. In the former case the confidentiality of
                                       the victims and the families is compromised which further complicates the situation.
                                       Therefore, according to local activists the launching of app might help in execution
                                       of these cases smoothly and confidentially. However, they emphasized that local district
                                       management, and NGOs working on the issue should be part of the app; police should
                                       not be the major actor because police are not capable enough to deal with such sensitive
                                       issues. When local activists were asked about the use of ICT in their own work, they
                                       were in full support of launching, for example, an application that could connect
                                       a common person with the authorities through local community organizations where they
                                       can instantly report the incident and also track the progress of the complaint. One
                                       of the local activists said that an application might save time and also help in escaping
                                       the political pressure that comes with such sensitive cases. Police officers also
                                       supported the introduction of ICT in the system that can help in mitigating and preventing
                                       GBV at grass root level. Some community members have also used technology to support
                                       their situation. There was, for example, a young woman who was educated till 10th
                                       standard, whose husband and in-laws were abusive. She endured the torture for some
                                       time, but since she had a smartphone and was well connected to her friends, she got
                                       to know about helpline services that were established to help women in abusive marriages.
                                       She launched a complaint against her husband and her husband was arrested. This incident
                                       created swirl in her village and the adjacent villages. When we asked about what happened
                                       after police arrested the husband, many said he was set free because the wife only
                                       wanted to threaten him.

                                    <p id="d1e746">There remain, however, many challenges in employing technology in a context where
                                       internet access, literacy and capacity is limited, and where people may not have experience
                                       using ICTs, or they have negative experiences. Also, the use of ICTs for GBV is something
                                       very new, and difficult for many people to grasp without being part of a reform process.
                                       As a part of our interviews, we asked both men and women in the communities to tell
                                       us if in their view ICT can help in solving and preventing the issue of GBV. It was
                                       initially very difficult for us to explain to women what we mean by ICT and how it
                                       might be relevant to GBV, however, once it was clear women came up with different
                                       opinions. Majority of the women we spoke to were uneducated and poor. They didn’t
                                       have access to smart phones, internet and had mobility issues. One of the women said,
                                       ‘‘If we are given good work and our economic condition becomes better, the violence
                                       will be controlled too. The app cannot help us as much a money can’’. Similarly, there
                                       was another woman who quoted the incident of Kohistan [<a href="#R72">72</a>] district where women were killed because they filmed themselves singing and clapping.
                                       She further said, ‘‘if we will use mobile for these purposes, we might face the same
                                       consequences.’’ The responses of women showed that they realized that GBV is an issue,
                                       however, they see its codependence on factors such as economics and cultural norms.
                                       At the same time, women’s agency in the area is so restricted that majority women
                                       don’t have access to mobile phones.

                                    <p id="d1e751">Women is Pakistan faces domestic violence menace whether she lives in urban area or
                                       rural. According to the Human Rights Watch, gender-based violence occurs as a cause
                                       and consequence of gender inequities. GBV includes a range of violent acts mostly
                                       committed by men against women within the context of the subordinate status of females
                                       in society. When men were asked about the importance and relevance of ICT in the prevention
                                       of GBV, they had mixed responses. Some of them couldn’t place the issue of GBV as
                                       a social issue as discussed above, and therefore did not see how ICT would be relevant.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e753">Similarly, the doctors were dismissive of the idea of using IT in handling of GBV
                                       cases. According to them most of the cases which are reported or come to hospital
                                       are from very low socio/economic strata. These people do not have access to internet
                                       and smart phone. IT might not help these victims. In addition, there are more important
                                       steps that are required to be taken than making ICT the part of the whole process.
                                       For example, the mechanism of handling GBVs at hospitals, police stations and other
                                       relevant departments is not documented properly. Similarly, the SOPs of the doctors
                                       in emergency and on call during such cases are not documented /formulated. Doctors
                                       themselves feel insure/insecure while handling such cases. There are many incidents
                                       where mob attacked doctors and threatened them. Doctors want some concrete safety
                                       measures for themselves. In addition, ICT and related information and capacity building
                                       is not recognized by the system at large and also by the professionals who are working
                                       within these systems. During the interviews mostly doctors couldn’t understand ICT.
                                       Courses on community and research methodology taken by doctors during their five-year
                                       MBBS study, for example, have no ICT component. In addition, the Welfare department
                                       and <i>Darul Amans</i> faced serious issues related to resource allocation, capacity building and presence
                                       of staff. There was a clear lack of understanding of the issues as the department
                                       was dealing with more than it can handle. Similarly, the condition of <i>Darul Amans</i> is no different. The staff there clearly indicated that they are not well trained
                                       and face innumerable financial and infrastructural challenges. In such pressing conditions,
                                       for them ICT is a luxury not a necessity. Lastly, the major stakeholder is the local
                                       police. In our research in Mansehra, we observed the Shinkiari police station was
                                       under-staffed and poorly equipped with facilities. There was one female constable
                                       in the police station and the workload and the area under the police station’s jurisdiction
                                       is large. However, despite of huge operational challenges police officers welcomed
                                       the idea because police is already using ICT in their systems and have seen the positive
                                       outcomes of the technology usage. However, dealing GBV cases is complicated and requires
                                       competence not only professionally but contextual and in terms of trust as well.

                              <p id="d1e764">In our research we identified the relevant actors involved in the GBV prevention mechanism
                                 and explored their roles and responsibilities, strengths and weaknesses, and the possibilities
                                 of using ICTs to improve coordination and response to Gender-Based Violence. From
                                 these interviews, we learned that the Pakistan police have limited competence in dealing
                                 with GBV issues, particularly at police station levels. They lack knowledge of laws,
                                 and of their role in dealing with victims and prevention. Both government institutions
                                 and civil society organizations are quite concerned with GBV and have taken a series
                                 of measures to address it. However, these measures tend to be more rhetorical than
                                 practical, and more concrete legal, institutional, administrative and practical mechanisms
                                 are required by all stakeholders. Nevertheless, some good work has been done on GBV,
                                 particularly by civil society organizations. For example, one NGO working with GBV
                                 for over 10 years developed a mechanism at the community level where local men and
                                 women formed village, union and tehsil level committees, and started intensive community
                                 awareness sessions on the issue. The NGO assisted these committees in creating linkages
                                 with police stations and lawyers, and they were often trained together to create a
                                 common understanding of the issues. However, there is a clear challenge to include
                                 district management into this mechanism, as the local government is often unwilling
                                 to adjust existing practices without the buy-in from higher levels. And while such
                                 NGO efforts are promising, most of the work is isolated, scattered and has not led
                                 to a comprehensive approach and policy for handling GBV cases. In addition to learning
                                 how GBV is understood, our research has explored new ways of thinking about the use
                                 of ICTs for GBV response and prevention. It is commonly believed that the main way
                                 that ICT can be used to support survivors is through the establishment of hotlines
                                 and reporting apps. Our research shows, however, that these are only accessible to
                                 small number of urban-based women. There remain many barriers for survivors to use
                                 such options—and they cannot necessarily ensure the safety of survivors in the response
                                 system. There is instead a need to combine ICTs with the strengthening of social networks
                                 where men and women can find safe spaces within the communities to go and share their
                                 issues, and be sure that they will receive the help and support needed to keep them
                                 safe. Those on the front lines dealing with GVB survivors, such as police, local health
                                 workers, teachers, and village activists, can develop these support networks, however
                                 they lack access to information and guidance on dealing with GBV issues in a coordinated
                                 manner. Even if they have participated in the few trainings available, follow-up is
                                 difficult. This is an area where ICTs could contribute as they could offer access
                                 to both information and guidance for each actor dealing with GVB, whether it is for
                                 response or prevention. But what is needed is real political will to invest in mechanisms
                                 that can truly make a difference.

                                          has the primary responsibility of reporting on the ratified international Conventions,
                                          as the coordinating body and to liaise with the provinces on human rights to ensure
                                          their coherence and alignment with international obli- gations. However, after the
                                          enactment of the Eighteenth Constitution (Amendment) Act, 2010, many responsibilities
                                          have been entrusted to provincial governments including implementation at the provincial
                                          level of international Human Rights treaties to which Pakistan is sig- natory. For
