                                 the national migration law of the selected Member States: Italy, Poland and Germany
                                 and to examine whether there exist guarantees of the right to migration security and
                                 guarantees for the realization of the principle of migration security priority at
                                 the level of national legislation. The second problem under investigation concerns
                                 the fact whether the changes introduced in the legislation recently ensure a higher
                                 level of migration security in comparison with the previous regulations. Finally,
                                 the analysis carried out in the current article is intended to demonstrate whether
                                 national law protects the rights of migrants and the receiving society in equal measure
                                 or whether certain fundamental rights which migrants are entitled to are at risk of
                                 being derogated due to the necessity of providing security to migration processes
                                 and the protection of the receiving society. The paper analyzes in detail the legislative
                                 initiatives and amendments introduced in migration and refugee law in Germany, Italy
                                 and Poland. What is more, the author gathers and analyzes the most representative
                                 national case law concerning the asylum and return migration.&nbsp;</span></div>

                              <p id="d1e75">The present article is an effect of the last stage of the research conducted within
                                 the framework of a broader project entitled ‘‘Security Management in European Asylum
                                 and Return Law and Policy with Regard to the Migration Crisis’’ [<a href="#R1">1</a>]. Under the existing research program, it was demonstrated that in the law and policies
                                 of the European Union there exists the so-called principle of migration security priority,
                                 ‘‘in accordance with which it is necessary to guarantee the highest level of security
                                 to all the actors of the migration process, that is to both migrants themselves, as
                                 well as the receiving society. This should occur both at the level of legislation
                                 and at the level of the application of the law’’ [<a href="#R2">2</a>]. Further, for the purposes of the conducted research, the so-called right to migration
                                 security has been defined as the third-generation law, guaranteed under the provisions
                                 of EU primary law ([<a href="#R3">3</a>], Art.&nbsp;67,77–79), which protects all the participants of migration processes—both
                                 the very migrants, as well as the receiving society.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e86">However, it seems that even a broader analysis of the union’s <i>acquis</i> (including the case law of the Court of Justice of the EU) is not sufficient to determine
                                 the level of the guaranteed migration security in the area of the European Union.
                                 It is the result of at least two factors. Firstly, the space of the so-called Area
                                 of Freedom, Security and Justice constitutes a competence shared between the EU and
                                 the Member States ([<a href="#R3">3</a>], Art.&nbsp;4(2)(j)). Therefore, the Member States may introduce legislation in the area
                                 of return law and for granting international protection ‘‘only to the extent that
                                 the Union has not done so’’ ([<a href="#R4">4</a>], p.&nbsp;117). Such a regulation of competence allows for a certain, albeit limited,
                                 freedom in the creation of unique migration policies—there might be some individual
                                 differences between different Member States in the regulations concerning the areas
                                 which are not unified within the framework of Union’s law. Apart from that, it should
                                 also be remembered that the existing acts of secondary law in the area of returns
                                 and granting of international protection are nevertheless directives which require
                                 implementation, leaving the Member States freedom in the choice of form and methods.
                                 The directives are binding with regard to the aims that they specify and the time
                                 frame for their implementation ([<a href="#R3">3</a>], Art.&nbsp;288).
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e100">Secondly, the full analysis of the processes of managing migration in the European
                                 Union is necessary to resort to the term Multi Level Governance (MLG), in accordance
                                 with which, the Member States do not play a dominant role in the creation of Union’s
                                 policies, but rather, the processes of managing the Union occur simultaneously at
                                 the national, supranational and subnational levels in a parallel way ([<a href="#R5">5</a>], p.&nbsp;39). As S. Prince observes, the MLG doctrine consists in a mode of governance
                                 of ‘‘interconnected arenas’’ in which local, regional, national and supranational
                                 levels of government depend upon each other’’ ([<a href="#R5">5</a>] p.&nbsp;40). In the same vein, the management of migration security concerns both the
                                 international and national levels, as well as to a large degree the regional level
                                 ([<a href="#R6">6</a>], p.&nbsp;6).
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e111">The migration crisis turned out to be a considerable challenge for Member States,
                                 which did not expect such a huge influx of migrants in 2015. In accordance with the
                                 data of the European Asylum Support Office, it is estimated that 1 392 155 applications
                                 for international protection were then submitted in the EU ([<a href="#R7">7</a>], p.&nbsp;5). As a result, Member States were forced to change the priorities of their
                                 migration policies in accordance with the political instruments adopted by the EU.
                                 Those instruments included, among others, the Communication from the European Commission
                                 ‘‘European Agenda on Migration’’ [<a href="#R8">8</a>]. Two types of narration emerged in the political discourse at that time: one that
                                 called for strengthening the need for solidarity-based actions among Member States
                                 with a view to effective migration management ([<a href="#R9">9</a>], pp.&nbsp;80–94), and another, a conservative narration, pointing out to potential threats
                                 related to increased migration movements (an example of transferring the latter into
                                 real actions was, among others, the reintroduction of controls at internal borders
                                 ([<a href="#R10">10</a>], p.&nbsp;39). Taking into account the fact that migration policy, in accordance with
                                 Art. 4 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, is a competence shared
                                 between the Union and the Member States, an analysis of the legislation on migration
                                 adopted at the national level, as well as the case law of national courts, will allow
                                 for an assessment as to which actions became a priority for the Member States.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e125">Taking into account the fact that migration policy, in accordance with Art. 4 of the

                                    <p id="d1e133">The right to migration security is guaranteed in the primary law of the EU, which
                                       has been demonstrated in the previous stage of the research [<a href="#R11">11</a>]. Therefore, if Member States are bound by the treaties, which is beyond doubt, consequently
                                       they are also obliged to realize the guarantees of the right to migration security
                                       at the level of the currently pursued migration policy and the existing legislation
                                       in this area.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e138">The aim of the article is to analyze the changes introduced recently (2018–2019) in
                                       the national migration law of the selected Member States: Italy, Poland and Germany
                                       and to examine whether there exist guarantees of the right to migration security and
                                       guarantees for the realization of the principle of migration security priority at
                                       the level of national legislation. The second problem under investigation concerns
                                       the fact whether the changes introduced in the legislation recently ensure a higher
                                       level of migration security in comparison with the previous regulations. Finally,
                                       the analysis carried out in the current article is intended to demonstrate whether
                                       national law protects the rights of migrants and the receiving society in equal measure
                                       or whether certain fundamental rights which migrants are entitled to are at risk of
                                       being derogated due to the necessity of providing security to migration processes
                                       and the protection of the receiving society.

                                    <p id="d1e143">In the course of the conducted analysis, what proved especially useful was reference
                                       to the model of an ideal system of national law, devised for the purpose of the current
                                       article, which would fully guarantee the realization of the migration security priority
                                       and the right to migration security.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e145">It is beyond doubt that the migration crisis is a phenomenon which results in the
                                       actions undertaken by the states with a view to safeguarding and protecting sovereignty,
                                       citizenship, national security and identity ([<a href="#R12">12</a>], p.&nbsp;347), which leads to the so-called securitization of migration ([<a href="#R12">12</a>] pp.&nbsp;352-353, [<a href="#R13">13</a>] p.&nbsp;21). As a consequence, migration law becomes ‘‘crimmigration’’—a set of norms
                                       which are to large degree administrative, but with the possibility of applying criminal
                                       sanctions ([<a href="#R14">14</a>], pp.&nbsp;293–295). The very process of managing the crisis leads to animated discussions
                                       centered on the values building the migration system. Hence, the doctrine faces the
                                       questions to the effect whether the states have the right to exclude migrants from
                                       social life or whether perhaps it is necessary to reimagine citizenship and guarantee
                                       each third-country national the right to association with the host society ([<a href="#R15">15</a>], pp.&nbsp;152–312). Further doubts are raised by the issue of the regulation of migrant
                                       flows through the territory of the receiving states and concerns over guaranteeing
                                       migrants the right to full mobility ([<a href="#R16">16</a>], p.&nbsp;11–16). To my view, an ideal system of national law should be based on the balancing
                                       of the interests of the receiving society and those of the groups of migrants, as
                                       well as the rights of individual representatives of those groups. What is more, it
                                       should be ensured that the above receive equal protection due to the inherent and
                                       inalienable dignity of each human being. A system of migration law such as this should
                                       be constructed on the following values:

                                                of migration law by the Member States due to the fact that, as P. De Bruycker observes,
                                                ‘‘the EU has developed a real philosophy of migration that respects the human being

                                                of policies and national migration legislation is the concept of solidarity (co-called
                                                normative solidarity) ([<a href="#R19">19</a>], p.&nbsp;151) <b>and commonality</b> (in accordance with the triad proposed by P. De Bruycker: common legislation—common
                                                objectives—common implementation) ([<a href="#R19">19</a>], p.&nbsp;152, [<a href="#R20">20</a>]). The migration law of the Member States impacts the management of the migration
                                                flows in the whole of the European Union and should respect the needs of the whole
                                                of the Union as a community, whereas the national legal system, together with the

                                                law also be constructed in the spirit of <b>solidarism within pluralism</b>, which entails the betterment of the international order, together with respect for
                                                the rights of an individual and human security ([<a href="#R21">21</a>], pp.&nbsp;76–77);

                                                as an exception), proceeded due to the living together principle [<a href="#R23">23</a>, <a href="#R24">24</a>, <a href="#R25">25</a>].

                                       ([<a href="#R26">26</a>], p.&nbsp;150, [<a href="#R27">27</a>], p.&nbsp;244), which concerns, to a large degree, irregular migrants working in the grey
                                       area. In my opinion, the law of the Member States should facilitate the legalization
                                       of the stay of the active members of society, when they do not pose a threat to order
                                       and public security. Such a process in effect is of benefit to all.

                                    <p id="d1e240">All in all, it seems inevitable that modern EU states will be experiencing immigration
                                       at increasing levels. Therefore, adjusting legal norms to the needs resulting from
                                       the dynamics of social phenomena ([<a href="#R28">28</a>], p.&nbsp;23) will be indeed necessary. Such a process entails a meandering art of reaching
                                       difficult compromises, requiring the application of the principle of the golden mean
                                       in order to achieve the right balance between the values in need of protection—the
                                       rights of migrants and those of the receiving society, the two of which do not necessarily
                                       have to mean one and the same thing. The above also entails the ability to <b>dynamically interpret</b> the law by the agencies responsible for its enforcement, which will facilitate an
                                       appropriate granting of protection to the group which requires assistance in the given

                                    <p id="d1e254">The present analysis concentrates on the changes in legislation and the application
                                       of law in the three selected Member States, that is in Italy (which has experienced
                                       one of the greatest migration pressures since 2015) and Germany (which received a
                                       significant number of persons seeking protection during the escalation of the migration
                                       crisis). With the two above belonging to the so-called ‘‘old Member States’’, the
                                       third selected state that comes under scrutiny is Poland, a relatively new Member
                                       State (located outside the main migration routes). Such a selection of legislative
                                       solutions from geographically varied locations provides ample opportunity for illustrating
                                       an array of divergent experiences and needs at the level of creation and application
                                       of migration law. Despite the fact that the selected Member States are obligated to
                                       implement EU law to the same extent, they are faced with entirely different challenges
                                       regarding migration. The present article is in fact complementary to the existing
                                       considerations by the same author with regard to the implementation of the right to
                                       migration security and expands them with an analysis of the situation in the selected
                                       Member States, the illustration of the process of implementation of EU law into national
                                       legal systems and the extent to which national legislators follow the principles of
                                       the migration policy of the EU.

                                    <p id="d1e256">In order to answer the proposed research thesis, two categories of sources have been
                                       subject to analysis. Firstly, they are the sources of law—primarily the acts adopted
                                       in the years 2018-2019 in the selected Member States. The decision to focus on this
                                       period of time was also by no means accidental. It seems that taking into account
                                       the length of the legislation process, the acts adopted in 2018 and 2019, that is
                                       almost three years after the escalation of the migration crisis, are to constitute
                                       long-term solutions for the challenges faced by the Member States, and they are not
                                       merely interim measures. The fact that a certain period of time has elapsed since
                                       the beginning of the escalation of the crisis also allows for a certain perspective
                                       and reflection, as well as a greater objectivity in the adopted measures. Secondly,
                                       the analysis centers on the practical application of the laws by the state administration
                                       authorities and the current jurisprudence of national courts. Due to the broad scope
                                       of the subject under examination, the article is also intended to instigate further
                                       discussion.

                                    <p id="d1e258">As for the methodology for deciding on the case law of the Member States, for obvious
                                       reasons the author had to be selective and make a choice. The analysis of the selected
                                       rulings was based on a qualitative, not quantitative approach. The author assumed
                                       that due to a certain delay in the actions of national legislators, it was the case
                                       law that provided a specific barometer for the necessary actions in the area of migration
                                       management. Simultaneously, case law offers an explicit overview of the problems faced
                                       on a daily basis by both migrants and administrative bodies responsible for their
                                       management. In the choice of the case law, it was crucial whether the doctrine, as
                                       well as various NGOs, took interest in them. The NGOs had to have experience in advancing
                                       the rights of refugees, asylum seekers, and displaced person, as well as be recognizable
                                       in Europe, (ECRE—European Council on Refugees and Exiles, PICUM—Platform for International
                                       Cooperation on Undocumented Migrants). Further, the case law had to fall within the
                                       concern of national and European bodies responsible for the protection of human rights
                                       (European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, Office of the Ombudsman).

                                       Apart from that, due to the dynamics in the shaping of migration processes and their

                                          <p id="d1e275">The first significant and the most controversial change in the law that should be
                                             mentioned is the so-called ‘‘Decreto Salvini’’ [<a href="#R30">30</a>], that is a legal act reforming the Italian asylum system. It was amended after a
                                             few months with the famous Decree 132/2018 [<a href="#R31">31</a>].
                                          </p>
                                          <p id="d1e283">The Decree is an instrument of the realization of Italy’s restrictive policy on migration
                                             and the content of the legal act was written by Matteo Salvini, the leader of ‘‘Lega
                                             Nord’’ since 2013, a party known for its anti-immigration outlook (‘‘Stop Immigrazione’’)
                                             and actions aimed at removing irregular migrants from the territory of Italy [<a href="#R32">32</a>].

                                          <p id="d1e288">In the justification, at the beginning of the decree, it might be read that the aim
                                             of the legal changes is to be able to predict in advance the necessary resources allowing
                                             for individualized granting of residence permits on humanitarian grounds, as well
                                             as the strengthening of the protection of public security [<a href="#R33">33</a>].

                                          <p id="d1e293">As a result, the granting of permissions on humanitarian grounds (humanitarian protection)
                                             became practically impossible after the new legislation had been implemented [<a href="#R34">34</a>, <a href="#R35">35</a>]. Other forms of residence permits were maintained in Italy, but with limited resources
                                             and addressed at a limited circle of beneficiaries [<a href="#R36">36</a>, <a href="#R37">37</a>, <a href="#R38">38</a>]. It is worth emphasizing that a permit to stay for humanitarian reasons allowed
                                             for the regularization of the residence of a foreign national, who did qualify for
                                             international or subsidiary protection, but whose return to the country of origin
                                             would have a high risk of inhuman treatment [<a href="#R39">39</a>].

                                          <p id="d1e314">In the discussion on the subject of the appropriateness of the reform, the constitutionality
                                             of the introduced changes [<a href="#R40">40</a>, <a href="#R41">41</a>] was also contested, also with regard to the adopted form of the decree, which may
                                             become legally binding only in the situation of emergency (in accordance with the
                                             systematics of Italian sources of law, decreto legislative is the so-called fonti
                                             primarie, but in the hierarchy of the sources of law they are located below legge,
                                             that is acts. As Cecilia Corsi argues, it was by no means justifiable to talk about
                                             the state of emergency in the year 2018. What is more, the general number of migrants
                                             arriving to Italy decreased significantly in comparison with 2016 and 2017. Corsi
                                             also points out to the extremely important issue of the correlation between national
                                             law and the norms of international law (in this case the Common European Asylum System)
                                             and the necessity to ensure compliance with the above, in accordance with Art. 10
                                             of the Italian Constitution [<a href="#R42">42</a>]. In the system of the Geneva Convention, the stay for humanitarian reasons allows
                                             for the protection against refoulement of persons being in a special situation, that
                                             is stateless persons, or persons who committed various criminal acts and are excluded
                                             from international protection [<a href="#R43">43</a>]. However, it should be remembered that protection against refoulement is absolute
                                             in nature and the obligation of the Member States to observe it was confirmed by international
                                             courts on numerous occasions [<a href="#R44">44</a>, <a href="#R45">45</a>].

                                          <p id="d1e335">What is also surprising is that the reform initiated by Decreto Salvini revokes the
                                             changes adopted several years ago, both in the area of detention [<a href="#R46">46</a>, <a href="#R47">47</a>, <a href="#R48">48</a>], as well as reception. In accordance with the changes introduced in 2018, persons
                                             seeking international protection are not allowed to stay in the so-called SPRAR centers
                                             (Sistema di protezione richedenti asilo e rifiugiati, created under the legge 189/2002
                                             [<a href="#R49">49</a>]). They are available only to the beneficiaries of international protection and unaccompanied
                                             minors ([<a href="#R50">50</a>], p.&nbsp;15). Persons undergoing the refugee procedure are directed to the so-called
                                             C.A.S.—Centri do accoglienza straordinaria, which do not provide such high reception
                                             standards as SPRAR.

                                             in 2019. This is legge 53/2019 of June 2019 concerning specific regulations in the

                                             need for strengthening the instruments against irregular migration.

                                             acts [<a href="#R56">56</a>]. It is worth pointing out that during the migration crisis, the government of Angela
                                             Merkel declared that Germany would receive all the persons in need of international
                                             protection, acknowledging thus the priority of solidarity within the EU migration
                                             policies [<a href="#R57">57</a>]. As a result of the said declaration, 1 091 894 applications for international protection
                                             were submitted in the Federal Republic of Germany in 2015 [<a href="#R58">58</a>], whereas national bodies became responsible for both examining the applications,
                                             as well as ensuring that the persons concerned have access to social welfare, and
                                             in the case of decisions refusing protection, that they are returned to their country
                                             of origin. Among the most important new legislation one should mention the so-called
                                             ‘‘orderly return act’’. In accordance with the Communication issued by the Minister
                                             for the Internal Affairs on August 21, 2019: ‘‘The law mainly concerns persons whose
                                             applications for asylum were rejected and in the case of whom, after an extensive
                                             legal procedure, it was established that they are not in need of protection under
                                             any scope and that they must leave the territory of the Federal Republic. The law
                                             implements the agreement of the governing parties in the coalition agreement and the
                                             preparation of the project for the general migration plan’’ [<a href="#R59">59</a>]. The provisions of the law are aimed primarily at facilitating the realization of
                                             effective returns, especially in the case of third-country nationals who notoriously
                                             keep avoiding cooperation at the realization of the return. In accordance with paragraph
                                             60b, a new residence permit was introduced in the form of ‘‘tolerance for persons
                                             with unexplained identity’’, which is issued to third-country nationals whose expulsion
                                             cannot take place, due to the fact that they create obstacles which prevent deportation.
                                             The obstacles defined in the act include fraud concerning one’s identity and a lack
                                             of initiative in obtaining a travel document, which would not entail, and this is
                                             a key word here, an ‘‘excessive burden on the foreign national’’ [<a href="#R60">60</a>].
                                          </p>
                                          <p id="d1e393">The act also narrows down the understanding of the term ‘‘reasonable grounds to suspect
                                             absconding’’, which is one of the provisions for placing a foreign national with an
                                             obligation to return in detention [<a href="#R61">61</a>]. The act enumerates six provisions justifying the determination whether there exist
                                             reasonable grounds to suspect absconding and in the light of the way the said Article
                                             is drafted, it should be assumed that the list is of a closed character (par. 62(3a)).
                                             It is worth mentioning that the said catalogue includes, for instance, fraud committed
                                             by a foreign national regarding his identity, failure of a foreign national to appear
                                             in person for an interview, the expiration of the period to return, previous evasion
                                             of return or a prominent statement on the lack of will to cooperate in the realization
                                             of the return. What is interesting, the act was amended in paragraph 62 with paragraph
                                             3b, which, as it were, specifies the circumstances listed in paragraph 3a. The concrete
                                             provisions of the risk of absconding listed in the act include, among others, situations
                                             when a foreign national participated in the smuggling procedure in order to get into
                                             the territory of Germany from a third country, additionally paying the guides; when
                                             a foreign national poses a significant threat to the health and life of third persons
                                             or legal goods of considerable value related to the internal security; when a foreign
                                             national was convicted several times with at least one sentence of imprisonment for
                                             a crime committed intentionally; resides illegally in Germany without having a permanent
                                             place of residence and due to that remains unavailable to institutions.
                                          </p>
                                          <p id="d1e398">The act also regulates the procedure of detaining a foreign national for the period
                                             of ten days in order to remove him from the country. Such detention may occur irrespective
                                             of the fact whether the conditions for placing him in detention are met and it is
                                             executed by order of the court. Moreover, the authority competent to examine the request
                                             for deportation was mandated to be able to detain a foreign national without a prior
                                             court order under the said law provided that the conditions under par. 62b(4)(1–3)
                                             [<a href="#R62">62</a>] are met. However, after detention, the foreign national should without delay appear
                                             before the court so that a decision on detention with a view to removing a foreign
                                             national from the country is issued.

                                          <p id="d1e403">In 2019 the Federal Republic of Germany also introduced The Third Law on the Modification

                                             law after the escalation of the crisis in 2015. It resulted primarily from the fact
                                             that the Republic of Poland, as a typical transit country, did not experience in the
                                             recent years any significant influx of third-country nationals seeking international

                                             synthetical way by two fundamental legal acts: The Act on Foreigners of 2013 and the
                                             Act on granting protection to foreigners within the territory of the Republic of Poland
                                             dated 2003—both amended on several occasions [<a href="#R68">68</a>]. The last significant amendments in the area of refugee and return law concerned,
                                             among others, the introduction of the so-called procedure of fast-track examination
                                             of applications for international protection (Art. 39 of the Act on granting protection,
                                             as amended in 2019), which might be applied, among others, in the case when a foreign
                                             national gives incoherent evidence regarding alleged persecution in the country of
                                             origin, ‘‘submitted an application merely to delay or interrupt the execution of the
                                             decision to obligate a foreign national to return’’ or ‘‘poses a threat to state security
                                             or public order or was for that reason previously removed from the territory of the
                                             Republic of Poland’’ [<a href="#R69">69</a>]. Fast-track procedures were recognized by the Court of Justice of the EU as compliant
                                             with the rules of the Common European Asylum System and the guarantees of the Procedure
                                             Directive (formerly Directive 2005/85, currently Directive 2013/32) [<a href="#R70">70</a>]. In 2019, the provision of the Act on granting protection under Art. 86f was amended
                                             (Providing public information on the threat for the defense or security of the state
                                             from a foreign national). It allows for not qualifying for relocation or resettlement
                                             a third-country national who could pose a threat for the defense or security of the
                                             state or for the protection of security and public order. To sum up, the changes in
                                             Polish law were not of a systemic character.

                                             human rights. To a large extent, national courts rely on legal international obligations

                                             protection. An interesting judgement in this area was handed down by the court of
                                             appeals in Bologna, which upheld the judgement of the court of first instance, granting
                                             protection for humanitarian reasons to a citizen of Ukraine from the region of Ternopil.
                                             The granting of protection was justified by the worsening living conditions of the
                                             applicant due to the ongoing conflict in the Donbass region [<a href="#R73">73</a>, <a href="#R74">74</a>]. This judgement is interesting in as much as Ukraine in general is considered to

                                             internal migrations are possible within the Ukrainian territory. Likewise, the Ukrainian
                                             authorities are expected to offer assistance in the case of the so-called internal

                                             nationals. An interesting judgement in this respect was handed down by the Administrative
                                             tribunal for the Veneto Region, which cancelled the decision of administrative authorities
                                             suspending access to reception benefits for an asylum seeker who was aggressive and
                                             did not cooperate with the authorities in the course of the procedure. The Tribunal
                                             took a stance that behaviors justifying the refusal of reception benefits were not
                                             proven [<a href="#R75">75</a>].

                                          <p id="d1e467">From among the judgements by the courts of a lower level in migration cases, it is
                                             worth mentioning the judgement of Tribunale di Roma of November 28, 2019 in which
                                             the court allowed the right to compensation with regard to fourteen foreign nationals
                                             expelled collectively to Libya on the grounds of the agreement of cooperation signed
                                             by Italy and Libya [<a href="#R76">76</a>]. Collective expulsions are banned under Art. 4 of the Additional Protocol no. 4
                                             to the European Convention on Human Rights, whereas the agreement between Italy and
                                             Libya allowing for transfers of irregular migrants was criticized on multiple occasions
                                             by human rights defenders [<a href="#R77">77</a>]. Unfortunately, everything seems to indicate that the government of the Italian
                                             Republic does not see the threats to which it exposes migrants by sending them back
                                             to Libya. This is further strengthened by the decision to continue cooperation with
                                             the African partner, undertaken at the beginning of this year [<a href="#R78">78</a>]. Such a direction of Italian policy met with strong criticism from, among others,
                                             the Council of Europe [<a href="#R79">79</a>].

                                             21, 2019 by a court in Rome (Tribunale Ordinario di Roma, Sezione Diritti della Persona
                                             e Immigrazione). The case concerned the entry of a minor child of a Nigerian national—the
                                             mother was staying in Italy and the child in Libya. The national court decided that
                                             the child may be granted the right of entry under Art. 25 of the Community Code on
                                             Visas, which allows the authorities of the Member States to issue the so-called visa
                                             with limited territorial validity, among others, in a situation when a Member State
                                             deems it necessary to issue such a visa for humanitarian reasons (Art. 25(1)(a)).

                                          <p id="d1e483">The court held that the issuing of such a visa lies in the best interest of the child
                                             and is justifiable both on the grounds of the constitutional guarantees for the protection
                                             of human rights (the right to family unity and the right to health—the child of the
                                             Nigerian national required immediate medical treatment), a well as under the obligations
                                             transpiring from the European Convention on Human Rights (Art. 8—the right to protection
                                             of family life), even more so as the current situation in Nigeria (the country of
                                             origin of the family) does not guarantee appropriate medical assistance to the child
                                             of the foreign national. This ruling constitutes, as it were, the continuation of
                                             the line of jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the EU in the case of X and X
                                             v. Belgium (C 638/16) in which the Court held that the issuing of humanitarian visas
                                             is possible only on the grounds of national law, and not the Union law [<a href="#R80">80</a>].

                                             cases. From among the judgements issued in the years 2018-2019, it is worth citing
                                             primarily the judgement of November 13, 2019 [<a href="#R81">81</a>], in which the Court held that social integration of the migrant is not a sufficient
                                             condition to grant such a person authorization to stay for humanitarian reasons. As
                                             it was demonstrated in the previous section of the article, Decreto Salvini limited
                                             to a large degree the possibility of granting authorization to stay for humanitarian
                                             reasons. Despite the fact that the ruling of the court upheld the stance of the government,
                                             it is not contrary to international obligations due to the fact that the authorization
                                             to stay for humanitarian reasons is issued to persons whose return to their country
                                             of origin would expose them to inhuman treatment [<a href="#R82">82</a>, <a href="#R83">83</a>].

                                          <p id="d1e499">However, it seems that the Supreme Court in Italy is a court adopting a pro-human-rights
                                             line of jurisprudence, taking into consideration the recent case law in migration
                                             matters. Such an opinion may be justified by a ruling issued also on November 13,
                                             2019, in which the court excluded retroactive application of the Decreto Salvini with
                                             regard to third-country nationals who submitted application for international protection
                                             before October 5, 2018 [<a href="#R84">84</a>]. Moreover, in the judgement handed down on October 10, 2019, the Supreme Court obligated
                                             the judges who ruled in the first and second instance on migration cases to refer
                                             to the information on the countries of origin in the cases in which the granting of
                                             subsidiary protection status was refused [<a href="#R85">85</a>]. An exceptionally broad interpretation of the concept of ‘‘legally residing foreigner’’
                                             for the purpose of acknowledging the right of a foreign national to legal aid was
                                             made by the Supreme Court in the ruling of January 5, 2018. The court took a stance
                                             that a broader interpretation of the concept should also include situations in which
                                             a foreign national remains in the procedure which might hypothetically result in the
                                             granting of international protection or a residence permit. In the opinion of the
                                             court, a foreign national may be deemed as ‘‘irregular’’ only after the issuing of
                                             the decision ordering his return to the country of origin, but even then, he should
                                             be entitled to legal aid, if he is to appeal against that decision [<a href="#R86">86</a>].

                                          <p id="d1e510">Undoubtedly, one of the best-known cases in Italy in recent years was the case of
                                             Carola Rackete, captain of the sea rescue ship Sea Watch 3, which took on board 53
                                             persons on international waters on June 12, 2019. The migrants included nationals
                                             of Nigeria, Guinea, Cameron, Mali, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Burkina Faso and Guinea-Conakry.
                                             The ship captain justified her rescue activities as acting under Art. 98 of the Montego
                                             Bay Convention. Due to the legge 53/2019 adopted in Italy, the Minister has competence
                                             to issue a prohibition of entry of a ship into the port. This is what happened in
                                             the case of Sea Watch 3. Captain Rackete decided that the nearest safe harbor for
                                             the migrants would be Lampedusa (in her opinion, neither the ports in Libya nor Tunis
                                             could be considered safe, as Tunis is not party to the Geneva Convention of 1951).
                                             On June 21, 2019 she applied to the European Court of Human Rights for the issuing
                                             of the interim measure allowing for disembarkation, justifying the need for such a
                                             measure with the guarantees under Art. 2 and 3 of the European Convention on Human
                                             Rights. The Court refused to grant interim measures on June 25, 2019 [<a href="#R87">87</a>] and in consequence Sea Watch 3 entered the harbor in Lampedusa without authorization,
                                             colliding with sea patrol boats which tried to intercept her. Captain Rackete was
                                             arrested, however, in the ruling issued on June 30, 2019 the court in Agrigento cleared
                                             her of all the charges [<a href="#R88">88</a>]. In the justification it was emphasized that Captain Rackete’s actions were within
                                             law—especially with regard to Art. 18 of the Convention on the Law of the Sea, defining
                                             the term ‘‘passage’’ in accordance with which ‘‘[it] includes stopping and anchoring,
                                             but only in so far as the same are incidental to ordinary navigation or are rendered
                                             necessary by force majeure or distress or for the purpose of rendering assistance
                                             to persons, ships or aircraft in danger or distress’’ (Art. 18(2)). Apart from that,
                                             justification for Captain Rackete’s actions could be found under Art. 10 decreto legislative
                                             286/98, in accordance with which refoulement is not to be executed in the case of
                                             matters relevant to international protection (Art. 10(4)) [<a href="#R89">89</a>].

                                             cases highlights the basic difference of this case law in comparison to that of Italian
                                             courts. Indeed, German cases concern primarily the issues regarding the provisions
                                             of the Dublin Regulation, that is the one that is currently in force: Regulation (EU)
                                             no. 604/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of June 26, 2013 establishing

                                             a third-country national or a stateless person ([<a href="#R90">90</a>], pp.&nbsp;31–59).

                                          <p id="d1e529">The first group of rulings which were handed down in the years 2018–2019 was quite
                                             numerous and concerned the prohibition of the transfer of foreign nationals from Germany
                                             to other Member States. In accordance with regulation 604/2013, the initiation of
                                             the transfer procedure occurs on the grounds of Art. 21 of the Regulation 604/2013.
                                             German administrative courts ruled on the prohibition of transfers to the countries
                                             of origin, in which persons seeking international protection might be exposed to the
                                             risk of inhuman treatment. This was the situation concerning a single mother of Syrian
                                             nationality, who was to be returned together with her three children to Romania [<a href="#R91">91</a>]. In the judgement, the administrative court in Düsseldorf justified the prohibition
                                             of transfer with the possibility of exposing the family, entirely dependent on state

                                             significant, the administrative court referred in its reasoning to the judgement of
                                             the European Court of Human Rights in the case of Tarakhel [<a href="#R92">92</a>]. Further, the Federal Administrative Court of Germany in the ruling of August 20,
                                             2018 upheld the judgement of the administrative court of Lower Germany handing down
                                             that the return of foreign nationals from Germany to Bulgaria would expose them to
                                             the risk of inhuman treatment [<a href="#R93">93</a>]. German courts expressed their negative opinions also on the subject of transfers
                                             from Germany to Italy—this is was the stance of the administrative court in Augsburg
                                             in the ruling of November 2, 2018, stating in its reasoning that there was a lack
                                             of individual guarantees from the side of Italy and referring to the ruling in the
                                             case of Tarakhel [<a href="#R94">94</a>]. In the judgement of April 25, 2019, the administrative court in Arnsberg ruled
                                             that the transfer from Germany to France be suspended on the grounds of a possible
                                             breach of Art. 3 of the European Convention of Human Rights.

                                             Greece was taken by the administrative court in Magdeburg. In the judgement of November
                                             13, 2018, the court ruled the interim measure with regard to a third-country national
                                             who was given refugee status in Greece and then submitted an application for protection
                                             in Germany. The German court held that the return of the migrant to Greece would expose
                                             him to a real risk of inhuman treatment [<a href="#R95">95</a>].

                                             Court in Bavaria (judgement of May 9, 2019). However, the case was atypical in as
                                             much as it concerned the execution of return on the grounds of a bilateral agreement
                                             concluded between Germany and Greece, before the initiation of the transfer procedure
                                             under the Dublin Regulation. The administrative court in Munich also expressed its
                                             doubts with regard to the so-called ‘‘pre-Dublin procedure’’ [<a href="#R96">96</a>]. The case concerned an Afghan seeking international protection who was returned
                                             to Greece on the grounds of the bilateral agreement—the administrative court ordered
                                             that the third-country national’s re-entering Germany from Greece should be facilitated
                                             in such a way as to fully guarantee the foreign national his rights resulting from

                                             2019). The foreign national submitted an application for refugee status in Greece,
                                             but his application was recognized as inadmissible due to the fact that the Syrian
                                             arrived in Greece from Turkey and it was Turkey that was considered to be ‘‘The First

                                             a third-country national to Greece, he was at risk of the so-called <i>chain refoulement</i> to Turkey, which in the court’s view did not effectively implement the provisions
                                             of the Geneva Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees of 1951.

                                             family reunification. In this field, the case law was pro human rights. To give some
                                             examples, in the judgement of September 4, 2018, the Higher Administrative Court of
                                             Berlin-Brandenburg ruled on the possibility of family reunification and the necessity
                                             of granting an interim measure in the case when a minor who is subject to family reunification
                                             is soon to be eighteen years of age [<a href="#R98">98</a>]. Further, the administrative court in Munster ruled that due to the existing risk
                                             of violating the fundamental right to family unity, in the best interest of the child,
                                             the German administrative bodies should accept the <i>take chargé request</i> from Greece, submitted after the expiry time limit, so as to allow the Syrian siblings
                                             family reunification [<a href="#R99">99</a>]. In a similar way and on the basis of the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice
                                             of the EU (judgement in the case of X and X) [<a href="#R100">100</a>], the administrative court in Berlin held that the rejection of the <i>take chargé</i> request from Greece by migration authorities was unlawful. However, as the court
                                             emphasized, the legal norms contained in the Dublin Regulation should be interpreted
                                             in the light of Art. 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights and to protect the

                                             The cases concerning foreign nationals are usually proceeded by administrative courts,
                                             as the procedures regarding the refugee status are examined in the administrative
                                             procedure and in the majority of cases migrants appeal against the decisions refusing
                                             refugee status or against the decisions refusing entry to the territory of the Republic
                                             of Poland [<a href="#R101">101</a>].

                                          <p id="d1e588">The first and probably the most reported issue concerns the refusal of entry with
                                             regard to foreign nationals who declare the willingness to apply for refugee status
                                             and arrive at the border in Terespol. Terespol is a border crossing point between
                                             Belarus and Poland and therefore it is located on the external border of the EU. Terespol
                                             is a border crossing point for third-country migrants, especially from Chechenia,
                                             who want to get to the European Union via Belarus and receive international protection
                                             on account of being persecuted in their country of origin. Having declared an intention
                                             to apply for the refugee status, such persons should be directed for further assessment
                                             and subjected to a detailed examination regarding their personal situation. However,
                                             as it transpires from the reports and case law presented below, third-country nationals
                                             are refused the opportunity to lodge an application, despite the fact that they often
                                             arrive at the border crossing point multiple times. In such cases, they are sent back
                                             to Belarus, where they might experience further persecution due to the dependence
                                             of the Belarus regime on Russia.

                                          <p id="d1e590">This issue was analyzed in greater detail in an article prepared by the Helsinki Foundation
                                             for Human Rights and published in April 2019 [<a href="#R102">102</a>]. On the basis of the analyzed material, it transpires that the complainants challenging
                                             the decisions refusing entry declared that they were willing to apply for refugee
                                             status and therefore, under the law, there was no possibility to issue a negative
                                             decision in this respect ([<a href="#R102">102</a>], p.&nbsp;31). The authors of the report state that as of the day of drafting the report,
                                             the Provincial Administrative Court (WSA) in Warsaw ruled in 59 of such complaints
                                             and in 25 cases quashed the decisions which were unfavorable for foreign nationals
                                             [<a href="#R102">102</a>]. Moving further, 33 rulings of the Provincial Administrative Court were brought
                                             before the Supreme Administrative Court (NSA) as a cassation complaint. In its line
                                             of jurisprudence, the NSA focused on the interpretation of Art. 28 of the Act on foreigners.
                                             In the view of the court, the provisions of this Article should be interpreted in
                                             the light of the principle of non-refoulement [<a href="#R103">103</a>]. The Supreme Administrative Court held in its rulings that the border guards, that
                                             is administrative agencies, were obligated to determine the factual reasons of a foreign
                                             national’s entry into the territory of Poland and therefore there were no grounds
                                             for applying Art. 34(2) of the Act on foreigners, in accordance with which, ‘‘Activities
                                             undertaken as part of the proceedings referred to in paragraph 1 may be limited to
                                             checking only the documents held by the foreigner if the grounds for the foreigner’s
                                             failure to meet the conditions required to cross the border do not raise any doubts’’.

                                          <p id="d1e604">To illustrate the above, in the reasoning of the judgement rejecting the cassation
                                             complaint and therefore acknowledging that a foreign national was right in filing
                                             for revoking of the decision, the Supreme Administrative Court held that “Even if
                                             at the border crossing point there occurred some instances of certain misuse of the
                                             refugee procedure by some foreign nationals who used the key words ‘‘asylum’’ or ‘‘refugee’’
                                             without the actual understanding of their meaning, and even if the Border Guard is
                                             facing organizational challenges with regard to managing border control activities
                                             for a large number of foreign nationals who do not have visas or any other residence
                                             titles entitling them to enter into and stay on the territory of Poland, which results
                                             in, e.g. a considerable shortening of the time that could be devoted to one person,
                                             the above cannot justify such laconic documentation of the course of the interview
                                             with a foreign national on the so-called ‘‘second line’’ as that that can be found
                                             in the present case file in the report of […] February 2017 [<a href="#R104">104</a>]. In the further part of the reasoning, the formation of the court emphasized that
                                             the first instance court rightly held that the administration agency, in this case
                                             the Border Guard, prematurely concluded that the case was obvious and did not require
                                             any further inquiry.

                                          <p id="d1e609">In the examined cases, the Supreme Administrative Court emphasized that the interviewing

                                             wanting to apply for international protection is also emphasized by the cases directed
                                             to the European Court of Human Rights, as for instance in the case of D.A. and others
                                             v. Poland [<a href="#R106">106</a>] or in the case of M.A. and others v. Poland [<a href="#R107">107</a>].

                                             including also persons seeking international protection is played by the Office of
                                             the Ombudsman. The Ombudsman visits the borders, including its most problematic section
                                             in Terespol [<a href="#R108">108</a>] and actively exercises his powers conferred on him by the Act on the Ombudsman [<a href="#R109">109</a>]. An example of the Ombudsman’s successful intervention is the fact that the NSA
                                             took account of a cassation complaint submitted by the Ombudsman in the case concerning
                                             a national of Chechenia who was refused international protection. In the judgement
                                             of December 18, 2019, the Supreme Administrative Court referred the case back for
                                             re-examination deciding that the Council on Refugees had not fully explained the factual
                                             aspects of the matter [<a href="#R110">110</a>, <a href="#R111">111</a>].

                                          <p id="d1e634">The administrative courts in Poland also deal with return cases, that is, appeals
                                             against the decisions obligating to return. Indeed, in the judgement of September
                                             19, 2019, the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the cassation appeal of the Head

                                             after it was orally translated to her and after she signed a required statement. In
                                             the opinion of the court of the first instance, the foreign national concerned was
                                             not properly informed, in accordance with the existing procedures, about the consequences
                                             of the renouncing of the right to appeal, as such information should be conveyed in
                                             writing and in the language understood by the foreign national. This stance was upheld
                                             by the formation of the court of the Supreme Administrative Court.

                                             issue of detention of families with children. Despite the judgement of the European

                              <p id="d1e650">The analysis of legal provisions and the case law in migration matters conducted in
                                 the article does not allow for offering a definitive answer to the question whether
                                 in Italy, the Federal Republic of Germany and Poland the principle of migration security
                                 priority and the right to migration security are realized at the national level. Such
                                 an ambiguous answer to the research question does not result from insufficient background
                                 research into the substance of the matter and its analysis, but from the very character
                                 of national legislation—a large number of scattered legal acts, various modifications
                                 and primarily the character of migration policy realized by the Member States. Traditionally,
                                 national states protect their sovereignty and prioritize the protection of national
                                 security and public order, whereas the acts of EU law facilitate the harmonization
                                 of actions at the level of the EU and the implementation of the standards of the protection
                                 of migrants’ rights in a more effective way. In as much as the Union has the possibility
                                 of harmonization (through directives) and unification (through regulations) of the
                                 standards on treatment of third-country nationals, it does not possess the competence
                                 to introduce common standards with regard to the issues of national security, which
                                 remain within the competence of the Member States.At the legislative level, the Member
                                 States focus primarily on ensuring security to the receiving society. Even if it is
                                 justifiable to say that the adopted changes safeguard a higher level of security,
                                 it concerns in the first place, public security (Italian and German acts) and not
                                 the security of the migrant as a fully-fledged participant of the migration process.
                                 Hence, on the basis of the analyzed legal acts, especially Italian and German legislation,
                                 it appears reasonable to claim that, unfortunately, the national law protects to a
                                 greater degree the security of the host country and in this way, it decreases the
                                 protection of the interests of foreign nationals seeking international protection
                                 or remaining under the return procedure.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e652">With regard to the axiological model of migration security discussed at the beginning
                                 of the present study, it should be noted that, to a large degree, it is implemented
                                 in the jurisprudence of national courts. The application of asylum and return law
                                 should be exercised with a special inclusion of the postulate of solidarity and the
                                 protection of migrants’ rights. The analyzed case law of the Polish, German and Italian
                                 courts clearly indicates that they adopt a pro human rights approach and make the
                                 best interest of the migrant their priority.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e654">With reference to the postulate of creating an ideal national system of migration
                                 law discussed at the beginning of the article, it appears that in the current legal
                                 situation and due to the division of competence between the EU and the Member States,
                                 it might seem difficult to accomplish. First of all, it might be due to a lack of
                                 instruments of direct democracy and no direct possibility for the people to take a
                                 stance with reference to the shape of migration policy (<b>right to self-determination</b>). There is no doubt that even in the case of resorting to the instrument of referendum,
                                 voters would need an objective information campaign especially on the contribution
                                 of migrants into the economic life of the receiving society. Nevertheless, what is
                                 of significant importance for the creation of the national legal system is the guarantees
                                 of EU law with regard to the protection of migrants’ fundamental rights, which remain,
                                 in fact, irrebuttable (in accordance with Art. 18 and 19 of the Charter of Fundamental
                                 Rights and the provisions of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union),
                                 constituting a certain safety buffer for migrants in the legal regulations passed
                                 by national legislators in the Member States. The implementation of the principle
                                 of <b>solidarity</b> and <b>commonality</b> is also protected by EU law and the directives adopted within the Area of Freedom,
                                 Security and Justice, as the governments of the Member States are rather focused on
                                 the protection of their particular interests. <b>Integration</b> remains a challenge for the future, but there is no question that the shaping of
                                 fair rules in this area will also belong to the EU, whereas the effective implementation
                                 of those regulations will remain in the hands of the Member States.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e668">A postulate which, hopefully, might be more feasible to realize in the future is that
                                 of increasing the importance of the right to self-determination and making the voice
                                 of civil society be heard by the governments. Without doubt, the increasing activity
                                 of the organizations from the third sector serves this purpose and their pursuits
                                 may well provide ample material for further study.

                                          submitting a cassation complaint should be given credit, to the effect that such significant

                                          in the presence of his/her legal representative, if such had been appointed. However,
                                          the specificity of the proceed- ings requires assuming that such an obligation exists
                                          on the side of the administration only when the legal representative had already been
                                          appointed and is present at the moment of crossing the border, whereas the appointing
                                          of a legal representative does not have to entail the submission of the authorization
                                          documents”.
