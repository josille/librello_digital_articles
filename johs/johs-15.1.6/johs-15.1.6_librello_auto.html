                                 actors (VNSAs) in South America. Based on a case study of the border area between
                                 Colombia and Venezuela, the research relies on a broad empirical data collected from
                                 newspapers, official documents and interviews. The analytical perspective has been
                                 grounded on a theoretical framework of four dimensions: (i) funding and illegal activities,
                                 (ii) presence in strategic regions, (iii) low state presence and (iv) violence, which
                                 identifies different forms of presence of VNSAs. When questioned about how VNSAs create
                                 new forms of alternative governance in a territorial space of fragile statehood, the
                                 results tend to reveal a context in which state governance seems to overlap the alternative
                                 and illegal governance of VNSAs, creating a fragile and hybrid governance in the region.</span></div>

                              <p id="d1e93">Levitsky (2008) identified the existence of black spots in territorial spaces to indicate
                                 fruitful areas for operations conducted by illegal groups and suggested that: “‘Black
                                 spots’ (or ‘black holes’) are localized areas within a state, over which the government
                                 has no formal governance. The type of order prevailing in those territories is almost
                                 always unknown by government authorities and the international community.” [<a href="#R01">1</a>] Security agencies and scholars [<a href="#R02">2</a>, <a href="#R03">3</a>, <a href="#R04">4</a>] have little oversight of “black spots” in Latin America, transforming them in fertile
                                 ground for insurgent groups, narcotraffickers and criminals to freely develop illicit
                                 activities, indistinguishable if “black spots” are located in developed or developing
                                 territories, and independently from the various possibilities of dimensions they are
                                 presenting
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e107">In Latin America, as well as in other regions of the world, “black spots” are formed
                                 in places where the governance of the state is deficitary, lacking in the guarantee
                                 of basic services to the population of those regions, and causing a vacuum that would
                                 be soon filled by the non-governmental authority of non-state armed groups—or more
                                 precisely, Violent Non-State Actors (VNSAs)—that also conduct activities such as money
                                 laundering, arms trafficking, trafficking in persons, kidnapping, smuggling, extortion,
                                 as well as common and political crimes. States that present social and dysfunctional
                                 institutions, such as Mexico, countries that are part of the Northern Triangle of
                                 Central America (Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador), countries bordering the Amazon
                                 region and those located on the triple border area in South America (Brazil, Paraguay,
                                 Argentina) can all be examples of states presenting difficulties in monitoring and
                                 generating the effective development within their border environments [<a href="#R05">5</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e112">Some causal dimensions have favored the presence and strengthening of VNSAs in Latin
                                 America. First, the solid sources of funding of VNSAs achieved through illicit activities;
                                 second, and linked to a traditional dimension, the low state presence in the development
                                 of public policies, that has reinforced VNSAs in strategic regions; third, expression
                                 of the relational dimension, the VNSAs questioning of the state monopoly of force.
                                 However, the explanatory dimensions of VNSAs in Latin American black spots can not
                                 be attributed solely to those three dimensions.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e114">The paper explores determinant variables (dimensions) to explain different levels
                                 of governance in the area located at the border, between Colombia and Venezuela. In
                                 turn, we seek to find evidences supporting our claim about the structure on dimensions
                                 to identify how VNSAs create an alternative governance on borders. Therefore, we will
                                 examine the presence and actions of VNSAs in a fragile zone like the Colombian territory
                                 at the border with Venezuela, that has become a critical spot in the South American
                                 territory, as indicate by some researchers [<a href="#R02">2</a>, <a href="#R06">6</a>, <a href="#R07">7</a>]. And the exact critical nature of this area has been the criterion of choice for
                                 our case study over black spots.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e125">Thus, the current paper designs a theoretical framework that establishes a nexus between
                                 VNSAs’ access to funding, geographical scope, use of violence and low state presence.
                                 We use the structure of dimensions to identify how VNSAs develop alternative governance
                                 on frontiers.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e127">The analysis of those dimensions through which VNSAs operate on the Colombian border
                                 with Venezuela is made through the description of different kind of VNSAs and their
                                 activities based on empirical data collected from documents, consisting of approximately
                                 100 daily newspaper articles published between 2012 and 2016. Among the Colombian
                                 daily newspapers, we have analysed articles published by El Tiempo, The Herald, InSight
                                 Crime, The Colombian. On the other side, Venezuelan daily newspapers, like El Nacional,
                                 El Universal and La Verdad, have been used. These newspapers have been relevant for
                                 the understanding of: (i) the location of the VNSAs region of operation, (ii) the
                                 actors involved and (iii) the type of illegal activity. Certainly, although newspapers
                                 are not the most consistent source of data, they are very helpful to enlighten the
                                 researcher when it comes to investigate the practices of groups carrying out illicit
                                 activities. “Newspapers help to show what information policymakers had and provide
                                 clues as to what events they regarded as important. In this way, newspapers help us
                                 to recapture the perspective of officials at the time ([<a href="#R08">8</a>], p.108). For the purposes of this paper, interviews with an academic and a military
                                 both in Caracas and Bogota, were taken. Interviews represent complementary sources
                                 as ”the use of multiple sources is one way to enhance the construct validity of operational
                                 definitions” [<a href="#R09">9</a>].

                                 first one is presenting the theoretical debate on VNSAs and theirs dimensions. Subsequently,
                                 we define the empirical assessment of the presence of VNSAs on the border between
                                 Colombia and Venezuela, where they have developed new ways of governance. In the third
                                 section, the theoretical framework is applied to the empirical data and connected
                                 to each dimension to explain how formal governance is affected by the actions and
                                 motivations of VNSAs. In the last section, we explore the initial argument about alternative
                                 governance on the Colombian and Venezuelan borders in order to offer some conclusions.

                              <p id="d1e140">The complex nature of governance is further complicated by the emergence and growing
                                 importance of institutions, movements and formations that have their origins in the
                                 effects of and reactions to globalization. The emergence of these new forces is a
                                 consequence of poor state performance, and their activities can contribute to the
                                 further weakening of state structures. Where management state agencies are incapable
                                 of delivering (or unwilling to deliver) security and other basic services, and where
                                 traditional societal structures have been substantially undermined, people will turn
                                 to other social entities for support. In this situation, the actors perceived as powerful
                                 and effective include warlords and their militias in outlying regions, gang leaders
                                 in townships and squatter settlements, vigilante-type organizations, ethnically-based
                                 protection rackets, millenarian religious movements, transnational networks of extended
                                 family relations, organized crime or new forms of tribalism. [<a href="#R10">10</a>] Occasionally, these new formations have seized power in certain regions of a given
                                 state’s territory (be it a remote mountainous peripheral location or a squatter settlement
                                 in the capital city). They have shown the capacity to exert violence on a large scale
                                 against outsiders and the capacity to control violence within their respective strongholds
                                 [<a href="#R10">10</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e148">On the other hand, the intrusion of state agencies impacts on non-state local orders
                                 too. Customary systems of order are subjected to deconstruction and re-formation as
                                 they are incorporated into central state structures and processes. They adopt an ambiguous
                                 position with regard to the state, appropriating state functions and ‘state talk’,
                                 but at the same time pursuing their own agenda under the guise of the state authority
                                 and power. Taking state functions and state talk on board, however, also means changing
                                 one’s original stance. Some governments also try to deliberately incorporate traditional
                                 authorities, in order to strengthen state capacities and legitimacy [<a href="#R10">10</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e153">Levitsky identified black spots as fruitful areas for operations conducted by illegal
                                 groups and a first definition may be: <i>““Black spots” (or “black holes”) are localized areas within a state, over which the
                                    government has no formal governance. The type of order prevailing in those territories
                                    is almost always unknown by government authorities and the international community”</i> ([<a href="#R01">1</a>] p. 393). Black spots or “lawless spaces” are areas that are not governed by the
                                 state and underlie different forms of governance and authority, often even in a hybrid
                                 way, with the participation of state actors or agencies. For this reason, the Global
                                 Black Spot Group, that has been researching and classifying violent non-state actors’
                                 blacks spots, holds that:
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e161">“Transnational vicious non-state actors use Black Spots as locations between which
                                 they can operate undisturbed and out of sight of international law enforcement, intelligence,
                                 and security agencies. (…) What they transfer in, out, and between Black Spots are
                                 insecurity flows, defined as movements of assets, people, services, or sensitive know
                                 how in pursuit of illicit criminal or political gain, and with intention of evading
                                 law enforcement, intelligence, and related national and international agencies. Being
                                 able to pinpoint and monitor Black Spots on an ongoing basis offers the possibility
                                 of tracking the movement of criminals and terrorists, their financial assets and illegal
                                 weapons, and their skills and expertise. Such a capability is critical to intelligence
                                 gathering and necessary precondition for threat interception and the prevention of
                                 the escalation of insecurity” [<a href="#R11">11</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e166">In spaces where there is a functional absence of the State, both informal economy
                                 and low social security conditions spill over into other societies, leading to violence
                                 and corrupt practices ([<a href="#R12">12</a>] p. 42). Williams affirms that borders are spaces where: “the strategy of the state
                                 territoriality is dramatized and state sovereignty is paraded. It is also here that
                                 many countervailing strategies contesting state territoriality are clustered” ([<a href="#R12">12</a>] p. 44). In these frontier areas, VNSAs are able to generate governance and sometimes
                                 to keep peace. In many cases, black spots are formed in places experiencing a deficit
                                 of governance of the state, which does not guarantee basic services to the population
                                 of those regions, causing a vacuum to be soon filled by the governmental authority
                                 of various informal and illegal groups. “Territorial sovereignty is being diminished
                                 on a spectrum of issues in such a serious manner as to subvert the capacity of states
                                 to control and protect the internal life of society, and non-state actors hold and
                                 increasing proportion of power and influence in the shaping of world order” ([<a href="#R02">2</a>] p. 25).

                              <p id="d1e177">From a policing perspective, several borders in the hemisphere experience great international
                                 insecurity, which intersect with international relations. In many cases, conflicts
                                 in border zones have escalated amid border banditry and the smuggling of people, drugs,
                                 and guns, creating tensions both between countries and among actors in borderlands.
                                 Other border zones are peaceful precisely because of the actions of illegal actors
                                 that establish and maintain order [<a href="#R05">5</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e182">Thus, there is a general tendency coming from governments to notice some actors operating
                                 in “black spot”, such as the aforementioned groups, with threats to international
                                 security. This is especially true in the border areas of Latin American that can be
                                 considered black spots, where non-state armed groups—or more precisely Violent Non-State
                                 Actors (VNSAs)— conduct activities such as money laundering, arms trafficking, trafficking
                                 in persons, kidnapping, smuggling, extortion, common and political crime. Krause and
                                 Milliken identify in these “black spots” at least six categories of VNSAS—militias,
                                 warlords, private security providers, urban gangs, and transnational and criminal
                                 networks, which facilitate a wider exploration of how such groups form in relation
                                 to the state, and how the state in turn is shaped through its interactions and conflict
                                 with the armed group(s). [<a href="#R13">13</a>] In turn, Aydinli defines the following categories of VNSAS: insurgents domestic
                                 militant groups, warlords, urban gangs, private militias/group, terrorists and criminal
                                 organizations. [<a href="#R14">14</a>] The author also defines the characteristics and evolutionary dynamics from those
                                 typologies of VNSAs, reinforcing their autonomy, representation and influence, and
                                 providing a comparative analysis of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e190">In according to Williams VNSAs are entities which challenge the state’s “monopoly
                                 on the use of violence within a specified geographical territory” ([<a href="#R12">12</a>] p. 4). VNSAs represent a departure from the traditional Westphalian system of states
                                 in two ways: first, by providing an alternative to state governance, and second, by
                                 challenging the state’s monopoly of violence. VNSAs develop out of poor state governance,
                                 but also contribute to further undermining governance by the state. A definition of
                                 VNSA, somewhat similar to that given by Williams, though calling those groups of non-state
                                 armed actors, is that from Robert Mandel ([<a href="#R15">15</a>] p. 42) that defines them like “[…] relatively autonomous organizations (not under
                                 complete and direct state control) with significant and sustained coercive capabilities
                                 for organized violence. Such actors have two additional features: non-integration
                                 into formalized state institutions and a degree of autonomy regarding politics, military
                                 operations, and resources” [<a href="#R16">16</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e201">Therefore, caution is required in the definition of black spots. In fact, they imply
                                 on the governance out of the state, like the non-state way of governance of VNSAs
                                 in a specific geographic region: “providing rudimentary forms of governance in urban
                                 [and rural] areas where the state is absent. The concept of ungoverned spaces is assumed
                                 because, where state is absent, there is no governance. In a few cases this might
                                 be true, but most so-called ungoverned spaces are, in reality, alternatively and/or
                                 hybrid governed spaces” ([<a href="#R12">12</a>] pp. 4 and 6).
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e206">VNSAs establish new patterns of governance: within this context, the governance standard
                                 setting is “no longer the exclusive domain of states or governments”. When weak states
                                 are unable to create or maintain the loyalty and allegiance of their populations,
                                 individuals and groups, those latter typically revert to, or develop, alternative
                                 patterns of affiliation [<a href="#R12">12</a>]. Moreover, where states with low capacity are unable to meet the demands of their
                                 citizens for security and other public goods, other actors fill the gap. New forms
                                 of governance or its overlap, carried out by VNSAs, are the result of the combination
                                 of different dimensions in a political-geographic space—the low presence of the state,
                                 ease in fundraising and control of VNSAs of strategic regions, questioning of the
                                 monopoly of force and coalitions and alliances between VNSAs.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e212">Our theoretical framework establishes a nexus between VNSAs and geographical scope,
                                 access to funding, resources, the role of violence, the interactions between VNSAs
                                 and state authorities. We focus on ‘governance beyond governments’, or even, informal
                                 modes of governance that emerge in spaces of limited state presence and operate ‘outside’
                                 government’s control. Starting from Williams (2008), the framework we employ to structure
                                 our case study combines several strands of literature reaching a mix of dimensions
                                 (access to funding, geographical scope, state presence, the role of violence). An
                                 overview of the potential determinants is presented in Figure <a href="#Fig1">1</a>. However, unlike Williams, we do not use a mix of dimensions “to understand the ways
                                 in which VNSAs differ from one another”. We use such structure of dimensions to identify
                                 how VNSAs develop an alternative governance on frontiers or how an alternative governance
                                 from the VNSAs overlap the fragile state governance, creating a hybrid governance
                                 [<a href="#R17">17</a>].

                              <p id="d1e220">Considering the ways through which they obtain financial support or access to resources,
                                 an analysis of the funding of VNSAs often requires a looking at their relationship
                                 with the illicit economy at national, regional and global levels. [<a href="#R13">13</a>] In some cases, funds are obtained through a model that resembles the provision of
                                 a private security service. In other cases, the form of financing and the relation
                                 with the form of financing react to the offensives of the central government. The
                                 VNSAs’ forms of funding may be connected directly to another VNSA (which serves as
                                 the source of the first) and based on opportunities, while keeping the focus on their
                                 armed struggle. It can include, in some cases, the protection of activities of the
                                 other group, by charging fees that allowed them to maintain their violent apparatus.

                              <p id="d1e225">As for the geostrategic positioning, some VNSAs are relatively small and operate in
                                 a circumscribed geographical area, while others have a wider transnational scope [<a href="#R13">13</a>]. Empirically it is important to state that the organization and coordination of
                                 criminal activities has increased in different parts of a region, spreading to other
                                 countries and showing their highest operability in border areas. Physical black spots
                                 might exist in part or all of a city or village, part or all of a province or country,

                                 is what distinguishes VNSAs from the NGOs and transnational advocacy networks, that
                                 are increasingly considered as part of global civil society. Different organizations
                                 not only use different levels and forms of violence, but also use it for different
                                 purposes. Finally, in what concerns the low state presence, the state’s minimal or
                                 utilitarian presence in these regions induces state agents, at certain moments, to
                                 favor the stockpiling, the protection and transit of drugs or illegal weapons in the

                                 to approximately 2,219 km, and also characterized by heavy economic and human flows,
                                 as well as licit and illicit activities. Illicit activities are carried out in this

                                 usually coexist with those licit border activities developed by the local population
                                 of both countries [<a href="#R18">18</a>]. In some cases, however, these black spots end up by giving no alternatives to the

                                 VNSAs on the frontier between Colombia and Venezuela was the National Liberation Army
                                 (ELN , <i>Ejército de Liberación Nacional</i>, in Spanish) [<a href="#R19">19</a>], with 31% of territorial presence in the border area, followed by the BACRIM [<a href="#R20">20</a>] (like the Usuga Clan, or <i>Clan Usuga</i>, in Spanish) [<a href="#R21">21</a>], the <i>Rastrojos</i> [<a href="#R22">22</a>] and the People’s Liberation Army (EPL, <i>Ejército Popular de Liberación</i>, in Spanish) with 24% of occupation, and finally by the smugglers, with 17%. Besides
                                 that, it was also possible to observe a certain equilibrium between the Revolutionary
                                 Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC, <i>Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia</i>, in Spanish) with 9% of territorial presence in the border area, before being demobilized
                                 in 2017 [<a href="#R23">23</a>], and BACRIM, which behaviour is similar to the one of neo-paramilitary groups [<a href="#R24">24</a>].

                                 of rural areas; and micro trafficking and murder by order in urban areas. In addition,
                                 BACRIM participate of the intermediate stages of the drug trafficking chain, such

                                 as well as the control of the micro trafficking of the domestic consumption ([<a href="#R02">2</a>], p. 424).

                                 actions. The result was a dispute between AUC and FARC in coca crop areas and territorial
                                 control over some distribution drug chains. However, some groups like AUC disappeared
                                 as organization, practically until 2006, because of the governmental demobilization
                                 programs undertaken by Uribe Government (2002-2010) in Colombia. However, aimed to
                                 fill the vacuum left by the AUC, a lot of members from that group were reorganized
                                 into other BACRIM such as <i>Los Rastrojos</i> and the <i>Usuga</i> Clan, which ascended to be a warehouse for smuggling and drug trafficking ([<a href="#R25">25</a>] p. 13).

                                       for the FARC in recent years, along with extortion and drug trafficking; while, historically,
                                       the main source of ELN funding is the kidnapping. [<a href="#R26">26</a>] The ELN “political kidnapping”, as they were called, served mainly to finance the
                                       organization itself, although some of them had the principal purpose of exchanging
                                       victims for guerrilla prisoners, and in this context, these actions seem very similar
                                       to the ones undertaken by the FARC in searching for a “humanitarian agreement”. Furthermore,
                                       the ELN has reactivated other sources of financing such as gasoline smuggling on the

                                       <i>Rastrojos</i> or the <i>Paisas</i>, in that they are uninterested in controlling the entire chain of drug production.
                                       But they have not proved themselves as adept as the <i>Rastrojos</i> when it comes to broker key alliances with other major players in the drug trade.
                                       The <i>Usuga</i> Clan bought coca base from the FARC, however the two groups are not collaborating
                                       much further than that. On the other hand, the main income sources of the <i>Rastrojos</i> come from the control of drug trafficking in Valle del Cauca, as well as other illegal
                                       activities in the region such as extortion, hired killers and drug micro-trafficking.

                                       phenomenon of the spread of VNSAs in the Venezuelan territory. According to the interviewed,

                                       forms of “taxes” (extortion). Moreover, according to the report, the region is also

                                       emerging. On one hand, VNSAs is controlling sources of financing arising from illicit
                                       activities. When small farmers or even groups of drug traffickers are required to

                                       charge, new forms of governance are created, that overlap those of the state. Moreover,
                                       as noted by Bruce Bagley, it is observable that VNSAs can generate illicit drug markets,
                                       and illicit activities “because it keeps moving throughout the borders, running from
                                       local authorities and from their military actions” [<a href="#R32">32</a>].

                                    <p id="d1e385">On the other hand, and principally consistent with Williams framework, these groups
                                       get funding in an economy that varies significantly among national, regional and global
                                       scale. At the national level, although they participate in different informal and
                                       illegal drug, mining and smuggling markets, these VNSAs also obtain resources through
                                       the provision of “private” security services to local communities or even national
                                       groups, or sometimes even through the receiving of money from local criminal groups’
                                       “franchises”[<a href="#R33">33</a>]. The growing specialization of the different groups in the control of criminal economies
                                       spread throughout the national territory. The groups favor a networked control of
                                       illicit economies, outsourcing some parts of these activities to other smaller unities:

                                    <p id="d1e390">It is noteworthy how it can be highly lucrative to participate in crossings precisely
                                       where they are illegal; when states define certain activities as illegal, they create
                                       a risk premium for undertaking the activity. The opportunity for increased gain naturally
                                       leads actors engage both legal and illegal transactions to seek to influence the politics
                                       of border control, and thus rules governing economic exchanges [<a href="#R05">5</a>].

                                    <p id="d1e395">At the regional level, groups such as BACRIM participate in the chain-of-trade of
                                       regional drug traffickers or by charging “tolls” to facilitate the outbound routes
                                       to Central America and the Northern market or even through direct marketing of drugs
                                       with Mexican drug cartels. Globally speaking, they have become key drug brokers, in
                                       the Colombian Pacific and the Venezuelan Caribbean Sea of lots of illicit drugs that
                                       are sent to European, American or Asian markets.

                                    <p id="d1e397">Then, low state regulation, corruption, high levels of violence and self-financing
                                       possibilities for the VNSAs may indicate, in the case of the Colombian border with
                                       Venezuela, the rupture of the institutional environment. Furthermore, this may also
                                       contribute to generate alternative and informal forms of governance that can survive
                                       or even emerge in the absence of the state or with partial statehood. Such reality
                                       is observed by Frödin mainly in the Americas, where some spaces are governed by alternative
                                       forms of power, based on “law of the strongest”, and where relations are based on
                                       personal standards, as well as on bonds of trust and fear ([<a href="#R34">34</a>], p. 274). They are internally fragmented countries, with serious failures of formal
                                       governance, where informal institutions end up occupying the vacuum of power left
                                       by the central authority and leading to hybrid ways of governance.

                                    <p id="d1e405">Given the geostrategic position, some VNSAs are relatively small and operate in a
                                       circumscribed geographical area, while others have a wider transnational scope [<a href="#R13">13</a>]. Empirically, it is important to state that there was an increase in the organization
                                       and coordination of criminal activities in different parts of a region and that those
                                       activities have overlapped other countries. Therefore, it results that these groups
                                       are highly operatives in border areas ([<a href="#R35">35</a>] p. 24).

                                    <p id="d1e413">In their search for profits, VNSAs would accept a higher risk to get a convenient
                                       geographical base, as well as proximity to the global marketplace. A strategic region
                                       for these groups is represented by the frontiers of many weak states; in fact, border
                                       regions possesses geographical, political, economic and social features, like low
                                       institutional presence of the state, strategic position, necessary infrastructure
                                       and a minimal and utilitarian presence of governments agents, that transform this
                                       area in an operational refuge for VNSAs.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e415">The VNSAs are present in all the places of the border between Colombia and Venezuela,
                                       leaving no border department free from their presence. According to the data, it seems
                                       important to note that the Colombian border region with the biggest incidence of VNSAs
                                       (with 44% of presence) is Norte Santander department (borders with the Venezuelan
                                       department of Táchira). This department is in fact the most populated and urbanized
                                       one, compared to Guajira (borders with the Venezuelan department of Zulia) and Arauca
                                       (borders with the Venezuelan department of Apure). Táchira and Zulia represent 58%
                                       of the incidence of VNSAs in the frontier region between both countries (see Figure
                                       <a href="#Fig3">3</a>).

                                    <p id="d1e420">Therefore, Venezuela’s strategic location is crucial for the profit calculations and
                                       interests of illegal armed groups, as the country has 4,000 km of maritime border
                                       with the Caribbean and 185 km with the Atlantic Ocean, and a series of ports along
                                       the coast, as Maracaibo, La Guairá and Puerto Cabello, from which illicit trafficking
                                       can be disposed of both in Central America and in Europe ([<a href="#R36">36</a>] p. 9). Ariel Ávila has shown that some “neo-paramilitary”—or BACRIM groups—were
                                       allocated in the region, forming, according to the author, a “criminal structure”
                                       of charges against drug traffickers and extortion of civilians.

                                    <p id="d1e425">Furthermore, if we consider the dimension of geostrategic geographical position and
                                       the scope, this latter took place through an intense work of agreements and alliances
                                       and the building up of societies with diverse structures of organized crime at a local
                                       and regional level, seeking to dominate the whole chain of the drug trafficking business
                                       and other illicit activities, like smuggling. Analyzing the agreements contracted
                                       between VNSAs, in the Colombian border regions with Ecuador, Annette Idler points
                                       out that: in reality, the categories are very fluid and flexible, and the lines between
                                       the different types of arrangement that exists between one or more groups with another
                                       or other groups can evolve into another one, meaning: spot sales may evolve into a
                                       strategic alliance ([<a href="#R04">4</a>] pp. 68–69).

                                    <p id="d1e430">Finally, in the understanding of the key geographical spaces occupied by VNSAs it
                                       is also important to consider the transnational links of the BACRIM with other criminal
                                       groups outside the country. Of the three main BACRIM, two of them, the <i>Usuga</i> Clan and the ELP, have maintained transnational business networks with the Mexican
                                       Cartel of Sinaloa, one of the two most powerful Mexican drug trafficking organizations.
                                       On the other hand, official sources detected that the Sinaloa Cartel was financing
                                       those BACRIM engaged in robbery, while the Cartel was also working for the largest
                                       criminal organization in Colombia, the <i>Usuga</i> Clan. [<a href="#R37">37</a>]. For Clunan and Trinkunas to the extent that VNSAs are present in a certain space,
                                       then they generate: (i) disorder, with the use of force in a systematic way; (ii)
                                       contested spaces, with the formation of rules, norms and the generation of an own
                                       authority; these spaces may begin to generate insecurity, especially if they overflow
                                       to a border country or if in that space proliferate activities related to transnational
                                       crime ([<a href="#R03">3</a>] p. 26).

                                       was a decrease in the efficiency and presence of the Colombian state in the border
                                       departments with Venezuela, resulting in a zero-sum outcome that erased the progress
                                       made in the item “effectiveness”, which had improved in all departments bordering
                                       Venezuela, as reported in the Table <a href="#Tab1">1</a>. In addition, the data show that the presence of the Colombian state has generally
                                       failed to be strong in those departments, with the exception, and a slight improvement,
                                       in the North of Santander. There was, on the other hand, a good improvement in the
                                       rates of Guajira. Meanwhile, both Arauca and Cesar Departments presented a slight
                                       worsening in the rates of the Colombian state’s presence, at the same period. It can
                                       be argued that the departments (except the Arauca department that was absent) witnessed
                                       increasing rates of unemployment, ranging from 9% to 12%, and medium and high GINI

                                       the security field, when people at the border area accept the idea that security,
                                       which in thesis should be offered by the State, exists in part because groups like
                                       BRACRIM have imposed that, in any way. As reported by the testimony of an inhabitant
                                       of the region: “You can leave the door open because you know that if you act badly
                                       they will kill you. It’s like a mentality; if you do something bad, like stealing
                                       or fighting, an armed guy will come and kill you” [<a href="#R34">34</a>]. “With the exception of the occasional motorized patrol of heavily armed police,
                                       the state—and the right—is completely absent. Similarly, they are also absent in many

                                       conflicts, drug trafficking, racial, political, or social extermination projects”

                                    <p id="d1e810">The analysis of the low statehood at the Colombia and Venezuela border has become
                                       important because of the centrality of this space for a series of activities that
                                       have begun to overlap and, therefore, to turn out the area into multimodal transit
                                       zone, allowing for outlawed groups to carry out activities such as trafficking, stockpiling
                                       and hiding products, money laundering, weapons buying, among others. But on the other
                                       hand, these illicit activities have ended up generating a series of unlawful “public
                                       goods”— labor markets, security that is not offered by the state and supply of goods
                                       and consumer products. Moreover, facing the displacement of trade, either by outlaw
                                       groups, illicit flow and civilians affected by conflict, borders became a suitable
                                       locus for refuge, support and transit of those actors. The illegal transit that has
                                       been occurring in the border area between Colombia and Venezuela, namely drug and
                                       arms trafficking, as well as the use of the region as a refuge by unlawful armed groups—like
                                       the ELN and BACRIM— are real “black spots”, in which the presence of the state is
                                       weak related to the formulation of public policy and effective appropriation of space.

                                    <p id="d1e812">According to Avila , there are regions in which different forms of illegal authorities
                                       operate, with the rise of a political elite linked to crime and the presence of territorial
                                       disputes over drug trafficking routes to the guerrilla groups This increased pressure
                                       in the border area, says Avila, is due mainly to the disposal of police officers from
                                       both nationalities, in coalition with drug traffickers, which can lead to increasing
                                       tension between these countries. So, the scholar highlights three trends that have
                                       intensified the problem of the region: i) collaboration or negligence of local official
                                       agents; ii) inability of governance in the region; iii) increasing institutional instability
                                       of local and regional administrations in the border zone [<a href="#R06">6</a>].

                                    <p id="d1e817">Hence, a key question is the extent to which the VNSAs has become an alternative form
                                       of governance and is fulfilling functions that normally are of the responsibility
                                       of the state, such as health, safety, infrastructure construction and urban sanitation.
                                       Thus, it is important to determine what kind of capacity gaps and functional holes
                                       are filled by VNSAs. So, these can include the provision of state functions, like
                                       the imposing and maintaining of security and order, while they can also extend to
                                       what might be described as paternalistic forms of social welfare. Indeed, for VNSAs
                                       the filling of functional spaces is often even more important than filling territorial
                                       spaces ([<a href="#R17">17</a>] p. 8). This indicates that when VNSAS establish themselves on a frontier, the most
                                       important thing for them is not to dominate the territory of that border through armed
                                       means or establishing forms of authority in that territory, but it results to be more
                                       effective whether they are able to gain a certain social legitimacy by filling the
                                       functions that the state does not provide such as safety, health and job creation.
                                       The governance failure by the central authorities of the states ends up generating
                                       small “black spots” usually located in neighborhoods where the police does not enter
                                       and therefore creating parallel ends to formal social norms.

                                    <p id="d1e825">Smugglers and narcotraffickers have also used the protection offered by BACRIM, which
                                       gradually became more present on the border between Colombia and Venezuela, after
                                       the 2000s. In the same period, the increased number of paramilitary groups in the
                                       region, sharing an area that was witnessing an augmenting of illegal practices of
                                       narcotrafficking and smuggling, resulted in many aggressive disputes, among which,
                                       the most violent one was the Bahia Portete massacre, in 2004, against the indigenous
                                       women from the Wayúu community. Paramilitary groups, in particular the Jorge 40, profited
                                       from the internal disputes inside the Wayúu community to attack its women, that were
                                       ravished, tortured and most of them disappeared. This massacre, other than clearly
                                       demonstrate the violent disputes in the region, is significant to highlight the cruel
                                       fact that the vulnerable groups, and in this specific case we are talking of a double
                                       vulnerable group (indigenous and women), are the first and the most affected targets
                                       of violence [<a href="#R78">78</a>].

                                    <p id="d1e830">Violence assumes different forms in the border region and its use is also related
                                       to the high incidence of activities exerted by the different types of VNSAs, like
                                       kidnappings, extortion, deaths, among others. Regarding the data on security and violence,
                                       it can be observed that homicide rates in Norte Santander department are higher than
                                       the national and regional average; furthermore, kidnapping rates in the departments
                                       of Arauca are four times higher than the national average (Table <a href="#Tab2">2</a>). It should be highlighted that the Arauca department is one of the main sources
                                       of funding for some VNSAs, like the ELN. Moreover, the hectares of coca planted in
                                       the Department of Santander are also four times higher than the national average.
                                       On the other hand, in the Colombian side, the regions La Guajira and Cúcuta are the

                                    <p id="d1e835">According to the project “Rutas del conflicto” from <i>Centro Nacional de Memoria Histórica de Colombia</i> (Routes of the conflict—National Center of Historical Memory of Colombia), between
                                       1982 and 2013, the BACRIM or neoparamilitaries were responsible for the vast majority
                                       of deaths in Colombia, committing a total number of 1,166 massacres. They were followed
                                       by unidentified armed groups with 295 massacres, the FARC guerrilla with 238 cases,
                                       and 139 massacres were committed by the security forces [<a href="#R79">79</a>].

                                    <p id="d1e843">According to statistics, 6,729 people were abducted by the ELN, which is heavily concentrated
                                       on the Colombian border with Venezuela, especially in the departments of Norte Santander
                                       (Colombia) and Apure (Venezuela), between 1985 and 2015. Of these people, 148 would
                                       have died in captivity. In addition, more recent data showed that the FARC has appeared
                                       until its demobilization as the alleged perpetrator in 33% of the cases while it has
                                       been confirmed in 37% of them; the BACRIM has obtained a percentage of 27% and 20%
                                       respectively; while the ELN scores 25% cases as presumed author and 30% as confirmed.
                                       In addition, data from the <i>Pais Libre Foundation</i> indicates that, in a historical series between 1996 and 2008, the sum of kidnappings
                                       in the departments of the border between Colombia and Venezuela (Guajira, Cesar, Norte
                                       de Santander, Boyacá, Arauca, Vichada and Guainía) was the largest number of all the
                                       border areas of Colombia, with a total of 5,786 people kidnapped [<a href="#R31">31</a>].

                                    <p id="d1e851">Finally, when the VNSAs action comes to the dimension of violence it is also admitting
                                       that VNSAs have achieved some degrees of autonomy and can exercise those governance
                                       functions that are not provided by the state. The local population has often been
                                       forced to move, either internally or to neighboring territories, and when the state
                                       can not exercise its authority effectively, it delegates violence to other actors,
                                       allowing for the emergence of the neo-paramilitary groups. Some officers have pointed
                                       out that the state, by recognizing its deficiencies, has allowed the use of weapons
                                       by peasants to defend themselves and sometimes to attack guerrilla members. [<a href="#R80">80</a>] This means that sometimes the state empowers social actors of the population with
                                       violence functions. It is an attitude that should be avoided both because the state
                                       does not have the capacity to control the use of means of violence by the population
                                       and also because the states is easily opting for delegating to the population the
                                       fight against VNSAS and consequently affecting the state’s monopoly of force. [<a href="#R37">37</a>] VNSAs are inherently “illegitimate <i>vis-à-vis</i> the classical state system in part because the essence of being a state is having
                                       a monopoly on the legitimate use of violence. Yet, they often provide alternative
                                       governance, offering services and supplying collective goods that the state is unable
                                       or unwilling to offer and provide” ([<a href="#R12">12</a>] p. 6).

                              <p id="d1e1058">The case of the Colombian and Venezuelan borders shows that within this context, the
                                 governance standard setting is “no longer the exclusive domain of states or governments”
                                 ([<a href="#R81">81</a>] p. 11). A diversity of actors, such as rebels and neoparamilitaries can now communicate
                                 more effectively and disseminate new standards of governance. Some of the Colombian
                                 and Venezuelan borders can be defined like black spots, but in line with the theoretical
                                 development it doesn’t mean that they are non-governed areas, on the contrary, they
                                 are not completely governed by the state or that such areas show limited statehood.
                                 The governance out the state, like the one coming from criminal groups of insurgents,
                                 is a way to check the absence of the state in one specific geographic region and show
                                 that VNSAs are certainly able, at least, to “provide rudimentary forms of governance
                                 in urban [and rural] areas where the state is absent” ([<a href="#R17">17</a>] p. 4).
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e1066">Black spots can appear, such as the data have shown, both in more developed urban
                                 region, like the Departments of Santander and Táchira (in Colombia and Venezuela,
                                 respectively), as well as in a less developed region in the rural areas along the
                                 Arauca Department borders. Moreover these black spots can present many possibilities
                                 of dimensions—from funding until violence. Such a territorial coverage of the VNSAS
                                 is explained by the fact that the state’s presence with its public policies is not
                                 homogeneous, meaning with this that, in many urbanized and populated regions as well
                                 as in rural regions, some areas are less provided by state assistance and less served
                                 by public policies.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e1068">This could lead to the question whether the state is interested to be present in such
                                 regions, or whether it is convenient for it to leave poor areas under the control
                                 of VNSAs. In fact, it is possible to advance the hypothesis that it may be opportune
                                 for the state, for electoral reasons, to justify the implementation of repressive
                                 policies of public security, or even because the VNSAs acting in the black spots provide
                                 “public goods” for the population—security, food, fuel, medicines, among others—that
                                 the national government is unable to provide. On the other hand, it is possible to
                                 observe black spots, on Colombia and Venezuela borders, in which the presence of VNSAs
                                 makes the social institutional governance dependent on the income generated by illicit
                                 economies, implying alternative modes of subordination to illegal actors. In fact,
                                 if the population and entrepreneurs’ levels of consumption depend on the illegal income,
                                 then their subordination to illegal actors is complete and and repressive state governance
                                 policy, to combat organized crime in these territories, may not be feasible [<a href="#R82">82</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e1073">Where there is a functional absence of the state, informal economy and low social
                                 security conditions, the practice of crimes is favored. Sometimes, as in the case
                                 of Venezuela, even when the regulatory presence of the state exist—through members
                                 of the armed forces—the corruption of officers leads to a spillover effect towards
                                 other societies, leading to violence and corrupt practices. In other words, the penetration
                                 of official institutions, which in principle should combat illicit activities, is
                                 not limited to the border, but gradually problems such as corruption, violence and
                                 drug trafficking are spreading even into the territory of the neighboring country.
