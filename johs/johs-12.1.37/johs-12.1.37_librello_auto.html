                              areas do not have enough income to survive decently. The struggle to access land should
                              lead to a paradigm shift with social movements leading this process since democratization.
                              Their strategies vary, but usually focus on complementary activities of mass mobilization
                              that culminate in the occupation of unproductive land that is not fulfilling its social
                              function in order to force expropriation and the creation of new settlements. This
                              study aims to investigate, through empirical evidence, if such strategies are having
                              the desired effect of allowing the poor to access land, without increasing the already
                              high numbers, and potentially aggravating the violent characteristics, of such disputes.
                              During the Cardoso and Lula presidential administrations the relation between the
                              number of new settlements and the number of deaths caused by land disputes increased.
                              However, there is still a long way to go to improve this policy and achieve positive
                              results. Overall, is this struggle for the reduction of inequality in the Brazilian
                              countryside being won? Is the sacrifice paying off? And what is the price regarding
                              the relation between land conflict victims and the creation of new rural settlements?

                              <p id="d1e77">Brazil has vast dimensions, fertile land and climate conditions that are favorable
                                 for agricultural activity. Hence, in 2012, the country ranked third among the world’s
                                 largest exporters of agricultural products ([<a href="#R01">1</a>] p. 2) . Given these natural attributes, it is hard to conceive that this abundance
                                 would lead to violence caused by land disputes, since well-distributed land among
                                 the peasant population would contribute to rural inhabitants deriving their livelihoods
                                 from the land. The main problem is that the land is extremely unequally distributed:
                                 1% of landowners occupy about 50% of arable lands [<a href="#R02">2</a>], which is one of the highest rates of land concentration in the world. With the
                                 expansion of agribusiness and human and animal food crops being replaced by renewable
                                 energy crops, land concentration worldwide is growing, and tends to grow even more,
                                 in countries with a Brazilian or Latin American profile [<a href="#R03">3</a>, <a href="#R04">4</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e91">Land in Brazil is an abundant natural resource though very unequally distributed and,
                                 as such, part of the existing literature discusses the association between abundant
                                 natural resources and violent conflicts, especially as a cause for civil wars [<a href="#R05">5</a>, <a href="#R06">6</a>, <a href="#R07">7</a>, <a href="#R08">8</a>, <a href="#R09">9</a>, <a href="#R10">10</a>] and other episodes of violence.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e112">However, there are not many studies relating natural resources in general, and land
                                 in particular, to lower-intensity conflicts that also cause a great number of deaths,
                                 as well as forced displacement, arrests, injuries, threats and the like.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e114">In existing studies, the type of political regime is often included in models as one
                                 of the variables that can lead to the insurgency of collective violence; violent conflicts
                                 have a greater tendency to happen within <i>anocratic</i> [<a href="#R11">11</a>] (or hybrid/intermediate) political regimes. These regimes are known for being a
                                 middle ground between a consolidated democracy and an autocracy, mixing democratic
                                 and autocratic elements in which the population does not have freedom and the heterogeneity
                                 of groups is not respected. On the extreme, civil and political liberties are violated
                                 and protests are strongly suppressed [<a href="#R12">12</a>, <a href="#R13">13</a>, <a href="#R14">14</a>, <a href="#R15">15</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e135">Since democratization in 1985, due to the country’s abundance of natural resources,
                                 particularly land (the theme this study aims at addressing), and the very little time
                                 the country has had to strengthen its institutions, Brazil has gone through agrarian
                                 conflicts caused by the historically unequal distribution of land, which in turn produces
                                 poverty and misery in the countryside. About 1,500 people have died since the country’s
                                 democratic opening as a result of the struggle for land; the great majority of deaths
                                 occurring among the peasants or their supporters [<a href="#R16">16</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e140">This study aims to evaluate the cost of human lives that derives from land dispute
                                 conflicts in Brazil, analyzing if social movements and non-governmental organizations
                                 that mobilize the rural (and urban) population to fight for fairer land distribution,
                                 and consequently reduce poverty, achieve the desired effect. That is, if the means
                                 applied to acquire a plot of land for the poorer rural population is producing the
                                 practical outcome of a more equitable land division.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e142">For this purpose, a new database from DATALUTA will be examined on the different types
                                 of peasant mobilization, land appropriations and settlements implemented in Brazil
                                 between 1988 and 2011. 1988 marks the year of the new Federal Constitution. Article
                                 186 of this most recent constitution requires proof that the land fulfills its social
                                 function and is not unproductive in order for it not to be destined to expropriation
                                 and distribution to very small owners or landless peasants. Data on agrarian violence
                                 will also be presented, with the aim of clarifying the number of people that have
                                 died in the struggle for land, the mobilization activities that third sector entities
                                 implement to keep this struggle alive, and the number of people that have been settled.
                                 In short, is this fight being won? Or furthermore: Is this fight paying off in terms
                                 of the ratio of <i>victims of land conflicts to settlements created</i>?

                              <p id="d1e150">One of the Brazilian military government’s goals in 1964 was to develop the country’s
                                 agriculture. Shortly after the military coup, during the military government’s first
                                 year, the Land Statute (Estatuto de Terra) was created. This document emerged with
                                 the purpose to reduce conflicts over land and to prevent communism from spreading
                                 across the country and, amid the Cold War, counted on support from the US, especially
                                 after it had ‘lost Cuba’ to the Soviet sphere of influence. One way to accomplish
                                 this was to facilitate credit and give vast areas of land to large companies that
                                 had no expertise in the field, since they were from the automotive industry, financial
                                 markets, and other fields unfamiliar to the agricultural sector [<a href="#R17">17</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e155">People raced to areas where they believed to be vast tracts of unowned land. At the
                                 time, the motto was “Land without men for men without land”. However, a great part
                                 of the area that seemed unoccupied had been donated or financed at very low interest
                                 rates to companies who did not cultivate the lands, especially in the Amazon region,
                                 in the northern part of the country. Rural workers arrived in search of land and occupied
                                 already owned areas. However, the region did not have the necessary infrastructure
                                 to transport agricultural products, and the newly arrived workers were vulnerable

                              <p id="d1e167">The democratization process in Brazil began in 1985 with the downfall of the military
                                 regime and was consolidated in 1990, with the country’s first free and universal presidential
                                 elections. Concurrently, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the third sector
                                 were allowed to represent the different sectors of the population. Consequently, individuals
                                 and groups, particularly in the poorer segments that had no representation in parliament
                                 or in civil society as a whole, received assistance and were no longer suppressed.
                                 <i>Citizenship</i> was being built. Such organizations and social movements mobilized peasants in order
                                 to pressure government representatives to undertake a land reform that would decentralize
                                 land tenure. There was heavy opposition from groups of large landowners who wanted
                                 to preserve the <i>status quo</i> (the Ruralist Democratic Union, known by its Portuguese acronym as UDN). Such groups
                                 were well organized and exerted significant influence on congress. In 1987, the president
                                 of the UDN admitted his organization had bought 4,000 guns and had 70,000 firearms
                                 at the group’s disposal ([<a href="#R19">19</a>] p. 30) for protection against occupation of the members’ private property.

                              <p id="d1e178">The agrarian issue is embroiled in violence because, on the one hand, peasants want
                                 to take over land that is supposedly owned by third parties or the State and, on the
                                 other, landowners (or presumed owners) try to protect their territory from occupants
                                 by hiring gunmen or the police. Meanwhile, the State withdraws itself by not defining
                                 a clear policy to appropriate land and redistributes it to the poor living in rural
                                 areas. This is of utter importance considering that three out of every four of the
                                 world’s poor live in rural areas ([<a href="#R20">20</a>] p. 36). Agrarian reform should be no less than a social policy to combat poverty
                                 where it is mostly concentrated: in rural areas. By alleviating rural poverty, the
                                 country would strengthen itself. One of the main problems in Brazil is that the State
                                 lacks the capability to carry out a substantial agrarian reform. Moreover, pro-market
                                 considerations disregard productive land as land to be included in the reform ([<a href="#R21">21</a>] p. 221). The agribusiness sector is very important for balancing accounts given
                                 that commodity exports are a major source of foreign currency for the country. As
                                 observed, even workers’ political representatives when in power, tend to support agribusiness
                                 at the expense of land reform, and Brazil is no exception.

                              <p id="d1e186">Land occupation and its retaliation is a unique process that must be understood as
                                 a practice based on political context and performed as collective action ([<a href="#R22">22</a>] p. 169) from both sides: those who occupy the land and those who defend it from
                                 occupation. The difference between these two forces is that those who occupy do not
                                 do it to practice violence against third parties, in the direct sense of physically
                                 victimizing people. However, retaliation of these occupations is frequently performed
                                 with the intent to cause physical harm to the activists.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e191">There is also a legal problem. The occupation of unproductive land, as mentioned above,
                                 can be legally justified through the Constitution, and the defense of public property
                                 is in accordance with the Brazilian Civil Code. While the National Institute of Colonization
                                 and Agrarian Reform (INCRA) defends the peasants, justice courts often favor the owners.
                                 None of these institutions prevail over each other, thus, land dispute conflicts continue
                                 ([<a href="#R23">23</a>] p. 137). The current model incentivizes both sides of the conflict to use violence,
                                 taking into consideration that one side has weapons at its disposal, while the other
                                 is formed by an unarmed and poor population willing to revert the long standing land
                                 inequality scenario that persists among these divergent actors.

                                 unions aiming greater opportunities for access to land. Landless workers and smallholder
                                 farmers with small areas of land for subsistence pressure the government through local

                              <p id="d1e201">There is a sense of urgency for the State to intervene when a peasant group, affiliated
                                 to a rural social movement or union, occupies (or threatens to occupy) an area that
                                 is supposedly unproductive and belongs to another owner, so that violence does not
                                 get out of control. In this case, the area is evaluated to ensure it is unproductive
                                 (usually the peasant leadership has already done this to map the possible targets)
                                 and begin the expropriation process (usually through compensation), which can take
                                 months or even years, depending on procedural progress. During this time, the territory
                                 is referred to as a land occupation. Upon approval and completion of the process,
                                 the land becomes a settlement. Nonetheless, there are many problems entailed, such
                                 as lack of infrastructure, lack of housing, reduced financial loans, shortage of technical
                                 assistance, distance from towns, and susceptibility to diseases. The new settled owners
                                 receive their titles and formally own their plots, and can even sell them if they
                                 so desire. However, in such cases, they won’t be allowed to participate in a future
                                 land reform and this can generate conflicts within the social movements, since the
                                 fight for land is not aimed at obtaining financial gains, but survival and a life
                                 with dignity.

                                 the purposes of those interested in getting a piece of land through agrarian reform.
                                 This occurred in Brazil. The intensification of the protests in 1995 and 1996, followed
                                 by repression, created a situation in which it was possible for the population to

                                 the scope of land distribution [<a href="#R25">25</a>]. The State’s violence probably favored the creation of more rural settlements. The
                                 question is to what extent does the cost in lives encourage the State to take action
                                 to implement the necessary policies?

                              <p id="d1e244">The Rural Landless Workers Movement, known as MST (from the Portuguese acronym for
                                 <i>Movimento dos Trabalhadores Rurais Sem Terra</i>), was formed after the Catholic Church installed the Pastoral Land Commission, CPT
                                 (from the Portuguese acronym for <i>Comissão Pastoral da Terra</i>), during the military regime in 1975, to counteract a specific modernization policy
                                 which consisted in granting large tracts of land to the various companies from different
                                 economic sectors so that they could transform what was understood as a development
                                 lag into a very effective agricultural sector. After acting in conjunction with CPT
                                 for some time, the Movement gained autonomy and started to operate independently,
                                 although there were some areas in which they held similar interests and actions.

                              <p id="d1e252">The modernization of agriculture, as proposed by the government, ignored peasants
                                 and gave capitalist companies the main role in modernizing and developing Brazil’s
                                 countryside. CPT’s main task was to organize peasants’ movements that emerged during
                                 the military regime ([<a href="#R29">29</a>] p. 10). The State’s oppression was directed against those social movements such
                                 as the MST, which was first organized in 1978 after occupying a farm in the state
                                 of Rio Grande do Sul, with 110 families [<a href="#R30">30</a>]. In time the MST expanded its objectives and included the restoration of the democratic
                                 rule in the country and the pursuit for representation in Congress - certainly an
                                 innovative path for dispossessed people in Brazil, who had never been politically
                                 represented. Within a decade, the movement had turned very popular among peasants
                                 and gained growing support from urban sectors as well, particularly in universities
                                 and other NGOs.

                              <p id="d1e260">Land occupations were adopted as the movement’s main form of action, but additional
                                 strategies for striving for a piece of land were also included in its operation. According
                                 to Fernandes [<a href="#R29">29</a>], MST’s formation consisted of three different periods: Creation (1978–1985), mainly
                                 in the South and South-East of Brazil, occupying land from latifundia and large corporations;
                                 Consolidation (1985–1990) spreading across the country and building its organizational
                                 structure; and Institutionalization (1990s) when the movement intensified the peasantry’s
                                 resistance actions, dealing with a very repressive State apparatus while occupying
                                 land ([<a href="#R29">29</a>] pp. 11–12).

                              <p id="d1e268">An additional difference between the members of the MST in relation to other movements
                                 of landless workers is their high quality of life, as demonstrated by a national spectrum
                                 research conducted by government bodies such as the Ministry of Agrarian Development
                                 (MDA) and INCRA. The reason is the MST’s organizational structure, in which its affiliates
                                 need to get involved and are expected to commit to participatory education that is
                                 run according to the Movement’s goals. The results of this national survey indicated
                                 that MST landless workers are considered to have a higher self-perceived social status
                                 in relation to other movements, taking into account social justice, racial democracy
                                 and humanitarian values [<a href="#R31">31</a>]. Despite its ideological education for its rural communities, the MST is also perceived
                                 as an organization that prepares and educates children and adults with the basic elements
                                 for being full citizens and that demands public services from the authorities. Certainly,
                                 these features help the Movement gain more support and to rank it as one of the largest
                                 in Latin America.

                              <p id="d1e273">The National Confederation of Agricultural Workers, CONTAG (<i>Confederação Nacional dos Trabalhadores na Agricultura</i>), was created in 1963 and is the official rural workers union [<a href="#R32">32</a>]. This form of rural unionism defined its actions, which are aimed at defending labor
                                 rights in various areas. It is a less ideological movement than the MST.

                              <p id="d1e281">Nonetheless, during the military period, the regime’s opposition, represented by other
                                 social movements saw CONTAG skeptically and NGOS criticized the Confederation at that
                                 time. The rural department of the Unified Worker’s Central, CUT (<i>Central Única dos Trabalhadores</i>), criticized CONTAG for being submissive, legalistic, and for not solving the problems
                                 of small farmers. Since its origin, CUT’s rural department stated its intention to
                                 form an alternative union, opposed to CONTAG, closer to the grassroots, less bureaucratic
                                 and more combative in defending the interests of farmers ([<a href="#R33">33</a>] p. 4). Nevertheless, CUT and CONTAG joined forces in 1995, but split up in the late
                                 ’90s due to disagreements.

                                    CONTAG rented eight large tents to receive the protesters. A security company was

                                    to marches and public events. Both movements, however, have the option for land invasions

                                 the role of modernization in agriculture. Even the Brazilian government during the
                                 military regime intended to modernize agriculture but with a completely different
                                 approach than that aspired by certain social movements such as the MST. While the
                                 military regime focused on the large capitalist conglomerates as central actors in
                                 this process of modernization, the MST had a more ideological and clear political
                                 view in this regard. Its objectives are to combat the commodification of land reform,
                                 fight agribusiness and transnational companies because these want to control seeds,
                                 production and agricultural trade, besides keeping workers in the field under labor
                                 conditions analogous to slavery and other forms of subordination. MST proposes that
                                 agriculture be focused on the domestic market, that it respect the environment and
                                 encourages the agricultural cooperation and autonomy of workers [<a href="#R36">36</a>].

                              <p id="d1e325">Nevertheless, the two largest groups defending peasants (MST and CONTAG) have common
                                 goals such as (a) the expropriation of all land holdings belonging to foreign capital
                                 and banks; (b) the expropriation of land in which ‘modern slavery’ is used; (c) both
                                 strive for the demarcation of all the lands of indigenous and quilombo communities
                                 [<a href="#R36">36</a>]; and (d) both have national penetration and their members are scattered around the
                                 country, unlike most regional agrarian movements.

                                 of access to land faced by a great number of peasants. Among these participatory strategies
                                 are: camping in relevant localities; solidarity actions; petitions in favor of the
                                 cause; hearings with authorities; road blockages; registration of interested parties;
                                 marches; religious celebrations; siege of construction sites; concentration in public
                                 spaces; meetings; strikes (including hunger and thirst strikes); access bans; manifestos;
                                 task forces; occupation of bank branches; occupation of public and private buildings;
                                 leafleting; vehicle retentions; pilgrimages; looting; thematic demonstrations; vigils;
                                 among others.

                              <p id="d1e400">The amount of participants involved reflects the relative level of impact and media
                                 coverage these activities receive. Consequently, there is a greater possibility for
                                 a favorable public opinion towards land redistribution. Therefore, not only potential
                                 beneficiaries, but urban supporters also can (and actually do) join the masses in
                                 these events. Many times these activities take place in large urban centers to form
                                 public opinion and mobilize supporters other than those directly involved in the struggle
                                 for land. Scholars, students and union workers are some of the potential targets to
                                 raise support and serve as a force in forming public opinion and pressuring decision
                                 makers on issues related to agrarian reform and land redistribution. The media’s approach
                                 and coverage also plays a relevant role in mass mobilizations.

                              <p id="d1e402">As shown in Table <a href="#Tab02">2</a>, in the twelve-year period (2000–2011) analyzed, over five million people participated
                                 in these mobilization activities as a strategy to pressure decision makers. This number
                                 does not include those who were not registered or counted, which would potentially
                                 increase the total figure. Also, people can participate in more than one kind of activity.
                                 Therefore, the final number should be interpreted not as the total number of different
                                 people involved in actions, but the total number of overall participants. The most
                                 popular activities that mobilized a substantial number of participants were: pilgrimages;
                                 concentration in public spaces; road blockages; thematic demonstrations; marches;
                                 camps; and walks.

                                 (43%). This movement is exceptional at mobilizing rural workers. Supporters of their
                                 cause tend to organize on the national and international levels—the MST provides training
                                 to Latin American peasants and exchanges knowledge with different organizations in
                                 the field, such as the Bolivian MST and La Via Campesina. The CPT is one of the most
                                 important entities that support the struggle for land distribution, mobilizes peasants,
                                 and also provides legal and social assistance. The CPT participated in 935 mobilization
                                 activities; the Brazilian Movement of People Affected by Dams (MAB) participated in
                                 446 mobilizations; the Rural Workers’ Union (STR) took part in 291 activities; the
                                 Federation of Agricultural Workers (FETAGRI) participated in 210 activities; and the
                                 Confederation of Agricultural Workers (CONTAG), in 109 mobilizations. Contrary to
                                 the occupations’ figures, CONTAG had a much more restrained participation. It is important
                                 to note that several of these actions were jointly organized by more than one of these
                                 entities.

                                 are cyclical. On presidential election years (2002, 2006 and 2010) in which a candidate
                                 from the Workers Party (PT) had real chances of winning (and in fact, they won all
                                 three elections: Lula won in 2002 and 2006, and Dilma Rousseff won in 2010) [<a href="#R38">38</a>], there was a significant reduction in activities. The exception was 2010, with a
                                 slight increase in the number of demonstrations and participants. This was probably
                                 to the benefit of the PT candidate and did not influence negatively the party’s support
                                 given it has the most affinity to land distribution issues. The year 2010 was the
                                 third time a presidential candidate from the PT was running for office with real chances
                                 to win, and the results of a tiny agrarian reform and dissatisfaction with that policy
                                 could impact demonstrations against the PT government by agrarian reform supporters.
                                 However, the actual figures on the number of settlements created during the two terms
                                 of President Cardoso do not differ considerably from those created during Lula’s two
                                 terms. Both, the Brazilian Social Democratic Party, PSDB (<i>Partido Social-Democrata Brasileiro</i>) and the Workers’ Party, PT (<i>Partido dos Trabalhadores</i>) achieved advances for the rural population with progressive public policies. However,
                                 they both chose to carry out a conservative land reform greatly benefiting agribusiness
                                 instead of reducing inequality in the countryside. The result was more land concentration
                                 and less income for the poor rural population [<a href="#R29">29</a>], expanding areas for sugarcane (for the production of ethanol) and soybeans intended
                                 for agribusiness. There was an increase in the number of victims of land conflicts
                                 both among peasants and agribusiness industrial farmers [<a href="#R27">27</a>].

                                 and decision makers, land occupations are strategically planned to rouse Government

                              <p id="d1e796">Data is available as of the year of the promulgation of the new Brazilian Constitution,
                                 in 1988, when the social function of the land became an intrinsic part of mobilizations
                                 surrounding the issue of agrarian reform, encouraging groups of landless rural workers
                                 to occupy primarily private land provided it was unproductive.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e798">The same fluctuations can be observed both on the number of occupations and the number
                                 of people involved in them. Similarly, in election years when a candidate from the
                                 Workers Party (PT) had a real chance of winning (2002, 2006 and 2010) the number of
                                 occupations and of participants dropped. The opposite occurred in previous election
                                 years, 1994 and 1998, when Cardoso was the front-runner candidate and subsequently
                                 won. This indicates that there is political coherence in the movements participating
                                 in the struggle for agrarian reform, although in absolute numbers, as previously mentioned,
                                 the number of settlements achieved does not differ drastically. During the eight years
                                 of the Cardoso administration, 584,655 families were settled, compared to 614,093
                                 settled families during Lula’s two terms ([<a href="#R39">39</a>] p. 46). Yet, the available area for these settlements was significantly larger in
                                 the PT administrations, demonstrating the party’s affinity for agrarian reform. However,
                                 in terms of governance, when alliances are not always ideologically coherent, it is
                                 more difficult to implement land redistribution policies that benefit poorer peasants.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e803">Among members of Congress, the so-called Rural Caucus (<i>Bancada Ruralista</i>) was formed to advocate privileges for large landowners and oppose the agrarian reform.
                                 These politicians belong to different political parties and many were in the governing
                                 coalition during Cardoso’s, as well as Lula’s and Dilma Rousseff’s administrations.
                                 This suggests a voting ambiguity on issues relating to land distribution and agricultural
                                 activity in both houses of the Brazilian Congress. To illustrate this idea, in the
                                 1994 and 1998 elections there were about 150 congressmen forming the Rural Caucus.
                                 Its ideological scope ranged from right to center-left, which made land redistribution
                                 in the country politically unfeasible ([<a href="#R22">22</a>] p. 164). This can be considered a great obstacle in achieving fairer land distribution
                                 in the country.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e811">Both mobilization activities and land occupations organized by civil society entities
                                 encumber participants’ involvement in order to receive a plot of land, which, in the
                                 end, is nothing more than selective incentives ([<a href="#R40">40</a>] p. 51) to participate in this risky endeavor.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e816">With the risks involved in collective action of this kind, Figure <a href="#Fig03">3</a> shows the number of peasants and supporters killed over issues pertaining land dispute.
                                 This figure includes participation in mobilization activities organized by social
                                 movements. The data confirms that participation in the struggle for land can result
                                 in death, as illustrated by data from the CPT.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e821">An interesting fact observed in the data is that, after 1988 (when the democratic
                                 regime came into effect in Brazil) the number of killings over land disputes was significantly
                                 reduced. The year coincides with the promulgation of the 1988 Constitution, which
                                 transformed agrarian issues and facilitated expropriation in the case of unproductive
                                 land and non-compliance with the social function as described in the document. During
                                 the first three years of the democratic regime (1985–1988), the number of killings
                                 over land disputes was huge. The new Constitution may have played an important part
                                 in changing this, influenced by additional factors, such as the emergence and strengthening
                                 of social movements. That is, from that year on, there were laws that benefited disadvantaged
                                 rural groups by favoring land distribution and expropriations by compensating landowners
                                 in case the land did not comply with the minimum production standards. Moreover, non-governmental
                                 organizations that were legally supported by the Government advocated for the peasants’
                                 interests, providing attorneys, land surveyors and other available assistance. Therefore,
                                 the peasants were no longer <i>alone</i> against large landowners and were increasingly aware of the laws and strategies to
                                 legally acquire a plot of land, although they often gave the impression of civil disobedience
                                 by occupying land that belonged to others.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e826">Despite the decrease, killings over land dispute continue to happen, even though the
                                 number has been stable since the promulgation of the 1988 Constitution. Violence ensues
                                 and peasants are being killed and suffering numerous human rights violations as a
                                 result of the struggle for land redistribution.

                              <p id="d1e844">In 2003, there was an abrupt increase in the number of people that died as a result
                                 of land conflicts. It was in the beginning of Lula’s first term in Office. This hike
                                 in the number of deaths caused by land conflicts can be interpreted as a result of
                                 the peasants’ and their supporters’ high expectations generated by the workers’ party
                                 assuming the Federal Government for the first time. Consequently, there is an explicit
                                 increase in land conflicts because the peasants and smallholders understand that the
                                 government is on their side and that it can finally implement the agrarian reform
                                 more vigorously. Concurrently, the large landowners and agribusiness entrepreneurs
                                 are willing to defend their territory and, thus, more deaths result from these clashes.

                                 be referred to as agrarian reform, because it is forced by land occupation and other
                                 activities that pressure authorities. It is not a planned agrarian reform, executed

                                 in Brazil. In the two terms of President Cardoso’s administration there were 4,310
                                 settlements created, while 3,602 settlements were created during the eight years of
                                 Lula’s administration. However, the extension of settlements increased during Lula’s

                                 was much larger. This allows both for subsistence and trade to take place in the establishments

                              <p id="d1e891">We have to differentiate two terms used in the international literature, which are
                                 not applied in the Portuguese and Spanish languages for lack of the expression “Land
                                 Reform”, but only Agrarian Reform. Thus, there is confusion in the discussion of the
                                 agrarian issue in Latin America. Agrarian reform generally embodies land reform as
                                 its most important element. “Agrarian reform includes both redistributing land and
                                 assisting new landowners by assuring them inputs and markets, extending credit and
                                 imparting certain technology that will help them to become agricultural producers”
                                 ([<a href="#R43">43</a>] p. 12). Of prime importance is the rural credit and technical knowledge. Peasants
                                 and peasants’ cooperatives in possession of newly acquired title lands can accomplish
                                 little, if anything, without access to adequate financial resources, enabling them
                                 to purchase seeds, stock, tools, fertilizers, pesticides, etc. and install water supplies
                                 in some cases. Therefore, the Lula administration’s larger average-sized settlements
                                 do not imply more quality than those of previous administrations. Nonetheless, given
                                 data restrictions, it is not possible to analyze land fertility or infrastructure
                                 elements such as access to schools, electricity, roads, medical services, and so on.

                                 When there is real distribution to families who need it most, it enables productivity,
                                 and these families leave the poverty line, reducing the pressure for survival and
                                 for land disputes.

                              <p id="d1e1053">While during the Sarney administration there was one person killed for every 5 settlements
                                 created, in the Collor/Franco administration there was one person killed for every
                                 7 new settlements. In the Cardoso administration, out of every 64 settlements, one
                                 person was killed over land disputes, and during Lula’s government, the number was
                                 46 new settlements per one killing over land disputes. That is the price paid in human
                                 lives to implement a public policy that is necessary to the survival of the peasantry,
                                 especially of the poorest. As more settlements are created, the tension between agrarian
                                 sectors over land acquisition decreases, as it allows more people to support themselves
                                 by farming their own land.

                              <p id="d1e1055">In terms of agrarian policy, the ineffectiveness of the State must be considered,
                                 regardless of which government currently holds office. According to data from NERA,
                                 there is a disparity that stands out between the number of families each settlement
                                 could hold and the number of families actually placed in these settlements. That is,
                                 in the twelve-year period observed in this study (2000–2011), 496,368 families could
                                 have been placed in the created settlements. However, the actual number of settled
                                 families was 366,621, or a 26 percent underperformance. This figure is not negligible,
                                 and could even improve the performance of the State with regards to civil society’s
                                 demands for agrarian reform.

                              <p id="d1e1057">What can be inferred from the data presented in this study is that violence in rural
                                 Brazil is derived from a lack of political interest to carry out land reform and achieve
                                 a more equitable distribution by the different levels of Government, which would correct
                                 mistakes of the past and break the vicious cycle the country has been dwelling in
                                 for centuries. Rural Brazil, unlike its urban counterpart, is lagging, as cronyism
                                 prevails and laws are not respected [<a href="#R22">22</a>], leading to a struggle between the strongest and the dispossessed. Extreme inequality
                                 among people creates insurmountable social chasms and requires state intervention
                                 to be repaired. The Brazilian State always favors large landowners and agribusiness.

                                 operating in agribusiness, allied to a financial sector, which invests in agriculture,
                                 requires State action. It is understandable that strong interest groups have put considerable
                                 pressure to increase the amount of land destined to agribusiness in the country. However,
                                 democracy should serve all citizens, and allow the poor to raise their living standards
                                 in rural areas by giving them access to land. The best social program for peasants
                                 is a plot of land so that they can derive their own livelihood from their work. Certainly,
                                 the <i>Bolsa-Família Program</i> [<a href="#R45">45</a>] helps the poor, but it has a temporary role to momentarily alleviate poverty. As

                                 the past two decades, the strategies used by social movements to achieve land distribution
                                 for low-income peasants have had a positive effect. There is still a lot to be done
                                 to repair this extreme inequality, but the first steps have been taken and are developing.
                                 The violence applied by large landowners and the reaction of the State towards the
                                 peaceful activities organized by social movements perpetuate the victimization of
                                 the peasants. In this sense, public policies to decrease violence caused by land disputes
                                 must be created, giving land to those that need it most. In order to avoid further
                                 bloodshed, agrarian reform must be a long-term commitment by the State, instead of
                                 belonging to this or that government at a given time in history.

                                 as more settlements are created fewer peasants die as a result of land conflicts.
                                 However, the path to further reducing that ratio is long and difficult. Both the lack
                                 of State intervention in land disputes and/or the failure of the police to protect
                                 rural workers and landless people could be seen as reasons for peasants to die in
                                 agrarian conflicts in Brazil. More needs to be done in rural areas to defend the poor
                                 and enforce the law, advancing democracy for all in Brazil.

                                          Plantations, which utilized slave labor in the Americas explored by the Europeans.
                                          This lasted until 1822, and originated the well-known latifúndio in the country.
