                                 Indonesia, which was once labelled as the dirtiest and most polluted river in the
                                 world. Using a theoretical framework based on actor-based security model, this research
                                 seeks to analyse a local community's experience in a village affected by severe environmental
                                 degradation of its river basin and its relation to other actors in security policy
                                 making process. The article explores how a local people evaluate the ongoing environmental
                                 degradation and its impacts to their life. This analysis leads to the finding that
                                 local people are aware of the threats from their environment, but at the same time
                                 they still have to depend on the economic activities that has been polluting the river.
                                 This condition makes them unable to advocate for what they experienced to the policy
                                 makers and choose to be resilient. On the other hand, the government's policies tend
                                 to ignore the perspective of the local community in formulating a security policy.
                                 This supports previous studies that the concept of human security still has little
                                 impact on addressing environmental issues, especially at policy level.&nbsp;</span></div>

                              <p id="d1e106">After the end of the Cold War, the focus of security studies shifted from military
                                 and inter-state studies to non-traditional threats with the potential to put people
                                 in danger. One of those is environmental degradation [<a href="#R1">1</a>, <a href="#R2">2</a>, <a href="#R3">3</a>]. That threat is due in part to increased industrialisation and changes in land use,
                                 especially in developing countries [<a href="#R4">4</a>, <a href="#R5">5</a>, <a href="#R6">6</a>]. One case which has caught the attention of the international media is the severe
                                 pollution of Citarum River in West Java, Indonesia. It came to public attention after
                                 several global mainstream media reports described it as ‘Indonesia’s Most Polluted
                                 River’ [<a href="#R7">7</a>] and the ‘World’s Most Polluted River’ [<a href="#R8">8</a>]. Previously, the Telegraph (2014) [<a href="#R9">9</a>] had published a story entitled ‘Citarum, the most polluted river in the world?’
                                 Unreported World (2017) [<a href="#R10">10</a>] also broadcast ‘The World’s Dirtiest River’.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e139">A case study by Greenpeace Indonesia and <i>Wahana Lingkungan Hidup</i> or Walhi (Life Environment Commission) of West Java found high levels of heavy metals,
                                 such as hexavalent chrome (Cr6+), and dangerous organic chemical pollutants, such
                                 as Diethyl phthalate (DEP), from industrial waste [<a href="#R11">11</a>]. The high content of faecal coliform and low dissolved oxygen concentration in the
                                 Citarum River also renders it incapable of meeting the minimum water quality standards
                                 [<a href="#R12">12</a>]. According to the Indonesian Ministry of Health [<a href="#R13">13</a>], such polluted water will affect people’s health if consumed. This condition is
                                 mainly caused by severe waste discharge along the river basin, especially in the upper
                                 area, from agriculture, industry, domestic workers, and another business services
                                 [<a href="#R12">12</a>, <a href="#R14">14</a>, <a href="#R15">15</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e163">From the perspective of human security, people who live in such perilous conditions
                                 are dealing with insecurity. As first formulated in the 1994 United Nations Development
                                 Project, Human Development Report (UNDP HDR), the concept of human security is comprised
                                 of two basic components: freedom from want and freedom from fear [<a href="#R16">16</a>]. The Secretary-General’s report of 2005 added a third pillar: the freedom to live
                                 in dignity [<a href="#R2">2</a>]. This idea has changed the way security is understood, especially since the end
                                 of the Cold War, from a state-centred to a people-centred view which posits security
                                 at the individual level. The main concept of the human security is that people have
                                 the right to live in dignity, free from poverty and inequality [<a href="#R17">17</a>]. In this light, the environmental degradation of Citarum River can be seen as a
                                 constant source of threat to the people living in its environs.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e174">The policy in the basin has long involved the interventions of national government
                                 and so little by little.international communities. Strongly influenced by green-neoliberalism,
                                 in 2007 the Indonesian government borrowed money from the Asian Development Bank (ADB)
                                 to create a project called ‘Integrated Citarum Water Resources Management,’ often
                                 abbreviated as ‘IWRM,’ to manage the severe pollution [<a href="#R18">18</a>]. This policy tried to integrate the disparate stakeholders to restore the water
                                 quality of the river by integrating rules and bureaucracy and involving public and
                                 non-governmental organisation (NGO) participation. The IWRM, however, did not work
                                 effectively in practice because of poor management between the agencies, incompetent
                                 human resources, and allegations of corrupt and inefficient government [<a href="#R18">18</a>, <a href="#R19">19</a>]. Seen in this light, previous policies only focused on security governance and often
                                 ignore the perspective of local communities who feel the negative impact directly
                                 from environmental polluting.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e185">The poor management of Citarum River resources inevitably raises the risk to human
                                 security. As pointed out by [<a href="#R3">3</a>], there are at least six threats that arise in degraded river environs: river ecosystem
                                 damage, food and clean water scarcity, energy shortage, social issues in the local
                                 societies and climate change. These environmental threats all occur in Citarum and,
                                 by way of contrast, government policies in overcoming these threats do not focus on
                                 dealing with human security issues that are actually faced by the local community
                                 around the river basin. These facts in the Citarum River support [<a href="#R2">2</a>] argument that after 20 years, human security as a concept still carries minimal
                                 impact on addressing environmental issues, including on how governments make security
                                 policy.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e193">In this study we use actor-based security model developed by [<a href="#R20">20</a>], where the function of this model is to identify various actors relevant to how
                                 security is understood. The perspective of local community, who are vulnerable and
                                 threatened, hence, becomes important in making security policy. Seen in this light,
                                 the Indonesian government’s policies in dealing with environmental threats in the
                                 Citarum River have not accommodated people’s own subjective assessment of their safety.
                                 Some research questions arise from this problem which will be answered including:
                                 how does the local community perceive the threats and safety they have experienced

                              <p id="d1e198">Drawing on the background earlier, this article attempts to analyse and advocate for
                                 local community’s perspective on environmental threats and its relation to the government’s
                                 security policy. In doing so, the article uses a case study method to explore how
                                 the local community in Sukamaju Village, whose residents are particularly vulnerable
                                 to the threats noted above, perceives the nuisance they experience. In this article,
                                 we first discuss the theoretical framework as well as methodology in detail. Then
                                 next, we try to describe the results of the interviews with several local community
                                 sources about human security issues and the dilemmas they were experiencing. Finally,
                                 we explain the relationship between the local community perspective and the existing
                                 security policy by using an actor-based security model.

                                       A Theoretical Framework
                                    </h3>
                                    <p id="d1e206">Some literatures assert that the emergence of human security as a people-centred rather
                                       than state-centred approach to human development began with the issuance of the UNDP’s
                                       HDR in 1993 and 1994 [<a href="#R2">2</a>, <a href="#R16">16</a>, <a href="#R21">21</a>]. This report is often considered to have changed the mainstream security paradigm
                                       after the Cold War, which initially focused on military power and inter-state conflict
                                       as the key to global peace. As discussed in the introduction, in 2005, through the
                                       UN Secretary-General’s report, the concept of human security was based on three main
                                       pillars: ‘freedom from want and fear, and the freedom to live in dignity’([<a href="#R2">2</a>], p.&nbsp;15). The main idea of the human security is that people have the right to life,
                                       dignity, freedom from poverty, and equal opportunity to develop their potentials.
                                       In other words, this perspective is mainly spawned by the cosmopolitan notion of a
                                       universal humanity providing a framework to decide who is vulnerable (in terms of
                                       security) and must be protected [<a href="#R17">17</a>]. In the study of International Relations, human security occupied the realm of the
                                       normative theory that discusses how the world should be managed and what choices should
                                       be made by decision makers. In contrast to the realism approach, which explains why
                                       countries compete with each other in an anarchic system, human security assesses whether
                                       behaviour is morally acceptable and how it affects individuals and society [<a href="#R16">16</a>].
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e227">Therefore, unlike the traditional security paradigm where the referent object is the
                                       state, the focus of human security is the individual, groups of individuals and communities.
                                       People encounter threats and danger from various directions—to health, access to food
                                       and water, or the environment—which are no longer solely from the weapons of foreign
                                       military forces. Hence, human security is not just a concern for the state but involves
                                       many actors, including NGOs, business people, religious organisations, and various
                                       civil society movements. Human security can be achieved if there is collaboration
                                       from various parties to achieve a comprehensive security condition, which releases
                                       people and society from all fears and needs [<a href="#R17">17</a>].
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e232">In relation to the issue of environmental degradation, human security also raises
                                       the matter of the emergence of potential threats and dangers to people from the environment
                                       [<a href="#R22">22</a>] A special concern over environmental damage as a threat to security emerged after
                                       the Cold War. Homer-Dixon (1991, cited in [<a href="#R23">23</a>]) states that environmental damage can lead to conflict, especially in poor countries,
                                       through four factors: 1) reduced agricultural production; 2) economic decline; 3)
                                       forced displacement of population; and 4) disruption of social relations. However,
                                       as stated by [<a href="#R2">2</a>], while human security has actually brought attention to environmental security as
                                       one of its important elements since 1993, in its development, environmental security
                                       has become more independent and emergent from its roots in human security. In fact,
                                       according to Elliott, the study of environmental security is better understood by
                                       using the orthodox security paradigm that focuses on the state as a referent object.

                                    <p id="d1e243">More operationally, in analysing the concept of human security to environmental policy
                                       in Citarum, this research uses the actor-based security model developed by [<a href="#R20">20</a>].
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e248">In this case, it starts with a vulnerable local community affected by environmental
                                       degradation as a key actor in security policy. As seen in Figure <a href="#Fig1">1</a>, this model gives voice to that community’s fears and concerns, and allows its experience
                                       to be taken into consideration in policy setting, which aligns with Elliott’s notion
                                       of the importance of attending and integrating the local community as a fundamental
                                       requirement of human security [<a href="#R21">21</a>]. Security is a process of moving toward a secure feeling, by identifying the cause
                                       of the fear and finding ways to overcome it. It opens the discussion on the vulnerability
                                       and insecurity experienced by local populations. It has two objectives: first, to
                                       reveal the source of their insecurity, and then to discuss how to regain their security
                                       [<a href="#R20">20</a>].
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e259">Security can be achieved if individuals or actors have the freedom to identify factors
                                       that threaten what they perceive as valuable. They want freedom for opportunities
                                       to convey the threats to other actors, and the ability to mitigate those threats.
                                       Society is one of the actors, together with industry and NGOs, the media, the military,
                                       government officials and researchers. Thus, threats that are perceived (and expressed)
                                       by local actors can be synchronised with threats identified by researchers. Other
                                       actors also convey their perspectives on security and threats in particular contexts,
                                       which can then be used as a basis for seeking compromises or solutions [<a href="#R20">20</a>].

                                    <p id="d1e291">The Citarum River Basin is commonly used by the surrounding communities, which leads
                                       to a conflict of interests between groups fighting over water resources. According
                                       to [<a href="#R25">25</a>], there are at least three contested interests in the Citarum River Basin for the
                                       use of water resources: the domestic sector, including agriculture; the urban sector;
                                       and industry. This is confirmed by [<a href="#R6">6</a>], who assert that the causes of environmental damage to the river regions are the
                                       shifting functions from forest land to urban and industrial lands. A study conducted
                                       by [<a href="#R4">4</a>] examines Land Use and Land Cover Change (LULCC) in the upper Citarum River Basin
                                       from 1997 to 2014. It describes how agriculture was the dominant use covering nearly
                                       65% of the upper Citarum River Basin, followed by 15% developed area, 10% forests,
                                       and 10% other uses. There has been a significant change in land use over the last
                                       two decades with burgeoning agriculture expansion and urban sprawl, and drastically
                                       decreasing forest area [<a href="#R4">4</a>]. In the context of land use change, it is more due to drastic population growth
                                       and massive economic development in the area of the Greater Bandung Area, which is
                                       the main area of the upper river basin [<a href="#R4">4</a>]. This land use change has been the biggest contributor to large scale deforestation
                                       and environmental pollution in the Citarum River Basin.

                                       and NGOs, including local and international media. Some clean water procurement programmes
                                       have been conducted in the village, although they are still temporary. When we conducted
                                       the field research in July-November 2018, the people of Sukamaju were still using
                                       polluted water for personal sanitation.

                                    <p id="d1e327">The field research was carried out from March to November 2018. It used a qualitative
                                       approach and a case study method which focused on qualitative data such as interpretation
                                       of the findings gathered from the informants. Case study was chosen as the method
                                       for data collection, which is comprehensive and deep for ambitious cases seen as relevant
                                       and compelling [<a href="#R27">27</a>]. By using this method, the research contexts of space, time and theme are key.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e332">As described earlier, we chose Sukamaju Village, Bandung Regency, West Java Province,
                                       Indonesia as a research location. The village is relevant and compatible with the
                                       theoretical framework, in which there are at least three contested interests in the
                                       struggle for water resources—domestic sector, urban sector and industry [<a href="#R25">25</a>]. All three are represented in the village and its district, Majalaya, which also
                                       plays a role as a buffer for Bandung City, through which the river flows. Like many
                                       industrial areas which intersect with agricultural areas, its position is on the urban-rural
                                       border. As such, it represents the inter-actor complexities in the region. The most
                                       important objective in choosing Sukamaju Village as a research locale was that it
                                       is situated in Sector 4 of the Citarum River Basin, which is the first sector along
                                       the basin affected by environmental pollution from industrial waste.

                                    <p id="d1e337">Interviews were conducted with sources using the snowball method, in which subsequent
                                       sources are determined from the findings during the study. The interviews were done
                                       in two stages. The first was to meet the sources from several active stakeholders,
                                       including the Environmental Agency of West Java Provincial Government and some NGOs,
                                       such as <i>Wahana Lingkungan Hidup</i> or <i>Walhi</i> (Life Environment Commission) of West Java and Elemen Lingkungan or Elingan (Environmental
                                       Element). Using open-ended questions, the interviews were allowed to develop along
                                       with discussions and findings in the field. Secondly, the interviews were conducted
                                       either one-on-one or by group discussion with people from Sukamaju Village. Twenty
                                       people were interviewed, of whom 17 of them are listed in Table <a href="#Tab1">1</a> below.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e348">In analysing the data, the research passed through several stages: 1) labelling and
                                       memo writing; 2) theme-based categorisation of the threat(s) experienced by people
                                       and their responses; and 3) interpretation of findings [<a href="#R27">27</a>]. As a first step, we conducted the labelling and writing process of the data collected
                                       from the interviewees. This process was carried out inductively on the entire data
                                       set so that it could be seen which data were relevant and which were not. We then
                                       categorised the data that had been labelled based on a thematic study derived from
                                       a theoretical framework. This data categorisation was done so that the structure of
                                       the overall data could be known and validated with triangulation techniques. Finally,
                                       from the theme-based categorisation, we interpreted the data with the help of a theoretical
                                       framework as a heuristic device for analysing and summarising the research findings.

                                    <p id="d1e511">Since research of [<a href="#R18">18</a>] several years ago, the negative effects of pollution in Sukamaju Village still remain
                                       in various dimensions. In the health sector, for example, people near the river, especially
                                       those close to industrial areas, often experience health problems due to the industrial
                                       waste and pollution. In the agriculture sector, productivity of rice production centres
                                       in West Java, such as the Rancaekek District, have dropped dramatically. The poor
                                       condition of the river has been ongoing for decades, but the local and central governments
                                       have not managed to overcome it. This has led to dissatisfaction with government in
                                       the affected societies.

                                    <p id="d1e516">This section will show our exploration how local people perceive the security threats
                                       they experience. The general question posed to them was how they felt about the dirty
                                       water conditions, skin diseases, smells, floods and coal dust from factories around
                                       the village. Regarding the concept of security, almost all interviewees were confused
                                       when asked, ‘Do you feel threatened by this condition?’ or ‘Do you feel safe?’ When
                                       the questions were rephrased with the words ‘fear’ or ‘anxiety’, they immediately
                                       understood and were able to express their feelings of insecurity. From the submitted
                                       answers, a number of threats, fears and anxieties sources could be identified.

                                          <p id="d1e521">Almost all interviewees stated that it is difficult to find clean water due to waste
                                             pollution by the textile factories along the river. This has been the case in Sukamaju
                                             over the last decade, especially in Bale Kambang and Leuwi Dulang area, since the
                                             textile factories laid claim to this portion of the river basin along Sector 4. The
                                             change of land functions from agriculture to industry without good environmental management
                                             has damaged the availability of clean water for residents. This massive transfer of
                                             land functions into industrial land is more driven by foreign investors who compete
                                             with local textile industries.
                                          </p>
                                          <p id="d1e523">According to Kat, interviewee 7, an elderly citizen in Sukamaju, the biggest issue
                                             faced by the Sukamaju residents is the scarcity of clean water not only during the
                                             dry season, but throughout the year. Residents are unable to access clean water provided
                                             by Perusahaan Daerah Air Minum or PDAM (Regional Water State-Owned Enterprise) because
                                             of the limitation of the catchment area and the costs, which they find expensive.
                                             PDAM water is only enjoyed by a few people who live near the main road in the Majalaya
                                             District.
                                          </p>
                                          <p id="d1e525">To fulfil their sanitation needs, the residents depend on river water contaminated
                                             with industrial waste. As Kat said: <i>‘If the river water is contaminated with red waste, the water we get is also red.
                                                If the waste is yellow, the water will turn yellow’.</i> Kat said that the colours come from fabric dyes in textile factories which are dumped
                                             directly into the river. Another source, Ana, interviewee 9, said: <i>‘For cooking purposes we prefer to buy bottled or refilled water, while for bathing
                                                or washing we inevitably use Citarum water’.</i> Water pollution also affects the quality of public wells in various places in Sukamaju.
                                             According to Kat: <i>‘The polluted water seeps and affects groundwater, including the public wells. There
                                                used to be a well that could be considered to be the cleanest, but now it has been
                                                polluted by river water seepage, and that water is also dirty’.</i>
                                             
                                          </p>
                                          <p id="d1e536">As observed during the field research, the water used by residents for washing, bathing,
                                             and cooking contained dirt particles and was not clear. Residents kept the dirty water
                                             in a bucket for several days until the particles settled and then used it for cooking.

                                          <p id="d1e538">Based on the findings, the scarcity of ground water in Sukamaju is caused by several
                                             factors. First, textile factories around Sector 4 of the river basin directly dump
                                             their industrial waste into the river without processing it first. This has a detrimental
                                             effect on the quality and acidity of the water. The infiltration of ground water has
                                             also affected residents’ wells in Sukamaju. Secondly, the textile factories also control
                                             Citarum’s water resources in the upper reaches of Sector 4, where the Radug Water
                                             Gate managed by the Bandung Regency Government is located. According to several interviewees,
                                             water canals for residents were often co-opted by the industries, including water
                                             canals for agricultural irrigation purposes. Third, the textile factories also use
                                             artesian wells to extract ground water for production purposes, thereby disrupting
                                             the ground water availability for residents’ wells, most of which are shallow: <i>‘So this factory extracts water from the ground, draws water from the river, and there
                                                are many artesian wells that violate the regulated quota limits. So of course we have
                                                ground water scarcity for the residents’</i> (Tar, interviewee 10; Usu, interviewee 11).

                                             A number of interviewees, particularly women, claimed to feel anxious every time they
                                             showered because the water was dirty: <i>‘Yes, I’m afraid, but I just pray. After all, what can I do?’</i> (Eni, interviewee 6). One of the interviewees said that they had gotten used to health
                                             threats due to polluted water because there was no other choice: <i>‘Well, what can I do? It’s been so common’</i> (Kat, interviewee 7).

                                             they do not have good immunity. <i>‘Most children like to play in the water or on the river, and usually they will suffer
                                                from skin diseases. So we generally use BPJS [Badan Penyelenggara Jaminan Sosial;
                                                National Body for Social Insurance] to treat children’s skin diseases’</i> (Kat, interviewee 7).

                                             skin diseases. She also complained that if her child was sick, she would have to take
                                             him to the Public Health Centre, and it meant she had to spend extra money; as much
                                             as 12,000 IDR (slightly less than USD$1) for public transport and medicine. Her husband

                                             Public Health Centre, she was scolded by the medical staff:<i>‘You already know that the water is dirty, why still use it to take a bath [but] what

                                             again. Her husband, who worked in the factory, died from a respiratory illness. Ati,
                                             interviewee 4, expressed her worries about the condition of her two-year-old son who
                                             had begun to develop respiratory diseases: <i>‘Back then, children rarely suffered from respiratory illness. Now it is common that
                                                young children has already has respiratory pain’</i>. Similarly, Lily, interviewee 13, claimed that her child suffered from asthma because
                                             every day she was exposed to coal-fired air pollution from a factory directly opposite
                                             her house.

                                          <p id="d1e577">Ana explained that textile factories around Sukamaju dispose of their smoke waste
                                             daily. For them, ‘it is so common that there is coal dust on the roof and on the banana
                                             leaves’. Uma, interviewee 8, also complained of the same thing: <i>‘Coal smoke floats off depending on how the wind blows. If the wind goes to the residents’
                                                areas, the smell makes me dizzy. In the rainy season, the dust will become smelly
                                                mud and make it itchy’.</i> Besides the children, according to Tar, interviewee 10, air pollution is also dangerous
                                             for the elderly.

                                             floods during the rainy season. In the past few years, Majalaya District has often
                                             been hit by flash floods resulting in huge losses. As Lily, interviewee 13, one of

                                    <p id="d1e622">The fear and anxiety of Sukamaju residents described above is an insecurity expression
                                       caused by environmental threats in the river. Although most residents lack security
                                       awareness, the way they see and perceive the conditions and problems shows that these
                                       environmental threats have become a source of fear and anxiety in their lives. However,
                                       further findings in this study indicate that this fear and anxiety comes not only
                                       from environmental threats, but also from the dynamics that arise in the relationship
                                       between the economic structures of citizens and industry.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e624">When the female interviewees are asked if they tried to protest against the factory,
                                       some answered that it was men’s business. When asked who was responsible for polluting
                                       the river water, Wina, interviewee 2, replied, <i>‘I don’t know. A lot of fear’</i>. Some of interviewees stated that they had participated in a strike protesting against
                                       the factory, but their protests were not heard. Apart from people’s aspirations that
                                       were not heard by industry players, people also feared being fired. Many people in
                                       the village did not want to take part in the protest because they were afraid of being
                                       fired from the factory. This was confirmed by another interviewees who stated that
                                       she and her husband did not want to join the protest because they needed money from
                                       the factory even though she said that inside the factory the air was suffocating due
                                       to the use of coal.

                                    <p id="d1e629">Almost 80% of Sukamaju residents depend on textile factories for their livelihoods.
                                       This economic structure relationship increases people’s fears that were originally
                                       only environmental threats to include an economic threat. Many people remain silent
                                       and compromise with polluted water conditions and unhealthy environments as long as
                                       they still get money from the textile factories to survive: <i>‘For example, when Citarum Harum programme which involves Siliwangi Regional Indonesian
                                          Military Command was launched, disciplinary actions were carried out by closing illegal
                                          sewage holes in factories. However, as a result there were lots of layoffs in a large
                                          number, many of which are Sukamaju residents. This clearly creates a dilemma for the
                                          residents’</i> (Kat, interviewee 7).

                                    <p id="d1e634">The residents do not dare protest because the village officials would immediately
                                       report to the factory and the participants would be threatened with being fired, although
                                       nowadays courage has recently arisen among residents as assistance from several NGO
                                       activists has emerged. However, their advocacy efforts often clash with industry-paid
                                       people or security guards. There is potential for horizontal conflict between residents
                                       intentionally carried out by the industry players. According to one of the interviewees
                                       from a local NGO, there is often intimidation from mass organisations, factory thugs,
                                       security guards.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e636">In terms of human security, intimidation can be seen as another form of threat to
                                       humans in the case of industrial structure relations in Sukamaju. Intimidating methods
                                       by the factory towards the control of water resources can also be seen at the Radug
                                       Water Gate located in the upstream area in Sector 4 of the river basin. Based on the
                                       findings in this research, there are several potential horizontal conflicts where
                                       residents from Sukamaju are desperate and try to seize water resources from the factory:
                                       <i>‘Only a few years ago, there were residents who brought hoes and machetes to request
                                          for water’</i> (Usu, interviewee 11).
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e641">Due to the very high level of vulnerability in the struggle for water resources, many
                                       residents prefer to be silent and compromise with the situation as the only way to
                                       survive. According to the interviews, there was once government aid for clean water
                                       provision but, due to the limited water debit, conflict emerged between residents.
                                       This conflict led to an unsafe circumstances and residents felt threatened. Finally,
                                       the clean water supply was stopped because there was no assistance and supervision
                                       from the related agencies.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e643">We tried to triangulate the data to the official narrative regarding the affected
                                       society. The government acknowledges that its programme to develop eco-villages (villages
                                       that are healthy and safeguard the environment) can only reach a small part of the
                                       affected societies and that Sukamaju had not been touched. The programme to build
                                       an eco-village was carried out by recruiting 25 residents in a village. They were
                                       trained in the concept of environmental protection and waste management. Ideally,
                                       the surrounding villagers independently replicate and develop this concept in their
                                       respective areas. However, village officials do not have that eagerness and instead
                                       wait apathetically for the central government to arrive with the eco-village program
                                       ready-made. Village funds distributed by the central government are used for physical
                                       infrastructure projects that are not environmentally based, such as road construction
                                       and buildings not clean water installations and waste management.

                                    <p id="d1e645">In March 2018, the central government launched the Citarum Harum programme involving
                                       Indonesian military personnel to restore the condition of the river by issuing Presidential
                                       Regulation Number 15 Year 2018 [<a href="#R28">28</a>] about acceleration of Citarum restoration. According to interviewees, the army monitors
                                       the factories and prevents them from dumping chemical waste into the river, but factories
                                       always find ways so that coloured waste (which is strongly suspected to contain hazardous
                                       chemicals) is still dumped in the river when there is no supervision. The temporary
                                       presence of the army also prevents residents from throwing household waste into the
                                       river and gets them to work voluntarily cleaning the river. Since there is no waste
                                       processing installation, while the waste continues to be produced, it goes nowhere
                                       else but to the river.

                                 the Threat
                              </h4>
                              <p id="d1e653">The findings in this research indicate that the Sukamaju residents understand and
                                 are aware of the security threats from environmental pollution in the river. The fear
                                 and anxiety experienced by almost all interviewees, on topics such as the scarcity
                                 of clean water and potential disease, indicate that the residents are in a threatened
                                 condition. However, their awareness of environmental threats is not followed by their
                                 ability to articulate their fears and anxieties to other security actors, especially
                                 the government. Although there has been a lot of research and advocacy effort from
                                 various NGOs and universities, the residents of Sukamaju still have no means to influence
                                 policy.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e655">Their inability to convey what they feel to other actors ultimately causes them to
                                 be unable to mitigate the threats. This inability arises due to dilemmatic condition,
                                 where the source of fear is not only environmental, but also economic. Because they
                                 are economically dependent on the textile factories, most residents choose to keep
                                 quiet and compromise with the environmental threats. As a result, environmental threats
                                 are ultimately no longer perceived as a source of insecurity that needs to be anticipated.
                                 Instead, they tend to consider them as ordinary environmental hazards, such as skin
                                 disease or respiratory disease. Along with the exclusion from the security policy
                                 and the inability of residents to articulate their insecurity, the findings show that
                                 the residents tend to choose to survive and compromise with the threats rather than
                                 advocate their aspiration to policy makers.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e657">The increasingly massive and well-established industrial economic structure in the
                                 Sukamaju area has created two sources of latent fear and anxiety for citizens: environmental
                                 and economic threats in the form of dependence and intimidation. Residents are forced
                                 to hold back their fear over environmental threats to overcome economic threats due
                                 to industrialisation that are not environmentally based. Unfortunately, this threat
                                 is missed by the state as a policy maker, both at the central and local level.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e659">Meanwhile, the government’s policy in managing environmental issues in Citarum River
                                 is generally overlapping. At present, there is a synergistic and integrated management
                                 by <i>Tim Koordinasi Pengelolaan Sumber Daya Air</i> or TKPSDA (the Coordination Team of Water Resources Management) of the river region
                                 under a decree from the Minister of Public Works and Public Housing. In the field,
                                 there is the army involvement coordinated by the Governor of West Java Province. TKPSDA
                                 integrates programmes that have been prepared by both the local and central governments,
                                 but the army focuses more on physical movements, such as community service and waste
                                 management. The army has greater freedom in matters of waste. If a factory is found
                                 to dispose of coloured waste, the army immediately closes its water drain. As a result,
                                 industrial operations are hampered, and the factory lays off employees.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e664">According to the findings, physical projects carried out by the army, such as a river
                                 waste-cleaning programme, did not resolve the problem because it was primarily a waste
                                 pick-up method that did not address the human security issues suffered by the people
                                 who are directly affected by environmental pollution. Based on this regulation, the
                                 Citarum Harum programme also lacked a human security concern, as it did not regulate
                                 or give the authorities the incentives to restore and rectify the community’s quality
                                 of life that had been grossly affected by the severe pollution. This state-centred
                                 policy relies on bureaucracy and even military personnel. It tends to perceive the
                                 community as part of the environmental degradation problem, rather than as the victims.
                                 Accordingly, the government tends to dictate the threat indications to the people
                                 rather than involving them, to identify the threats they have been experiencing.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e666">Various programmes run by the government in last several decades always stop in the
                                 middle of the road. For example, in 2001 the Citarum Bergetar programme was launched.
                                 It sought to install 1,800 MW of electricity generation to meet the electricity needs
                                 in Java Island and Bali Island. In 2014 the Citarum Bestari aimed to make the river
                                 water drinkable by 2018. After previous failed attempts in managing the environmental
                                 issues, in 2018, a new programme called Citarum Harum was started, which involved
                                 a role for the Indonesian Army. These programmes were mainly financed by debt funds
                                 from the international community, such as the World Bank and ADB [<a href="#R18">18</a>, <a href="#R19">19</a>] Despite a large financial investment, however, they could not synchronise all the
                                 stakeholders. For example, some interviewees said that the pollution source upstream
                                 is generally liquid waste from chemical fertilisers used by farmers. This should be
                                 directed to generate organic fertilisers and encourage farmers to switch to ecological
                                 agriculture, but the Ministry of Agriculture, which has authority in this matter,
                                 continues to supply chemical fertiliser to the farmers from one of the state-owned
                                 enterprises.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e674">Strictly speaking, throughout the journey of managing environmental issues in the
                                 Citarum River, there is no good communication relationship between actors in the security
                                 policy which results in the state as a policy maker is not functioning properly. The
                                 government does not seem to pay proper attention to human security issues in the river
                                 despite of many researches from universities and political pressure of local NGO’s.
                                 The breakdown of articulation about the fear experienced by residents in Citarum River
                                 Basin area, especially in the Sector 4, made the country carelessly execute many failed
                                 environmental pollution prevention programmes. From the perspective of human security,
                                 the government does not seem to realise and understand the importance of citizens’
                                 freedom from fear of existential threats caused by environmental pollution. Instead,
                                 the local community perceives that the state is no longer a source of security, as
                                 said by Ren, interviewee 15 and a local NGO activist: ‘The government and its elites
                                 still treat it [the environmental issues in Citarum] as an economic and political
                                 commodity’.

                              <p id="d1e679">This research shows that there is a very complicated human security issue in the case
                                 of environmental degradation in the Citarum River Basin. Findings on local community
                                 perceptions show that there are sources of fear and existential threats due to environmental
                                 pollution. However, they should compromise with the threats as a form of resilience
                                 to survive and maintain their economic security, which is their economic dependence
                                 on textile factories in the area. The dilemma leads these residents to ignore and
                                 compromise with environmental threats as a form of resilience mechanism, such that
                                 they prefer to keep quiet rather than articulate what they feel to other actors. This
                                 dilemma and the inability of local people to advocate for themselves based on their
                                 experience, profoundly contributes to the ignorance of environmental policy made by
                                 the government.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e681">As the result, based on the actor-based security model, the tendency to silence and
                                 build a survival mechanism has marginalised local people from the security policy
                                 making process. There is an articulation channel that stagnates from residents affected
                                 due to their internal factors and external pressure. This study has tried to raise
                                 what is felt and perceived by the local community so that the most affected of them
                                 can be considered by the policy makers, both the government and other stakeholders.
                                 The government’s perspective that only looks at the prevention of river pollution
                                 is a solely state-centred policy that does not resolve the real threat source for
                                 residents of Sukamaju. This finding of the article supports previous research conducted
                                 by [<a href="#R2">2</a>] that, decades after its emergence, the idea of human security has had little impact
                                 on environmental issues, specifically in how people’s freedom from fear and want and
                                 also freedom to live in dignity are implemented in practice and policy level.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e686">In the context of Citarum River, we suggest that the Indonesian government needs to
                                 consider the perceptions and the conditions of local community, who are vulnerable,
                                 in security policy making process. Studies related to human security, thus, need to
                                 be developed to influence the security policy in overcoming environmental threats,
                                 especially in affected communities with marginal positions. Further research is needed
                                 to analyse the complexity of the implementation of human security on environmental
                                 issues.
