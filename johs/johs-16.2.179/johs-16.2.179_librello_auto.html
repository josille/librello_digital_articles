                                 destruction. A considerable portion of the population in both Afghanistan and Pakistan
                                 consists of youth. This paper discusses the impacts of unemployment, poverty, drug
                                 abuse, corruption, conflicts, and extremism on the experiences of young people in
                                 these countries. Vulnerabilities can become risk factors that, in turn, can increase
                                 the likelihood of youth being involved with the police. Although vulnerability and
                                 insecurity are common to both young women and men, girls and young women face additional
                                 challenges that increase their vulnerability to insecurities, such as gender-based
                                 violence. This article details how livelihood and personal insecurities are closely
                                 intertwined and further considers how these insecurities involve the police in one
                                 way or another. It argues that local community-oriented police initiatives and civil
                                 society organisation contributions can increase cooperation between youth and law
                                 enforcement agencies in addressing these challenges in a collaborative and trustful
                                 manner.</span></div>

                              <p id="d1e108">‘The future belongs to our youth’—these famous words by Nelson Mandela hold true for
                                 many emerging and developing countries. Seventy percent of the population in emerging
                                 and developing countries are youth [<a href="#R1">1</a>]. The World Bank’s Development Report (2011) highlights the problem of youth participation
                                 and calls for young people to be given more significant opportunities to participate
                                 in social life. If this does not occur, then the resulting frustration could lead
                                 to societal apathy and an increasing propensity for violence, the economic and social
                                 costs of which would be a predominant barrier to development. A process of this kind
                                 could lead to the destabilisation of the country in the medium to long term [<a href="#R2">2</a>]. While many scholars have considered that the rising number of young people drives
                                 the development of post-conflict countries, others have warned of a demographic disaster
                                 if increased attention is not placed on the concerns of youth, especially regarding
                                 youth unemployment, livelihood, education, and marginalisation [<a href="#R3">3</a>]. The consequences of ignoring these issues could be severe—particularly if the energies
                                 of the youth are channelled towards violence, extremism, and destruction. Such a path
                                 could further affect youth’s trust in governmental institutions, such as the police,
                                 which ensures security and safety, and it is paramount that their relationship with
                                 citizens is based on trust and rule of law.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e119">In post-conﬂict societies, issues of personal and livelihood security are often intimately
                                 intertwined. Therefore, there is a need to understand how local communities manage
                                 the broader set of issues comprising human security, which focuses on two main areas:
                                 ‘freedom from fear’ and ‘freedom from want’. It focuses on broader aspects of security,
                                 namely economic, food, health, environmental, personal, community, and political aspects,
                                 and on the different forms of interlinked insecurity that people experience [<a href="#R4">4</a>]. In its broadest sense, the term concentrates on human vulnerability, encompassing
                                 threats of all kinds [<a href="#R5">5</a>]. ‘A human security framework puts people’s security in focus, and opens for an analysis
                                 of not only multiple sources of insecurity faced by communities, but also diversity
                                 of civil institutions (governmental and non-governmental) which together can address
                                 people’s diverse security needs [<a href="#R6">6</a>]. Some factors that contribute to the risks and vulnerabilities of youth, such as
                                 lack of livelihood, insufficient access to quality education, poor health, and gender
                                 challenges, can lead young people to violence, exclusion, criminal gangs, and violent
                                 extremism. These insecurities are connected to law enforcement issues to varying degrees;
                                 in other words, the police are actively involved in confronting such law-and-order
                                 issues in and between communities. Paradoxically, the police can themselves be a primary
                                 cause of insecurity for the local population through violent behaviour and corruption,
                                 consequently creating a trust gap between law enforcement and citizens. For example,
                                 research from Latin American countries has revealed some of the challenges of police
                                 insecurity, namely militarised policing, corruption, police abuse of powers, lack
                                 of accountability, and violation of human rights [<a href="#R7">7</a>, <a href="#R8">8</a>, <a href="#R9">9</a>]. Likewise, research from Africa has shown similar cases of police aggression, corruption,
                                 and lack of trust as important causes of citizen insecurity [<a href="#R10">10</a>, <a href="#R11">11</a>, <a href="#R12">12</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e149">Considering the importance of addressing insecurities faced by youth and the need
                                 to build trust in post-conflict contexts, the question arises as to how citizens can
                                 improve their cooperation and trust the police. One line of approach is community-oriented
                                 policing (COP), which recognises close community partnerships and cooperation for
                                 providing safety and security, as well as building trust between the police and communities
                                 [<a href="#R13">13</a>]. COP strives for a paradigm shift from the exclusion to the inclusion of common
                                 people from policing, where common people are afforded a visible role [<a href="#R14">14</a>]. COP is both an organisational strategy and a philosophy that allows the community
                                 and the police to work together to solve problems of crime and disorder in novel ways
                                 and to ensure the safety and security of the public. The idea has two central components:
                                 transforming the practice and methods of policing, and taking steps to establish a
                                 relationship between the public and the police [<a href="#R15">15</a>, <a href="#R16">16</a>]. Most importantly, COP can facilitate a platform for youth to address their insecurities.

                              <p id="d1e163">Rich and varied literature exists concerning youth violence, conflict, and exclusion;
                                 however, one under-researched area concerns the preventive measures employed to overcome
                                 the various insecurities that youth face through the institution of COP. Therefore,
                                 this paper focuses on the following crucial questions: what insecurities do youth
                                 in Afghanistan and Pakistan face, and how do these insecurities affect their relations
                                 with the police? How can COP be useful in creating a better understanding between
                                 police and youth? Based on field research and desk studies from two case countries,
                                 Afghanistan and Pakistan, we explore the factors that lead to insecurities and how
                                 understanding their interconnectedness is fundamental to meaningfully address the
                                 day-to-day concerns of Afghan and Pakistani youth. The scope of the current paper
                                 is limited and does not represent the whole population of youth in either Afghanistan
                                 or Pakistan. We further understand that the current paper may pose more questions
                                 than it answers, but it does what a scientific paper should: answer some questions
                                 and expose more.

                              <p id="d1e165">The article is structured as follows. We begin with a brief literature review of youth
                                 insecurities, focusing on a broader human security perspective including discussion
                                 of gender and youth–police relations. The methodology section explains the methods
                                 utilised to study our research questions in the difficult context of Afghanistan and
                                 Pakistan. We then present our findings on the key drivers of insecurities and exclusions
                                 experienced by youth in our two case countries. This is followed by a discussion on
                                 COP activities in relation to youth in each of the case countries, including discussions
                                 on the role of civil society organisations (CSOs) and police-citizen bodies in building
                                 relationships and trust between citizens and police through their participatory dialogic
                                 approach. The article concludes with important lessons on building sustainable youth–police
                                 relations in post-conflict countries.

                                    <p id="d1e173">Several bodies of literature are relevant in exploring youth insecurities and police
                                       relations—for example, youth exclusion, livelihoods and radicalisation, gender, and
                                       policing literature. The theoretical discussions regarding youth and insecurities
                                       have centred around three major perspectives: the youth bulge theory, greed or opportunity
                                       perspectives, and grievance perspectives. The discourse within youth bulge perspectives
                                       has argued that a growing young population, coupled with unemployment, lack of economic
                                       opportunities, corruption, exclusion, marginalisation, and weak and oppressive political
                                       systems, provokes young people into violence and conflict, thereby causing a threat
                                       to peace, stability, and security [<a href="#R17">17</a>, <a href="#R18">18</a>]. However, others have criticised this view and warned against simplistic equations
                                       among youth, armed conflict, and violence [<a href="#R19">19</a>, <a href="#R20">20</a>]. Advocates of the greed or opportunity perspective have argued that young people
                                       are prone to join armed or violent groups that engage in violence, as doing so provides
                                       incentives in the form of material and protective benefits [<a href="#R21">21</a>, <a href="#R22">22</a>]. The avenues for joining such groups attract youth who are illiterate, poor, and
                                       desperate to fight their way out of poverty. Grievance perspectives state that youth
                                       participation in violent conflicts is due to various factors that cause deprivation
                                       and exclusion [<a href="#R23">23</a>, <a href="#R24">24</a>]. In-depth studies from West Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia [<a href="#R23">23</a>] have demonstrated that horizontal inequalities comprising ethnic, religious, or
                                       racial disparities affect the political, economic, and cultural status of people and
                                       thereby become a contributing factor in violent conflicts. Socioeconomic inequalities
                                       coupled with the lack of political participation can mobilise young people to engage
                                       in violent activities. These theoretical perspectives shed light on the different
                                       causes of youth insecurities, each highlighting different variables for youth vulnerabilities.
                                       Although demography is an important variable in understanding various insecurities,
                                       other factors—such as employment, lack of adequate livelihood opportunities, poverty,
                                       illiteracy, access to education, and corruption—also contribute to the risks and vulnerabilities.
                                       Our study from Afghanistan and Pakistan demonstrates that the factors that influence
                                       youth marginalisation and vulnerabilities are interconnected, and understanding them
                                       holistically is important.

                                    <p id="d1e206">Another relevant body of literature examines how poverty, lack of adequate job opportunities,
                                       and prevalent socioeconomic conditions can force young people to pathways of extreme
                                       radicalisation [<a href="#R2">2</a>, <a href="#R25">25</a>, <a href="#R26">26</a>, <a href="#R27">27</a>]. Various studies have identified a clear link between poor socioeconomic conditions
                                       and lack of livelihood opportunities that tempt young people to join the Taliban and
                                       ISIS in Afghanistan, and numerous researchers have observed a similar link in the
                                       case of tribal areas of Pakistan [<a href="#R28">28</a>, <a href="#R29">29</a>, <a href="#R30">30</a>, <a href="#R31">31</a>, <a href="#R32">32</a>, <a href="#R33">33</a>, <a href="#R34">34</a>]. For example, a study from Balk province in Afghanistan mentioned that ‘the most
                                       frequent cited drivers of insecurity were unemployment and poverty, which were described
                                       as being an ‘‘open door for the Taliban’’’ [<a href="#R35">35</a>]. Another study noted how ‘70% of young Taliban fighters in Afghanistan fight for
                                       money and not for ideology’ [<a href="#R36">36</a>]. As Bergen and Waldman (2014) explained, for young, unemployed people, joining insurgent
                                       groups is an ‘honourable way’ to feed their families [<a href="#R37">37</a>]. In addition, as Matusitz pointed out, ‘under circumstances of weak governance,
                                       unbridled corruption, and human rights violations, terrorism will blossom. This is
                                       a recurring theme’ [<a href="#R38">38</a>]. Similar studies on conflict in Pakistan have suggested that unemployment, poor
                                       socioeconomic conditions, and a sense of deprivation pave the way for radicalising
                                       the youth in the region [<a href="#R34">34</a>, <a href="#R39">39</a>, <a href="#R40">40</a>]. As the above research points out, for young people radicalisation becomes a coping
                                       strategy. Rather than assuming radicalisation to be solely a result of religious extremism,
                                       it can also come from poverty and socioeconomic marginalisation.

                                    <p id="d1e268">An important area of focus regarding youth and insecurities is the challenge of gender
                                       relations and inequalities. Young women are victims of direct and indirect violence
                                       in both conflict and peaceful contexts [<a href="#R41">41</a>, <a href="#R42">42</a>, <a href="#R43">43</a>]. Sexual and gender-based violence remains a significant problem for young girls
                                       and women, especially in fragile and post-conflict countries [<a href="#R2">2</a>, <a href="#R44">44</a>]. This is a particularly relevant challenge in Afghanistan and Pakistan [<a href="#R45">45</a>, <a href="#R46">46</a>]. The Global Rights Report (2008) provides insight into the problem facing women
                                       in Afghanistan, categorising the kinds of violence that affect them as physical violence,
                                       sexual violence, forced marriages, and psychological violence. The overall average
                                       for violence against women is 87.2%, and in Kabul it is 79.3%. The national average
                                       for physical violence is 52.4%, while in Kabul it is 47.7%; for sexual violence, the
                                       national average is 17.2%, while in Kabul it is 31.3%; for forced marriage, the national
                                       average is 58.8%, while in Kabul it is 50.2%; and for psychological violence, the
                                       average is 73.9% nationwide, and in Kabul it is 76.2% ([<a href="#R46">46</a>], pp.&nbsp;21-23). As the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) and
                                       the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) have reported
                                       (2009), findings reveal that Afghan women are subjected to an increasingly insecure
                                       environment. Women participating in public life face threats, harassment, and attacks.
                                       In extreme cases, women have been killed for holding jobs that are seen to disrespect
                                       traditional practices or are considered ‘un-Islamic’. As a result, women engage in
                                       self-censorship, restrict their movements, or discontinue their work. Threats and
                                       different forms of intimidation and attacks are harmful psychologically as well as
                                       physically ([<a href="#R46">46</a>], pp.&nbsp;1-2). Women in post-conflict areas are vulnerable to sexual and gender-based
                                       violence. Gender based violence is a major cause, and consequence of, an overall gender
                                       inequality in society.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e298">Another serious form of gender discrimination in Afghanistan is child marriage. According
                                       to the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) and the Afghan Independent
                                       Human Rights Commission, 57% of Afghan marriages are child marriages in which one
                                       partner is under the age of 16. In a study of 200 married underage girls, 40% were
                                       married between the ages of 10 and 13 years, 32.5% were married at 14, and 27.5% at
                                       15 [<a href="#R47">47</a>]. Child marriage is not considered an offence under criminal law, meaning that there
                                       are no criminal penalties for practising it, but it is prohibited under the Civil
                                       Code ([<a href="#R48">48</a>], p.&nbsp;41). It has severe consequences on education and health; for example, girls
                                       who marry at such a young age and then give birth to children are not prepared for
                                       being a mother and the responsibilities it involves. In particular, an Afghanistan
                                       Independent Human Rights Commission report notes runaways, suicides, self-immolations,
                                       murders, sexual perversion, and psychological disorders as the consequences of child
                                       marriage [<a href="#R49">49</a>]. Furthermore, child marriage has serious implications for literacy and leads to
                                       low levels of school enrolment for young girls. Additionally, the lack of employment
                                       and poverty force poor families to sell their girls into marriage to older men [<a href="#R50">50</a>].
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e312">A prevailing cultural practice called baad is another type of serious violence that
                                       Afghan girls and women face. This informal method of conflict resolution allows aggrieved
                                       families to end conflicts and restore peace by presenting or exchanging young girls
                                       or women with the aggrieved party as compensation for the crime or conflict experienced
                                       by the family. Not only is the practice of <i>baad</i> utilised to settle crimes such as murder, adultery, or rape, but it also acts as
                                       a symbol of restoring the wronged family’s honour [<a href="#R50">50</a>].

                                    <p id="d1e320">‘Honour’ killings represent an extreme form of gender discrimination. Women bear most
                                       of the brunt in honour killings, which occur when a woman runs away from a forced

                                       norms as actions that are prohibited for women [<a href="#R51">51</a>].

                                       young boys endure similar violence. The practice of <i>bacha bazi</i> (boy play) has been common in many parts of rural Afghanistan. It involves young
                                       boys wearing makeup, dressing as young girls, and dancing in front of older men. The
                                       boys are forced to have sexual intercourse with these older men, and if they refuse,
                                       then they are either raped or badly beaten. The boys’ ages range between 9 and 18
                                       years; they are typically from poor families and are recruited by wealthy men (e.g.,
                                       rich merchants, militiamen, warlords, police, and government officials) who promise

                                       this racket. Perpetrators are seldom prosecuted because they have high connections
                                       and sufficient money to bribe justice and security officials, who are sometimes perpetrators
                                       of the crime themselves [<a href="#R38">38</a>, <a href="#R54">54</a>].

                                       [<a href="#R59">59</a>]. For example, a study by Stewart (2016) conducted in rural Kenya demonstrated that
                                       livelihood affects gender relations. Changing livelihoods for both men and women impacts
                                       how young men view their traditional male roles in society. For example, traditional
                                       male livelihoods that are based on export crops, livestock or pastoralism, and labour
                                       migration are declining, while female roles are also undergoing a change as new livelihood

                                       threatens their social value, identity, and self-esteem, the implications of which
                                       result in growing violence and insecurity among young men, potentially leading to
                                       domestic violence, increasing criminality, and intergenerational disagreements: ‘when
                                       the traditional routes to becoming a man are blocked, young men may see violence as

                                       that the dynamics of violence and crime in Latin America and Caribbean regions are

                                       people face. The interconnectedness of poverty, unemployment, and poor educational
                                       systems forces young men to resort to violence and criminality, which in turn involve
                                       the police. Moser and van Bronkhorst (1999) point out how poor policing practices,
                                       corruption, and brutality also tend to aggravate violence between youth and police,
                                       thereby creating a deep chasm of mistrust. The diagram illustrates common insecurities
                                       that both groups face and additionally points to the gendered nature of these insecurities
                                       that affect young women and men differently. For young women, the same conditions
                                       lead to premature pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases due to prostitution, dependency
                                       on men, and the reproduction of poverty and violence. It further indicates that young
                                       women are double victims of these violent acts and crimes. Similarly, in terms of
                                       gender, our study builds on the interconnectedness of a broad set of insecurities
                                       that young men and women experience and how these insecurities are gendered in ways
                                       that often lead to violence and radicalisation.

                                    <p id="d1e405">Past research demonstrates that youth–police relations are complex and challenging
                                       and that these challenges vary across contexts. Perceptions and attitudes towards
                                       the police indicate that four variables—age, contact with police, neighbourhood, and
                                       race—have an impact on the attitudes towards the police [<a href="#R62">62</a>]. Police–youth relations are also affected by how officers use their discretionary
                                       powers when it comes to watching, stopping, searching, and arresting young people
                                       suspected of doing something wrong. Brunson and Pegram pointed out how aggressive
                                       policing strategies disproportionally affect youth of colour [<a href="#R63">63</a>]. Research has shown that negative experiences with the police have a more important
                                       bearing on the legitimacy and trust than positive ones. However, perceptions of trust
                                       can also increase if police can use such complaints about the police as a possibility
                                       for change by treating youth in an inclusive rather than an exclusionary manner [<a href="#R64">64</a>].
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e416">Universally, a key challenge is the perception and attitude of the police towards
                                       youth and vice versa [<a href="#R65">65</a>, <a href="#R66">66</a>]. Generally, young people are viewed through a dichotomous lens: they are either
                                       perpetrators or victims of crime. As Forman stated, ‘Public safety turns, to a great
                                       extent, on what the young do and what is done to them. This is the group most likely
                                       to engage in criminal conduct, to be victims of crime, and to be targeted by the police’
                                       [<a href="#R67">67</a>]. Cooperation and engagement with youth in fighting, reducing, and controlling crime
                                       have been significant challenges for many police services around the world [<a href="#R20">20</a>, <a href="#R68">68</a>]. Furthermore, cooperation and engagement with youth critically depend on the level
                                       of trust and legitimacy that the police establish with the group. Foreman further
                                       posited that, ‘by treating the young exclusively as threats to public order, the state
                                       creates and reinforces attitudes of hostility and opposition. This has negative consequences
                                       for public safety because oppositional attitudes can increase law-breaking and make
                                       it less likely that citizens will provide information to law enforcement’ ([<a href="#R67">67</a>], p.&nbsp;2). Such police attitudes toward youth create tense and hostile relations that
                                       lead to mutual negative attitudes; in other words, youth generally feel that they
                                       are over-policed and under-protected.

                                    <p id="d1e437">In their seminal study, Dirikx et al. (2012) examined the attitudes of Belgian youth
                                       towards policing [<a href="#R69">69</a>] by focusing on three main aspects of policing: performance, distributive justice,
                                       and procedural justice. The performance-based perspective is based on how people view
                                       the efficacy of the police to control crime and keep neighbourhoods safe. The distributive
                                       justice perspective focuses on the fairness and quality of police services that people
                                       receive. Fair and quality service provided by the police to a diverse population would
                                       enhance their support amongst people. Lastly, the procedural justice perspective emphasises
                                       how people’s attitudes towards the police depend upon their judgments about procedural
                                       fairness, which depend on four elements: ‘the opportunities for participation that
                                       police officers provide in making their decisions; their friendliness and politeness;
                                       their neutrality; and finally, their trustworthiness’ ([<a href="#R65">65</a>] [<a href="#R69">69</a>], p.&nbsp;193). As shown above their study reveals a complex interplay of different variables
                                       that affect police–youth relations, as well as the heart of the dilemma in youth–police
                                       relations: trust.

                                    <p id="d1e448">A predominant challenge in post-conflict contexts is to establish cooperation and
                                       trust between communities and police services. Given the nature of post-conflict settings,
                                       trust levels are typically low. Policing research from post-conflict contexts has
                                       identified important factors that affect the nature of this relationship: lack of
                                       democratic policing, widespread corruption, illiteracy, abuse of police powers, and

                                       policing highlighted some interesting perspectives on police–community relations,
                                       covering eight northern districts of Kabul. Fifty-five percent of the respondents
                                       were in the 18–35 age group. The study identified the public’s experiences with and
                                       expectations for their local police, the public’s and the police’s understanding of
                                       basic concepts of democratic policing, and the public’s and the police’s recommendations
                                       for improving police effectiveness and the interface between them on a regular basis.
                                       Sixty percent believed that better cooperation between the police and the public would
                                       help improve security in the community, and 10% believed community policing to be
                                       positive. However, study participants from focus group discussions (FGDs) argued that
                                       there would be extremely limited cooperation between them and the police without the
                                       establishment of mutual trust, and a significant obstacle to cooperation and trust
                                       between them was corruption. According to the respondents, bribes to pay the police
                                       for them to process cases, abuse of power, abuse of police facilities, and corruption
                                       connected to higher levels of police, the justice system, and the government were
                                       seen as the major obstacles to establishing good mutual relations. In other words,
                                       lack of police accountability is a serious and important alienating factor ([<a href="#R73">73</a>], pp.&nbsp;5-7). This would influence in building good police-citizen relationships.

                                    <p id="d1e464">Another research report by Conciliation Resources (2018) described a series of FGDs
                                       in three provinces (Kabul, Nangarhar, and Kandahar) with young Afghan activists, members
                                       of civil society, and labourers. The youth were asked to share their views on a range
                                       of topics, such as peace, security, livelihood challenges, and their views of the
                                       future. The youth voiced a common complaint: the total disregard for the rule of law
                                       by local leaders, politicians, and security providers in the country. According to
                                       them, the police, Ministry of Justice, and Ministry of Education were the worst offenders
                                       against the rule of law, and their actions comprised stealing government resources,
                                       paying bribes to obtain admission to educational institutions or government jobs,
                                       and other crimes. As one respondent remarked, ‘I see an increasing gap between the
                                       government and the people, particularly young people who do not trust the government
                                       and authorities’ ([<a href="#R74">74</a>], p.&nbsp;6). The consequences of such gap can seriously hurt community involvement in
                                       local and national security needs.

                                    <p id="d1e469">A study conducted in Pakistan by the United States Institute of Peace (USIP) in 2011
                                       found that police are incapable of combating rising insecurities and violence because
                                       they are underequipped and understaffed and because there are various obstacles in
                                       upgrading the existing police structure and system. The study further recommended
                                       innovative and traditional mechanisms without which police would be unable to effectively
                                       improve. The study revealed that there is a consensus among Pakistanis that the police
                                       is unable to effectively fight crime, provide basic security to its common citizens,
                                       maintain law and order, and combat growing militancy [<a href="#R75">75</a>]. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) police in 2014 kicked off reform efforts regarding policing
                                       because the province is one of the most vulnerable to terrorism, militancy, and violence
                                       since it borders the conflict-torn tribal areas of Pakistan. There are numerous political,
                                       institutional, and technical reforms introduced in the KP Police Act 2017 aiming at
                                       depoliticising the police and bridging the gap between the general public (especially
                                       the youth) and the police [<a href="#R16">16</a>, <a href="#R76">76</a>, <a href="#R77">77</a>]. The existing studies on youth–police relationships and possible reform efforts
                                       lack rigorous research wherein the ground realities must be inquired about and explored.
                                       One of the objectives of this study is to unearth the real picture of existing youth–police
                                       relationships amid the conflict situation and the reform efforts in policing.

                                    <p id="d1e483">One common theme of the above research reveals is that establishing trust and accountability
                                       is crucial for creating and maintaining good police–youth relations. However, the
                                       research from Afghanistan and Pakistan has shown that creating trust between police
                                       and youth is not an easy task. There are barriers and impediments that must be tackled.
                                       For instance, corruption is a very serious issue that affects relations between police
                                       and the public. Violent behaviour on the part of the police also accentuates the relational
                                       gap; in fact, the police can be one of the major causes of local insecurity. Moreover,
                                       lack of interest or incapacity to deal with local law-and-order issues can also be
                                       a contributing factor in creating trust. However, we discuss further on in the paper
                                       how COP can be a suitable and relevant policing approach in building trust and cooperation
                                       between police and citizens.

                                    <p id="d1e491">In research, considerable debates and differences of opinion have erupted regarding
                                       the definition of youth. This tussle includes formal definitions that categorise youth
                                       in specific age groups or ranges with lower and upper limits for inclusion. The functional
                                       definitions consider the roles and responsibilities of youth, while social-psychological
                                       definitions emphasise growth, development, and the passage from youth to adulthood
                                       based on cultural, social, economic, and political factors [<a href="#R78">78</a>, <a href="#R79">79</a>]. These definitional cleavages are also present in youth definitions when it comes
                                       to our case studies from Afghanistan and Pakistan. However, as Williamson (2002) and
                                       Cursi (2017) noted, concerns about youth—whether challenges, hopes, or aspirations—should
                                       focus on the empirical realities that youth face rather than on definitional standpoints
                                       [<a href="#R78">78</a>, <a href="#R80">80</a>]. Our paper also concentrates on the empirical realities that Afghan and Pakistani
                                       youth face regarding their daily challenges and their consequences.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e505">In Afghanistan, the definition of youth is complex. The government of Afghanistan
                                       divides youth into two categories: pre-youth (<i>naw jawan</i>), comprising those 12–17 years of age, and youth (jawan), including those aged 18–35
                                       years; the first category refers to schoolchildren and the latter to young professionals.
                                       However, as Hall (2013) noted, the governmental definition of the term is based on
                                       a sociological understanding of the concept, which is contradictory to how youth define
                                       themselves. For youth, physical growth is a more important criterion than age. Nevertheless,
                                       the Central Statistics Organisation has a different categorisation of youth, dividing
                                       them into three categories: pre-youth (11–14 years), teenagers (15–19 years), and
                                       university students and young professionals (20–25 years) [<a href="#R81">81</a>, <a href="#R82">82</a>]. Moreover, the Afghanistan Youth Policy defines youth as people between the ages
                                       of 18 and 35 and adolescents as those between 12 and 18 years of age. The ages of
                                       the youth respondents in our case countries ranged from 19 to 35 years from both study
                                       areas [<a href="#R83">83</a>].
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e519">In Pakistan, the Ministry of Youth Affairs defines youth as a timeframe in which a
                                       family’s dependent children transform into independent adults and become responsible
                                       citizens of a community [<a href="#R84">84</a>]. This definition indicates that age is not a factor for people to fall into the
                                       youth category; rather, the determinant is their ability to contribute to society
                                       or their families. The prescribed age bracket of 15–29 years is consistent with the
                                       Commonwealth’s definition of <i>youth</i> [<a href="#R85">85</a>]. With regard to the percentage of youth, Pakistan is the fifth largest country globally.

                                       in-depth interviews (IDIs) and FGDs. The interviews were analysed through the coding
                                       of transcripts and interview notes, which led to the identification of themes that
                                       shed light on the nature of youth insecurity and youth–police relations. The themes
                                       emerged out of our discussions with youth, community members, social workers, and
                                       Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs); all of them voiced their major concerns around
                                       the insecurities that they faced in day-to-day life. The major topics centred on unemployment,
                                       corruption, drug abuse, and insurgent activities. The primary data were complemented
                                       by secondary research literature from the region. The secondary research literature
                                       aims to shed light not only on the themes emerging from the data, but on insecurities
                                       that are otherwise well-documented but not possible to sufficiently cover in this
                                       field study due to their sensitive nature and the lack of data from our research.
                                       The most important of these is gender-based violence. While we do not have data on
                                       this subject, we still focus on the nature of gendered insecurities. The focus of
                                       this study is therefore on the interdependence of a broader set of insecurities that
                                       are both gendered and linked with gender-based violence as documented elsewhere and
                                       as mentioned in general in interviews with CSOs and the police.

                                       workers were interviewed in Islamabad. During the period of our fieldwork (2015–19),
                                       the region experienced a historic constitutional amendment in 2018 wherein the tribal
                                       areas of Pakistan were merged with KP province. Most of the respondents hoped that
                                       this constitutional move would have positive impacts on socioeconomic conditions in
                                       the region. The criteria for selecting these areas were that Swat is a conflict-affected

                                    <p id="d1e536">The FGDs were composed such that a minimum of four and a maximum of eight persons
                                       were included in the discussion from various groups of respondents. The average time
                                       used for the FGDs was an hour and a half. The data were collected from both male and
                                       female youths, school and college teachers, local elders, <i>jirga</i> [<a href="#R86">86</a>] members, police personnel (both upper and lower ranks), NGO/INGO’s workers, and
                                       the general public (including shopkeepers, traders, and small vendors). The representation
                                       of female respondents was low because of the prevailing cultural obligations that
                                       restrict women from interacting with strangers, restrict their mobility, and prevent
                                       them from participating in political affairs. The primary data extracted from the
                                       FGDs were analysed manually, using matrices and thematic methods of qualitative data
                                       analysis. Themes were identified from the sections and subsections of the question
                                       guide used during the FGDs.

                                    <p id="d1e544">Regarding Afghanistan, we selected the province of Nimruz for several reasons. Firstly,
                                       it has been one of the provinces with the lowest levels of international intervention,
                                       and hardly any aid organisations operate in the region. Secondly, the province has
                                       one of the highest numbers of migrants and internally displaced people in the country,
                                       making it an interesting case to examine what unemployment and migration mean to young
                                       people. Thirdly, due to its location, it is the fulcrum of illegal migration, human
                                       trafficking, and the smuggling of drugs and narcotics.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e546">The data for Nimruz province are based on our fieldwork beginning in 2015. We interviewed
                                       young men, young women, members of CSOs, police personnel, and NGO representatives—both
                                       local and international. Additional data were collected from different local and international
                                       NGOs and CSOs working in Kabul. Both local and international police personnel involved
                                       with community policing were also interviewed. In addition, we talked with <i>shura</i> elders and members from selected <i>shuras</i> in Zanranj and Kang. We also conducted one FGD with five female elementary school
                                       teachers in the district of Kang through a female assistant known to the local researcher;
                                       the discussions with them revolved around employment, career opportunities, and personal
                                       safety. Furthermore, we conducted four separate IDIs with youth in the same district,
                                       and the topics of discussion revolved around livelihood opportunities, security challenges,
                                       corruption, migration, experiences with the police, and the young people’s aspirations
                                       for the future. In addition, we conducted open-ended and semi-structured IDIs with
                                       10 residents of a rehabilitation centre for addicted youth. Our attention focused
                                       on the root causes of their addiction and their stay in the rehabilitation centre.
                                       To fill the gaps in our past interviews and acquire fresh perspectives on the situation
                                       in Nimruz province, we conducted more than 10 telephone interviews with participants
                                       in the provincial capital of Zaranj in October 2019. Despite the disruptions, it was
                                       possible to speak with respondents from different occupations. We chose telephone
                                       interviews because the situation in Zaranj was quite volatile, and our field assistants
                                       faced death threats from Taliban and ISIS sympathisers. The major concern that people
                                       mentioned was the return of the Taliban [<a href="#R87">87</a>] to power. All respondents wanted to migrate [<a href="#R88">88</a>] to a safe place, and Europe was their desired destination. Many of them did not
                                       see any future in Afghanistan [<a href="#R89">89</a>].

                              <p id="d1e566">The major concerns of the youth, social workers, and community members that we interviewed
                                 in Nimruz point to four main areas of challenges that young people face: unemployment,
                                 poverty, drug abuse, and corruption. Although the field studies in Pakistan and Afghanistan
                                 differed in some respects, they also had common elements. For example, KP has been
                                 a hotbed of Islamic insurgency, whereas Nimruz province, unlike many parts of Afghanistan
                                 that suffer from rising insurgency and violence, has been relatively calm, although
                                 some areas have seen a slight increase in insurgent activities. Both regions have
                                 witnessed rising youth movements that have raised questions regarding police performance;
                                 however, the predominant threats to the citizens—and, particularly, the youth—in both
                                 regions are the deteriorating economic situation, unemployment, corruption, drug abuse,
                                 and increasing insurgent activities. This became apparent in our data, and the results
                                 of drivers of insecurity thus centre on the themes of unemployment, drug abuse, and
                                 corruption.

                                          <p id="d1e574">In Nimruz province, unemployment and poverty are paramount reasons for insecurity
                                             and exclusion among youth. The most common grievance that most respondents discussed
                                             is the lack of employment opportunities for local young people, which affects their
                                             daily livelihoods. Since agriculture is a predominant source of employment in this
                                             region, the lack of adequate water resources despite the abundance of cultivable land
                                             significantly affects employment opportunities. As one respondent told us, he and
                                             many others send their sons to Iran for work due to the lack of water and irrigation.
                                             Many children are removed from schools so that they can seek work in Iran. According
                                             to a civil society activist in Zaranj, the primary reason for Nimruz’s youth unemployment
                                             is the ongoing drought that has affected the province over the past few years. As
                                             he stated,‘Eighty percent of land in Nimruz is cultivable land, but lack of water
                                             due to drought has drastically affected livelihoods here. This means that a large
                                             number of people will be unemployed and have nothing to eat. A hungry person will
                                             do anything—like theft—to feed his family, and this can lead to insecurity.’ According
                                             to him, 70% of youth in Nimruz are unemployed, and out of the remaining 30%, only
                                             10% have a real job with security. As another respondent mentioned, ‘Unemployment
                                             is the biggest problem here. Then come corruption and drugs. All these badly affect
                                             young people.’ The impact of unemployment on young people can be disastrous, as it
                                             not only leads to corruption and drug abuse, but is also a primary cause of criminal
                                             activities, violence, and extremism. According to a <i>shura</i> elder from Nimruz, the primary reasons that youth join insurgent groups are unemployment
                                             and poverty: ‘When seven out of 10 youngsters in this locality are unemployed, there
                                             will be a rise in crime due to poverty [<a href="#R90">90</a>] majority of the youth have no other option. (It’s) crime or find illegal routes
                                             to Iran for job(s).’ The local population are aware of the indirect effects of unemployment
                                             on youth, as they witness them first-hand. Unemployed young people have few options
                                             in Zaranj: they can join the Taliban, anti-government groups, or criminal gangs; migrate
                                             to Iran to work as labourers; or join thousands of heroin users and roam the dumps
                                             of the city. These options may not be attractive, but they are the only choices available
                                             to these young people. As one respondent remarked, ‘Unemployment itself is not a threat.
                                             However, it can be a security threat. If a young person is unemployed and he has to
                                             provide for his family, he may resort to theft, joining armed groups, and drug smuggling.
                                             Unemployment and insecurity are part of a cycle and affect each other.’
                                          </p>
                                          <p id="d1e582">Another respondent added, ‘Moreover, when they start stealing and robbing people,
                                             this leads to police involvement and criminal cases against the youth’ The respondent
                                             further reiterated that unemployment is worse among women who cannot work in the private
                                             sector due to traditional societal norms and who are limited to specific jobs, such
                                             as teaching. He added that women are less likely to work in male-dominated environments.
                                             In a strictly patriarchal society in which men are the de facto heads of the household,
                                             it is difficult to accept that, in many cases, women are the sole breadwinners. A
                                             25-year-old Nimruz woman with the Afghanistan Youth Parliament told us that in Nimruz,
                                             women are often the only breadwinners for their families and that unemployment can
                                             thus gravely affect them. A male member of another civil society group in Zaranj further
                                             mentioned that unemployment and social obstacles to access employment opportunities
                                             could affect women’s social status and even expose them to violence. However, according
                                             to another informant, ‘Most of the women cannot work or do not have jobs, and (being)
                                             economically dependent on their husband(s) makes them more vulnerable to domestic
                                             violence.’
                                          </p>
                                          <p id="d1e584">In addition to having to contend with serious gender-based violent crimes, young girls
                                             and women also face day-to-day harassment either on the street or at workplaces. As
                                             a female informant from Nimruz mentioned, ‘Although there are some young women working
                                             for NGOs, but the number is small compared to the number of educated women available
                                             for jobs. This, I think, is because many girls and women face daily challenges of
                                             working with men.’
                                          </p>
                                          <p id="d1e586">Another informant, a male civil society informant in Zaranj, stressed unemployment
                                             problems for women: ‘Even though unemployment is a serious problem among men and women,
                                             the problem is much worse for women. While men can work in the private sectors, this
                                             may not be possible for women. The only common job that women are involved with is
                                             being a teacher. While we have many literate women, they are unemployed because no
                                             facilitation has taken place for women to be able to work in other government sectors
                                             and offices.’
                                             
                                          </p>
                                          <p id="d1e588">While unemployment affects the whole population in different ways, youth are the social
                                             group that is most affected. A youth CSO member voiced his concern: ‘Even though all
                                             age groups can face the same level of problems about security, we can say that youth
                                             may resort to illegal activities much faster than older people because they do not
                                             have life experience and have a lot of expectations.’

                                          <p id="d1e590">In our discussions with youth from the Kang district in Nimruz province, they reiterated
                                             similar experiences and sentiments, speaking about their frustrations, fears, hopes,
                                             and dreams for the future. The predominant challenge for all of them is unemployment;
                                             although some have part-time jobs, the salaries are insufficient to earn a living.
                                             As one youth expressed, the salaries do not allow them ‘to be able to study and become
                                             somebody’. They further reported that the lack of economic opportunities forces them
                                             to join extremist organisations, such as the Taliban, which offer economic incentives.
                                             Other problems they face are drug dealing, addiction, and abuse. Since Nimruz province
                                             borders Iran, drug dealing and cross-border smuggling are common and significant problems,
                                             and the primary reasons for drug dealing are poverty, peer pressure, and the desire
                                             to make money to pay intermediaries to emigrate.

                                          <p id="d1e592">Another major challenge that the youth face is the lack of proper recreational opportunities
                                             and facilities. The male respondents who spoke with us expressed their dreams of having
                                             a quality football field. For most, their ultimate aspirations are to earn an education
                                             and obtain employment, and their dream jobs are teaching, engineering, working as
                                             doctors, or joining the army. Many expressed the desire to marry and live happy, safe
                                             lives. For girls, dreams are different. They are permitted to study only through the
                                             elementary school level; to attend secondary schools, they must travel a significant
                                             distance, which their parents do not allow due to local cultural norms and the uncertain
                                             security situation. Even if they can obtain the necessary education, the only place
                                             they are allowed to work is the local girls’ school, which does not have the capacity
                                             to incorporate additional employees.

                                          <p id="d1e594">Most respondents mentioned unemployment, poverty, corruption, and drug abuse as the
                                             largest impediments to youth progress and the greatest contributors to insecurity.
                                             These were also mentioned as the root causes of young people taking to crime and joining
                                             extremist groups like Taliban or ISIS, as well as a major reason to be involved with
                                             the police. Police respondents in Nimruz also reiterated that unemployment, coupled
                                             with the use and sale of drugs, is the major source of crime, violence, and insecurity
                                             in the region. As one police officer told us,

                                                do anything to make ends meet. Of course, the majority want to make money to migrate.</i>

                                             Respondents from international and local NGOs in Swat, Peshawar, and Islamabad offered
                                             diverse responses and concerns regarding the sources of insecurity. The majority stated
                                             that unemployment is one of the leading sources of insecurity and is fuelling the
                                             worsening law-and-order situation that has made the country an insecure place for
                                             everyone from common people to state authorities. They stated that unemployment and
                                             poverty are the driving forces that cause people to adopt illegal and criminal means
                                             to survive.

                                          <p id="d1e608">The data collected in Swat illustrate multiple sources of insecurity in communities.
                                             The respondents frequently mentioned youth unemployment as the most dangerous source
                                             of insecurity because unemployment drives people to become involved in illegal activities,
                                             including murder, theft, kidnapping, carjacking, and petty crime. Swat locals also
                                             believe that those who join the Taliban are generally young people who are unemployed,
                                             excluded, neglected, and deprived in society and who are critical of the government
                                             and local landlords. Young men joining the Taliban and Al-Qaeda are common in both
                                             Afghanistan and Pakistan; the data collected from both offer similar findings regarding
                                             unemployment and the rise of Talibanisation and militancy. A civil society activist
                                             from Swat said, ‘Unemployment is the main source of insecurity in Pakistan. When people
                                             have no other option to feed their families, they involve themselves in theft, murder,
                                             and other street crimes.’ Another respondent who works with an international organisation
                                             based in Peshawar shared that ‘unemployment, poverty, and injustice are the main sources
                                             of insecurity in Pakistani society at local and regional levels. At a national level,
                                             unequal distribution of resources among provinces is the main source of insecurity
                                             for the people.’

                                          <p id="d1e610">However, a youth activist from Swat hoped for a better future for youth in the district

                                             <i>Unemployment, an apolitical attitude, and high illiteracy rates are the major sources
                                                of insecurity our youth are facing today. These sources of insecurities are related
                                                to those young men who do nothing and spend most of their time in leisure. Most of
                                                the youth from poor segments of society study in government schools and colleges,
                                                and the quality of education is gradually improving in Swat, and I assume the insecurities
                                                on the part of the youth are minimising day by day. The trend of madrassa is also
                                                gradually vanishing, particularly in the post-conflict scenario. People avoid sending

                                          <p id="d1e617">The impact of unemployment on young people can be disastrous, as it not only leads
                                             to corruption and drug abuse, but is also a primary cause of criminal activities,
                                             radicalisation, and violence. Pakistan must take advantage of its youth bulge in a
                                             positive way; however, to date, the state has ignored the growing radicalisation among
                                             youth, although the government has been striving to empower youth through multiple
                                             initiatives. For example, the previous government of the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz),
                                             or PML (N), began six initiatives to facilitate youth development to combat the soaring
                                             unemployment at a cost of Rs 20 billion [<a href="#R91">91</a>]. These initiatives include merit-based scholarships, laptop distribution, fee reimbursement,
                                             skill development programmes, free education for those in less-developed areas, and
                                             interest-free loans to young people [<a href="#R92">92</a>]. Such initiatives can begin to ameliorate young Pakistanis’ frustrations, grievances,
                                             and anxieties, which vary across regions and are complex in nature. For example, youth
                                             from the newly merged tribal districts of the erstwhile Federally Administered Tribal
                                             Areas, KP, and Baluchistan provinces have grievances with the state that are predominantly
                                             related to unemployment, unequal distribution of scarce resources, and lack of proper
                                             educational facilities. Additionally, their complaints and anger are directed towards
                                             the authorities, who are responsible for the forced disappearance of thousands of
                                             youths from tribal areas, the lack of inquiries into extrajudicial killings, the harsh
                                             treatment at check-posts across tribal areas, and the lack of compensation for human
                                             and property losses during military operations. They demand that the authorities establish
                                             a truth and reconciliation commission examining military operations in tribal areas

                                             people, rose to prominence in early 2018 in response to the above-mentioned grievances.
                                             Through it, youth seek peaceful methods to voice their complaints and to turn the

                                          <p id="d1e639">A recurring theme from our research sites was the impact of unemployment on youth
                                             and its consequences on livelihood security and personal security. One can say that
                                             unemployment is a universal concern for youth, though in conflict or post-conflict
                                             contexts, the consequences can be much more severe. The examples from Nimruz and Swat
                                             demonstrate that the vulnerabilities that young people face in pursuing their livelihoods
                                             is affected by the availability of adequate economic opportunities, access to education
                                             and local institutions, and political processes that influence decision-making. Livelihood
                                             security is not only affected by the above factors, but can also be threatened by
                                             poverty, corruption, and conflicts. The risk factors that accompany these insecurities
                                             are migration and drug abuse. In order to ensure a secure livelihood, youth in Nimruz
                                             migrate to Iran, while youth in Swat migrate to the big cities in Pakistan. However,

                                          <p id="d1e647">It is important to understand that the drivers of insecurity and challenges for youth
                                             are interconnected and create a vicious circle that young people have difficulty escaping.
                                             The nexus of migration and human trafficking is one such circle. This is the case
                                             not only in Nimruz, but also in other parts of the country; however, Nimruz, as a
                                             hub of migration and population movement in the country, has specific features that
                                             may lead to additional social challenges, including drug addiction. Due to its location,
                                             Nimruz is a principal port for human trafficking and drug smuggling to neighbouring
                                             countries. As one respondent commented,

                                             <i>Addiction is a significant problem for youth. Due to insecurity, drug cultivation
                                                is one of the most important means to make a living, and this cannot be stopped. Therefore,
                                                this has also become a problem in Nimruz.</i>

                                             least 2,000 people—mostly youth—illegally migrate to Iran. This has led to the widespread
                                             availability of drugs, which has made the capital city of this province highly attractive
                                             for addicts. Illegal migration and human trafficking as outcomes of unemployment and
                                             insecurity have become an attractive option for youth, and such strategies to mitigate
                                             the lack of livelihoods have consequences. A resident of a border district in Nimruz
                                             expressed feelings of despair and anger:

                                             due to the physical violence that their spouses direct toward them. As one female

                                                for women there are no facilities. In addition, most families will try to prevent

                                                police who run a complicated network that includes youth and children. They use children
                                                to sell drugs, and when they are addicted, they are used as a tool for begging. Drugs
                                                are so easy to get. If you are a newcomer in the city and you do not know anyone,
                                                you can easily find people through drugs.</i>

                                          <p id="d1e675">Our interviews at a rehabilitation centre in Zaranj revealed that 80% of young people
                                             became addicts while they were in Iran as illegal labourers or immigrants. Many of
                                             them were second-generation immigrants or job-seeking temporary migrants. The stories
                                             of the immigration–addiction nexus that we heard at the rehabilitation centre demonstrate
                                             the interconnectedness of such insecurities. One such story told by Karim (an alias)
                                             highlights the plight of young people:

                                             <i>Karim was the eldest of five children who came to Zaranj city to make a living so
                                                that he could support his family, who were poor. His family was from a nearby province.
                                                Karim’s family got in touch with an intermediary who promised work for Karim in Zaranj
                                                city. The family paid the intermediary some money for this service. In Zaranj, Karim
                                                was introduced to a drug gang involved in smuggling drugs across the border into Iran.
                                                Karim’s job was to smuggle drugs into Iran and sell them to drug couriers and labourers
                                                working there. For these services, he was paid—not very well but enough to send some
                                                (money) home to help his family. His family was not aware of the kind of work Karim
                                                was doing; they were under the impression that he had a decent job. Karim also mentioned
                                                how some border police and local police are involved in the drug racket scene. They
                                                work closely with the drug gangs and are in the pockets of these gangs. According
                                                to him, the police do not earn enough money, and this is the only way they can have
                                                more money to feed their families. As for Karim, he started stealing some money and
                                                small amounts of drugs and started taking drugs. He did this because the gang did
                                                not pay him well and he felt cheated for the work he was doing for them. The gang
                                                found out, beat him up, and threw him out on the streets. He lived on the streets
                                                mostly by stealing until a local NGO worker, who brought him to the rehabilitation
                                                centre, found him.</i>

                                             expectations are on their shoulders from the beginning. To feed their family or start
                                             a family, youth must earn money, and an attractive option is labour in Iran. It pays
                                             little, but after a year of tenacious work, one can earn enough to survive with their
                                             family in Afghanistan for a year before returning to Iran. Many of these youth undergo
                                             challenging hardships to reach Iran. For instance, many are caught in police crossfire
                                             or killed by criminals, and those who reach Iran work for as long as six months to
                                             pay the debt to their traffickers. Living in Iran illegally as a labourer or immigrant
                                             is stressful. Labourers live in communal rooms with many people in similar situations.

                                             a popular recreational activity among immigrant youth: they become drug addicts and
                                             are thus deported. Back in Afghanistan, they again face a bleak future with no job
                                             opportunities; with criminality being an immediate option, they are caught by the
                                             police and face imprisonment.

                                             Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) Afghanistan Drug Use Survey (2009), which mentions

                                             and 64. The survey further reveals that opium and heroin are two of the most common
                                             drugs abused by young people; moreover, Afghanistan and Iran have some of the highest
                                             numbers of users (UNODC, ‘World Drug Report 2012’). Both our data and other research

                                             worrisome for law enforcement agencies; the State Minister for the Interior of the
                                             present government has claimed that in Islamabad (Pakistan’s capital), 75% of young
                                             female and 45% of male students across various universities are addicted to ice [<a href="#R98">98</a>, <a href="#R99">99</a>]. Another related problem is theft by drug addicts, who commit crimes to finance
                                             their drug usage.

                                          <p id="d1e704">The majority of the respondents from local communities in Swat and Peshawar were of
                                             the viewpoint that drug addiction can be attributed to unemployment, rural–urban migration,
                                             and broken families. Particularly, the issue of how drug addiction among youth is
                                             on the rise can easily be observed in the Hayatabad and Karkhano (famous mega marketplace)
                                             areas of Peshawar, wherein drug addicts can be seen roaming around everywhere, including
                                             the residential streets, marketplaces, and deserted areas. The local communities consistently
                                             lodge complaints in the concerned police stations to eliminate these drug addicts
                                             because they are the primary source of various crimes in the areas including theft,
                                             abuse of children, and street crimes. The respondents shared that police have failed
                                             to tackle the problem because the number of drug addicts is on the rise and the government
                                             has no comprehensive policy to eliminate this serious social problem.

                                             negligence of the government, and the massive rural–urban migration due to military
                                             operations in the tribal areas and subsequent internal displacements are the main
                                             reasons for drug abuse among youth. The free roaming of these addicts has affected
                                             the local inhabitants of Hayatabad, Peshawar in many ways—for instance, theft, rising
                                             street crimes, child abuse, and stealing from residential areas during night time.
                                             Respondents suggested that it would be difficult to tackle the issue of drug abuse,
                                             including other youth issues, until and unless the police and other concerned departments
                                             come up with solutions to rural–urban migration or displacement and create livelihood
                                             opportunities for people living in rural areas that would eventually reduce the unemployment
                                             burden. On the other hand, the police are of the viewpoint that they are frequently
                                             monitoring the worsening situation but have failed to achieve the desired results
                                             due to lack of resources to rehabilitate the addicts and eliminate the primary sources
                                             behind this societal issue—that is, the massive rural–urban migration, the worse law-and-order
                                             situation in the adjacent tribal areas, rising inflation, and unemployment among the
                                             youth. Several incidents of murder, attempted murder, sexual abuse, theft, robberies,
                                             and snatching have been reported in Peshawar and its suburbs where the accused were
                                             found to be drug addicts.

                                             are over 4,000 drug addicts present, most of whom use heroin and ice drugs. The police
                                             and civil government are trying to address the issue and have established Darul Kafala
                                             (rehabilitation centre) for drug addicts [<a href="#R100">100</a>]. In both Peshawar and Swat, police—together with local communities, local public
                                             liaison councils (PLCs), and other committees—are trying hard to eliminate the menace
                                             of drug addiction from the society but failing to achieve desirable results. Both
                                             the respondents from the police and local communities argued that the reasons and
                                             sources of drug addiction (as mentioned earlier) are so strong and vibrant that despite
                                             applying available remedies to stop it, drug addiction is on the rise.

                                          <p id="d1e713">If we compare both the cases of Afghanistan and Pakistan, one of the main reasons
                                             for drug trade and abuse is linked to unemployment and poverty. As we have pointed
                                             out drug trade and the participation of youth in this trade is to support their livelihoods,
                                             and this makes them succumb to the use of drugs, which affects their insecurity. While
                                             the centre provides some relief to addicts, but it does not address other psychosocial
                                             insecurities that youth face. Most treatments at drug centres are medical in nature
                                             and little or no social counselling is provided to facilitate patients’ rehabilitation
                                             into society. Additionally, social stigma and family honour add to the mounting insecurity
                                             affecting youth, and the consequences of not reintegrating youth into society force

                                    <p id="d1e721">In the Nimruz case, the interviewed youth reported widespread disillusionment; they
                                       did not expect any positive developments in terms of decreasing corruption in the
                                       near future. As mentioned earlier, our informants in both case countries frequently
                                       reiterated this expectation. One considerable element of frustration, especially among
                                       the educated youth, was obtaining employment in either the public or private sector.
                                       Many voiced their frustration and anger at people who obtain jobs for which they are
                                       not qualified—either through their connections with people in high offices or through
                                       tribal affiliations. Moreover, even if people do get jobs, their position is not secure.
                                       Some must resort to corruption to keep their jobs intact. As one respondent mentioned,

                                       <i>It can also be said about job security. When someone gets a job, he or she must be
                                          careful because since there is corruption, his or her position can be sold to someone
                                          else. Since job security is so weak and the employee does not feel safe, he or she
                                          might resort to corruption to fill his or her pockets before candidates having better
                                          connections get the job, even if they are not qualified.</i>

                                       institutions is so prevalent that their trust in these institutions is minimal. They
                                       viewed their future in the country as hopeless, and many argued that the only possibility
                                       of a better life is to migrate out of the country. As one informant mentioned,

                                          at least around 2,000 people are leaving the country to Iran every day. Moreover,
                                          80% to 90% of them are youth. It is not only unemployment that makes them leave the

                                       conflict resolution, and interaction with government institutions. A civil society
                                       activist estimated that at least 75% of youth would prefer to consult <i>shura</i>, [<a href="#R101">101</a>] family elders, and youth networks for help and services. Furthermore, trust in the

                                       In this study, youth were especially angry that corruption had become an integral
                                       part of almost all interactions. One respondent stated, ‘Government positions are

                                       through its yearly survey, in which 81.5% of respondents considered corruption to
                                       be a substantial problem. The respondents’ experiences and interactions with different
                                       institutions highlighted the challenges of corruption: 67.5% of respondents experienced

                                       when receiving documents from the same; 65.1% encountered corrupt practices in their
                                       interactions with the Afghan National Police; and approximately 65% mentioned that

                                       study, which was conducted inside the Juvenile Rehabilitation Centre in Kabul, demonstrated
                                       that youth who have broken the law in different ways experience problems and challenges
                                       both during detention and after being released, and this factor can affect their future
                                       lives. Hall’s three-part study reveals existing vulnerabilities, risks, and barriers
                                       faced by youth. The first part provides reasons that they are imprisoned. Many children
                                       mentioned theft due to poverty and unemployment as a major factor for their imprisonment;
                                       ‘43% of the overall population are charged with theft/robbery, followed by moral crimes
                                       [<a href="#R103">103</a>] (14%). Other charges include drug offences, physical fights, the sale of alcohol,
                                       and trespassing. The most serious charges are of murder (13%) and sentences for threatening
                                       Afghanistan’s national security (12%), including terrorism charges’ ([<a href="#R102">102</a>], p.&nbsp;23). The children explained that on many occasions, the police either detained
                                       them without proper evidence or utilised them as scapegoats to locate the culprits
                                       involved in crime [<a href="#R82">82</a>]. Both studies also mention the impact of police harassment, violence, and corruption
                                       as an important factor contributing to youth insecurity.

                                       Peshawar and Swat regions of Pakistan with respondents from NGOs, INGOs, government
                                       officials, and police personnel clearly indicate that gender-based violence is considered
                                       one of many critical issues in Pakistan and that women are prone to experiencing various
                                       kinds of violence at the hands of male community members and have limited access to
                                       police protection and justice. Most women are not permitted to obtain education, work,

                                          drastically reduces women’s access to justice.</i>

                                    <p id="d1e825">Community involvement in policing services, as well as behavioural and attitudinal
                                       change training, is necessary to increase gender responsiveness and accountability
                                       in policing. Police in KP have introduced and implemented steps to ensure gender-responsive
                                       policing in the province. For example, enhancing the role of trained women in policing
                                       is an important component of managing the increasing trend in violence against women.
                                       One example is the establishment of women’s desks at police stations. For example,
                                       each police station must house a separate desk specifically to oversee female-related
                                       issues. A study of a UK-funded program found that the establishment of women’s desks
                                       at five police stations in Peshawar led to a 57% increase in the reporting of incidents
                                       in one year, commenting that it helped reduce the stigma of reporting such crimes:
                                       ‘For a woman to go to the police to make a complaint against a male in her household,
                                       that is a huge, huge step. The presence of a woman police officer softened the blow
                                       to the family. It made it acceptable for them to bring her back into the house’ [<a href="#R106">106</a>]. Unemployment and poverty also affect those women living in traditional societies,
                                       in which they only perform household chores. A community elder from Swat valley told
                                       us that, ‘unemployment and extreme poverty create dissonance among the family members,
                                       and ultimately, the women in the household have to bear physical violence and torture
                                       by the male members of the family’.

                                    <p id="d1e830">Additionally, some police stations across the study areas in Pakistan have separate
                                       women’s complaint cells, which have been effective in resolving cases of gender-based
                                       violence, although significant work remains, and reforms are needed to allow women
                                       and other vulnerable segments of society a respectable and equal place. This is part
                                       of a broader effort by both governmental organisations and NGOs to promote the enactment
                                       of new laws through legislation and research-based initiatives that improve police
                                       services. For example, the newly implemented KP Police Act of 2017 aims to depoliticise
                                       police and make them accountable to the elected institutions at both the district
                                       and provincial levels. Moreover, the establishment of PLCs, dispute resolution councils
                                       (DRCs), and citizen–police liaison councils (CPLCs) through the act can begin to close
                                       the widened gap between the people and the government [<a href="#R16">16</a>].

                                    <p id="d1e835">As we have seen from the above description, complex issues are at work when it comes
                                       to questions of livelihood challenges and human security at the local level. Those
                                       best positioned to understand the interplay of the issues are the communities themselves

                                    <p id="d1e840">Earlier sections have shown that livelihood opportunities are often limited in post-conflict
                                       areas. Especially for the younger population, this can lead to feelings of hopelessness
                                       and make them extremely vulnerable. It is also important to understand that conflict
                                       affects boys and girls differently. Enduring poverty and lack of economic prospects
                                       also leave youth vulnerable to participating in criminal activities as a livelihood
                                       strategy. They are more easily recruited into criminal groups and drug trafficking.
                                       In addition to providing an income, membership in organised crime groups can provide
                                       protection, safety, and an important sense of belonging and identity. As a result,
                                       authorities may stigmatise, chase, or beat them—whether randomly or in a targeted
                                       manner. Additionally, youth may cope with their situation by migrating or using drugs,
                                       which may lead to further insecurities. Another coping strategy may be radicalisation.
                                       Rather than assuming radicalisation to be solely a result of religious extremism,
                                       it can also come from poverty and social and political marginalisation. As our case
                                       examples show, the drivers of insecurity for the youth are interconnected, creating
                                       a vicious circle of vulnerability and risk. As pointed out earlier, research has revealed
                                       that police–youth relations in post-conflict contexts have their own challenges. The
                                       challenges of police insecurity, militarised and aggressive policing practices, abuse
                                       of police powers, corruption, and lack of trust and accountability tend to create
                                       a volatile relationship between police and youth. It becomes clear that issues of
                                       livelihood security and personal security are closely entwined, and there is a need
                                       to take an integrated approach to understanding these livelihood processes so that
                                       local communities might be in a better position to tackle their human security needs.
                                       It is also vital to understand how institutions, such as the police and government,
                                       can contribute to rather than threaten human security. For the police, there is the
                                       need to consider these issues through a civilian rather than a militarised or ‘force’
                                       approach of policing. This is where the advantages and strength of COP as a policing
                                       and preventive approach can be useful in creating this bridge of collaboration and
                                       engagement between law enforcement and local communities.

                                    <p id="d1e848">The previous sections have identified some key drivers of insecurities that youth
                                       face and how these are interlinked with policing issues. As previously stated, police–community
                                       relations in post-conflict contexts are problematic and challenging. The lack of trust
                                       in the police is a significant impediment to fostering their relations with the public.
                                       In this section, we examine how a shift towards COP might contribute towards bettering
                                       youth–police relations and how these relations can open spaces for better communication
                                       in addressing human security issues. In the first year of police reform in Afghanistan
                                       following the Bonn peace agreements in 2001, the focus of policing was on the training
                                       of police in military tactics and fighting insurgents, with very little focus on the
                                       broader set of insecurities that local communities experience.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e850">After realising the need for more civilian-focused police, the government of Afghanistan
                                       turned to COP, as voiced through the policy document Police-E-Mardumi (PeM)[<a href="#R107">107</a>], which defines the importance of ‘the cooperation between the people and the police’
                                       and highlights that those problems must be solved through close <i>cooperation</i> and <i>coordination</i>. The terms cooperation and coordination are broad concepts and recurring themes in
                                       many governmental documents that discuss community policing; initially a project,
                                       PeM has now become a permanent directorate within the MoI. The secondary units of
                                       PeM were extended in a few provinces in the country, and prior to the departure of
                                       one of its primary supporters, the European Union Police Mission (EUPOL), from Afghanistan,
                                       it had reached almost all provinces. According to the PeM protocol, the first step
                                       is to establish a <i>shura</i>-e police or police–public consultation <i>shura</i> (PCCS), which is utilised as a bridge between the police and the people. In the first
                                       meeting between the community and police, the concept of community policing is introduced.
                                       A similar unit was also established in the province of Nimruz [<a href="#R108">108</a>]. As a young NGO activist reiterated,
                                    </p>

                                       <i>When we think of police in Afghanistan, we think of war, of a warlord, and of a rough
                                          and tough person. This has caused a gap between people and the police. People think
                                          of police as a rough person who is fighting on the frontline and has no idea about
                                          working with the people and their problems. The PeM program tries to solve this problem.
                                          PeM is facilitating bringing police and people closer and conveys the message that
                                          the police are working for people’s safety and together they can work for better security.</i>

                                    <p id="d1e876">For instance, the PeM Community Policing Directorate has been given the green light
                                       to establish and operationalise 19 diverse councils in each of the police districts
                                       of Kabul, comprised of elders, religious persons, women, youth, influential community
                                       members, students, representatives of the educational directorate at the local level
                                       and the police commanders, and a liaison officer from the PeM directorate to address
                                       community issues. Issues that are taken up are land grabbing, unemployment, addiction
                                       problems, corruption, gender-based violence, school safety, criminal activities, and
                                       violence and issues regarding the police. Thirty percent of the membership in these
                                       <i>shuras</i> is reserved for women who come from civil society and schools and are known activists.
                                       Beyond the capital, PeM has expanded to include offices in 34 provinces of Afghanistan,
                                       with 337 PCCSs comprised of 13,480 members at provincial and district levels. The
                                       meetings are generally conducted in police buildings and are usually held twice each
                                       month. The people elect the members from their respective police districts.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e881">These <i>shuras</i> are important venues in which governmental organisations and police representatives
                                       can directly meet and consult community representatives to address security concerns.
                                       The youth and the larger community can express their grievances towards the government
                                       and the police to take a stand on many security-related issues. However, respondents
                                       mentioned to us that contact between the youth and police frequently occurs as personal
                                       contact and is needs-based. A young person who works for a CSO mentioned the following:
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e886">
                                       <i>We do not have regular meetings or procedures, but we have personal relationships
                                          and use them to connect with the police. For example, 25 days ago, we had a meeting
                                          with them (the police). We have a monthly meeting among the members of the civil society,
                                          and in one of the meetings, we discussed the problem of availability of drugs on the
                                          street and car theft. We decided to talk to the police about this. We contacted them,
                                          and then we set a meeting with the deputy chief of the police regarding these issues.
                                          We asked them to adopt measures based on our recommendation. After that, we saw some
                                          improvements, and some arrests were made.</i>

                                    <p id="d1e891">At the meeting, the police officer promised to address this issue. Following the meeting,
                                       some arrests were made, but according to some respondents, police efforts are inconsistent,
                                       and civil society must regularly push the police into action. When <i>shura</i> members return to their communities, the legitimacy that they gain from the involvement
                                       with PCCSs allows them to become part of the local or traditional conflict resolution
                                       mechanism in their neighbourhoods. These <i>shura</i> further act as a conflict resolution mechanism in which citizens can discuss the
                                       conflicts that they are facing and provide a bridge between the community and the
                                       police. Furthermore, the police gain public participation in security-related activities.

                                    <p id="d1e899">These PCCSs are important arenas for youth–police interactions. However, our research
                                       additionally reveals mixed feelings towards the police and, thus, different levels
                                       of trust between the people and the police at the community level in Nimruz province.
                                       While some respondents stated that they do not trust the police, others attributed
                                       the considerable level of security in their districts to the unity and cooperation
                                       between the police and the community; the difference depends on the modality of their
                                       interaction. An informant expressed his thoughts regarding the police as follows:
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e901">We can categorise the police into two groups. The first group is the low-ranking police,
                                       and the second is high-ranking police (officers). A few days ago, I was on my way
                                       to work, and I was stopped at a checkpoint. The police officer asked me if I was a
                                       government official. I said, ‘What is the difference, and why do you want to know?’
                                       He said, ‘I want to know’, and I said, ‘No, I am not working with the government.’
                                       He politely asked me if he could search the car. I allowed it, and after he was finished,
                                       I left. I told this to a friend of mine, who recalled an encounter he had witnessed:
                                       a while back, a police officer had stopped an unruly motorcycle rider, but the rider
                                       had not answered the officer’s questions. Instead, the rider had called the district’s
                                       chief of police, who was his own father. The police chief, upon hearing the story,
                                       both scolded and beat up the police officer because he had dared question his son.
                                       Now, if high-ranking officers behave in this way, what can you expect from low-ranking
                                       cops? This can discourage low-ranking police officers. Such behaviours affect trust.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e903">For people whose relatives are part of the police, the police are considered a friendly
                                       institution, while for others, the police are a corrupt organisation. When we asked
                                       our respondents if they have any regular communication with police, they said that
                                       they have nothing to communicate to them; they—the police—only work with smugglers
                                       and regulate the goods and oil smuggling across the border. Some respondents believed
                                       that people only interact with the police when they commit crimes; for example, they
                                       replied by saying, ‘Thank God we have nothing to do with the police. We don’t commit
                                       any crimes.’ For them, interaction with the police means something negative, and the
                                       police are viewed as interacting only with the corrupt. Although the respondents said,
                                       that their relationship with the police is good, they primarily meant that they have
                                       no real interaction because they have not done anything wrong.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e906">Levels of trust in the police are also low among women. According to a female civil
                                       society activist, there have been reports of corruption in the Female Response Units
                                       (FRUs) [<a href="#R109">109</a>] of Nimruz, causing women to prefer to speak with the Directorate of Women’s Affairs.
                                       This lack of trust can lead to further unemployment among women because few are willing
                                       to join the police due to fear of sexual harassment. Corruption and lack of trust
                                       in the police may additionally result in more women referring to traditional structures
                                       or CSOs. Based on our interviews, many women prefer to reach out to the Directorate
                                       of Women’s Affairs, women’s shelters, religious figures, CSOs, Community Development
                                       Councils (CDCs), and other entities. When we asked a civil society activist about
                                       the level of trust between women and police, she said,

                                          destroy the existing level of trust. For example, a few months ago, a policeman was
                                          pressing and threatening the women shelter’s administration that a woman living in
                                          the shelter should marry him because she did not have any guardian. This does not
                                          paint a good picture.</i>

                                    <p id="d1e916">The police have their own categories and opinions of youth. For example, in one of
                                       our interviews with an officer from Nimruz province, the respondent mentioned how
                                       the police both perceive and categorise them:
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e918">
                                       <i>I categorise them—youth—in three groups. The first group is the students who do not
                                          do anything wrong. The second group are the educated and bright youth who want to
                                          be part of government and support the government and the police, and the police have
                                          a good relationship with them. The third category are mostly youth in the villages
                                          and districts where the Taliban have influence. Some of them, although living under
                                          Taliban influence, have good intentions regarding the government, but there is another
                                          category that hates the government and supports the Taliban, Al-Qaeda, and ISIS. This
                                          last category is involved in a variety of crimes. They are constantly looking for
                                          opportunities to make quick money through all possible means, such as selling drugs
                                          or firearms, stealing, or informing.</i>

                                    <p id="d1e923">While many of these challenges are widespread and the police may not be involved in
                                       them directly, many of these issues bring the police into the picture; however, forums
                                       such as the PCCSs have created spaces for interactions and connections. It is important
                                       for youth to view the police as more than an institution that they visit after something
                                       negative has happened. As one youth participant in a police–community meeting stated,
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e925">
                                       <i>These meetings are a great way to interact with the police. Such meetings create a
                                          space for understanding our problems that we face and give us the opportunity to understand
                                          the police’s challenges. Many youth have a very bad picture of the police.</i>

                                       concerns of communities. However, these initiatives are not enough, as people still
                                       view the police with scepticism and mistrust. In both Afghanistan and Pakistan, civil
                                       society–driven initiatives have played a crucial part in promoting COP through joint

                              <p id="d1e935">In 2013, the international community, the UN, and a number of national NGOs allied
                                 in one of the largest community policing projects: the Afghanistan Democratic Policing
                                 Project. The project included many activities, among which were safety and school
                                 outreach activities aimed at youth. The purpose was to generate awareness among schoolchildren
                                 and youth regarding increasing public safety. The government of the Netherlands funded
                                 it, while the UN Office for Project Services managed the project, and UNAMA managed
                                 its implementation. Sayara, an international NGO and one of the implementation partners,
                                 trained the police to conduct safety briefings in schools and other community venues,
                                 including mosques. Police officers from the local community-policing unit visited
                                 schools to both inform and provide practical demonstrations to students regarding
                                 how to react in emergencies such as fires, traffic accidents, floods, and earthquakes,
                                 and they also addressed mine awareness and how to provide first aid. They also distributed
                                 school bags, pencil cases, lunch boxes, flashlights, and medical bags to the schools.
                                 Additionally, the local police discussed their role in serving the wider community.
                                 The safety outreach component covered 15 districts in seven provinces, with PeM teams
                                 contacting three schools or community groups per district. In many instances, the
                                 police and CSOs cooperated to conduct outreach programmes, which were delivered to
                                 schools in different provinces. Such participatory and cooperative efforts contributed
                                 to building positive trust-based relations among the police, CSOs, and the youth.
                                 In addition to Bamyan, other Afghan provinces—including Balkh, Baghlan, Ghor, Helmand,
                                 Kunduz, and Uruzgan—became part of this outreach programme [<a href="#R50">50</a>, <a href="#R110">110</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e943">Another example of police efforts to improve relations with local communities took
                                 place in Herat. In close cooperation with EUPOL and with financing from Deutsche Gesellschaft
                                 für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), the local PeM unit conducted a series of
                                 awareness campaigns for traffic safety in schools and colleges across the city, which
                                 were experiencing a rise in injuries and deaths among students due to traffic accidents.
                                 Police distributed stop signs, traffic paddles, and reflective vests, focusing on
                                 crosswalk safety training for students. Such initiatives may be small but are nonetheless
                                 important to building trust and confidence and improving interactions between young
                                 people and the police (Field interviews with EUPOL Staff, 2015).

                              <p id="d1e945">In a similar fashion, CSOs, sports bodies, and clubs in Kabul and a few provinces
                                 in the country were interested in improving relations with the police. The project
                                 comprised police and youth from diverse backgrounds who trained together, forming
                                 joint teams in either football or cricket to play in tournaments with other local
                                 teams. These projects became popular, opening avenues for cooperation in fighting
                                 crime, drugs, and terrorism (Field interviews with UNAMA Staff, 2015).

                              <p id="d1e947">For example, in Kabul, a women’s NGO successfully cooperated with police stations
                                 to train personnel to help victims of domestic violence. The training involved basic
                                 services for victims, legal aid, and knowledge regarding gender rights. Additionally,
                                 the NGO assisted the police in providing safe shelters for victims, as their stations
                                 did not have capacity for that project (UNAMA informant, 2015).

                              <p id="d1e949">A private NGO founded in 1996, PARSA, works directly with several groups in Afghanistan.
                                 In our discussion with the head of PARSA and two members of the organisation, we were
                                 told that they participate in various projects with the most vulnerable people in
                                 society, such as destitute women and orphaned children, to provide economic programmes
                                 for women living in shelters. An important project that PARSA re-established in 2008
                                 is the Scout programme for youth. The Scout movement was established in 1931 and was
                                 active until 1970; however, due to various conflicts affecting the country, it lost
                                 momentum. Governmental support and financial assistance from international organisations
                                 enabled the movement to slowly gain popularity among the youth in 2008. Officials
                                 mentioned to us that PeM worked with the Scouts on two projects: community outreach
                                 and community service programmes. PeM representatives attend the Scoutmaster’s programme
                                 to develop outreach skills in youth and then teach and train Scouts on safety measures
                                 regarding fire, traffic, first aid, and mines. Scouts then teach other youth under
                                 the guidance of PeM, planning community service programmes that involve planting trees,
                                 cleaning schools, and removing trash. In cooperation with PeM, Scout programmes provide
                                 opportunities for those who are at risk of being recruited into extremism. Scouts
                                 contact the communities through PeM, calling on community elders—which include <i>maliks</i>, <i>shura</i> members, and District Development Authorities (DDA) members—to introduce their programmes.
                                 There are roughly 2,500 Scouts in the country, 30% of whom are girls. In our discussion
                                 with the head of PeM in 2018, we were told that the relationship between Scouts and
                                 PeM is based on ongoing projects: when the project ends, the relationship will become
                                 an ad-hoc one, which means that the police will contact the Scouts if there are programmes
                                 (per field interviews conducted in 2016).
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e957">In Nimruz, the Scout programme is conducted with the help of and coordination between
                                 PeM and the Directorate of Education. There are 680 Scouts in Nimruz province, and
                                 PeM trains them on school safety programmes, police responsibilities, and their role
                                 in the community. These Scouts are then assigned to teach other students about the
                                 school outreach programmes and the police. According to a civil society activist who
                                 participated in some PeM shura meetings in Nimruz, ‘these meetings could provide a
                                 platform to remove the gap between the public and the police’. For example, police
                                 are depicted as a ‘warlike institution rather than being people oriented; therefore,
                                 these meetings may allow young people specially to view the police differently. Furthermore,
                                 these meetings have become a venue for young people to meet with each other and create
                                 a network.’
                                 
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e959">The cooperation among youth, international agencies, CSOs, and police is important
                                 for creating conditions for COP to be effective in minimising citizens’ insecurity.
                                 These relationships can improve knowledge transfers among youth, police, international
                                 agencies, and CSOs. The participatory nature of such projects offers channels for
                                 communication and cooperation. Coyne and Nyborg (2020) highlighted the advantages
                                 of a civilian-centred approach towards police–community participation. Such a cooperative
                                 approach provides an incentive for the police to improve their behaviour and performance
                                 towards the community and creates a platform for police accountability. This type
                                 of grassroots approach is uncontroversial, and it creates an alternative vision of
                                 policing in which communities and police cooperate to overcome insecurity. The strength
                                 of a civilian-based approach is the wide variety of knowledge, skills, and connections
                                 that it offers, which is important for creating locally sustainable solutions to security
                                 challenges. The participatory and dialogic nature of such involvement opens avenues
                                 for implementing COP practices in a sustained manner [<a href="#R6">6</a>].

                                       Pakistan’s independence in 1947, they were not successful until the Police Order of
                                       2002—promulgated by the then-president of Pakistan and providing protection under
                                       the constitution in the 17th Amendment Act of 2003—replaced the Police Act of 1861.

                                       along its borders and internally—sparked renewed interest in improving the relationship
                                       between the police and communities as a way to ensure peace and development in Pakistan.
                                       Combined with the devolution of political power to the provinces, a space was created
                                       for local police reform processes. Notably, the KP government introduced and implemented
                                       the KP Police Act of 2017, which is the most advanced reform effort in the country.

                                       through community-oriented and gender-responsive policing. One primary purpose of
                                       the KP Police Act of 2017 was to bridge the widened gap between the community and
                                       police, allowing them to work in close coordination to fight crime. While not called
                                       community-oriented policing per se, the components and intentions of the Act of 2017
                                       are closely aligned with the main philosophy of COP. And while few respondents from
                                       KP were aware of the term COP during our fieldwork in Pakistan, it was well known
                                       and promoted by governmental and police officials serving at higher levels. In an
                                       interview, a former director general of the National Police Bureau Islamabad defined
                                       COP as an effort,

                                       the public and the police, including the establishment of DRCs and PLCs. These councils
                                       are organised at the district level and consist of 21 members selected from local
                                       communities, including civil service officers, lawyers, educators, youth, and other

                                    <p id="d1e978">PLCs in particular are important arenas for improving relations between youth and
                                       police. In most of KP province, the police are working to incorporate young people
                                       in various societal events to improve their mutual relations. Recently, the police
                                       collaborated with UNDP and other civil departments to introduce PLCs in 10 conflict-affected
                                       districts of KP province, including six districts of Malakand Division: Swat, Malakand,
                                       Buner, Shangla, Dir Lower, Dir Upper and Chitral, Bannu, Kohat, and Dera Ismail Khan.
                                       These councils comprise 30 members: 70% are local governmental representatives—mostly
                                       elected young men—and 30% are reputable individuals from the local community [<a href="#R111">111</a>]. Data from the fieldwork in KP reveal that although these forums can, in theory,
                                       include young women as well, they were in practice only open to male members of the
                                       community because the prevailing culture and traditions did not allow women to participate
                                       in any forums alongside men. The exception is in areas where CSOs have formed female
                                       PLCs as a part of their competence building activities with the police.

                                    <p id="d1e983">The PLCs organise events to provide platforms for both youth and the police to easily
                                       interact, play games, and discuss local issues. For example, the Rahimabad police
                                       station in Swat and areas under its jurisdiction organises monthly cricket matches
                                       between the two groups. The most important factor in these games lies in the post-match
                                       ceremonies, during which the local community expresses their grievances to the police
                                       in a friendly environment. These complaints typically concern decision-making in developmental
                                       projects, the harsh behaviour of security agencies, the provision of employment opportunities,
                                       education, and healthcare services, and other issues. Most respondents appreciated
                                       that such initiatives may improve police–community relationships as well as occupy
                                       the youth with constructive activities and provide hope of ownership in confronting
                                       local matters. Locals define these PLCs as a form of community-oriented policing because
                                       the aims and objectives of this initiative contribute to the COP philosophy. A youth
                                       respondent from Kabal, Swat, addressed their importance:

                                       <i>I think interactions between youth and police should happen on a regular basis. I
                                          prefer the involvement of the youth in regional matters as it is seen fruitful by
                                          many. Numerous initiatives for bridging the gap and creating partnerships between
                                          the police and the community have been and are still being taken up so far, but we
                                          don’t see considerable results because eventually such initiatives are influenced
                                          by the politicisation of the programmes or projects, sometimes by influential local
                                          politicians or sometimes by police personnel. True sincerity can really be seen in
                                          such endeavours. To bring peace and harmony in the community by partnering, the police–community
                                          (relationship) needs strong leadership on the part of youth, commitment from the police

                                          the army. However, I can hopefully say that the initiative of PLCs has the potential

                                       that they are frustrated with the role the police assume in these areas. For example,
                                       respondents complained that the police confront young activists in an unlawful manner
                                       with an iron fist and act on orders from the Pakistani army and intelligence agencies.

                                       lists. The youth argue that such behaviour from the police expands the gap between
                                       them and the youth and that the various initiatives for bringing police and youth

                                          never be misguided by religion.</i>

                                    <p id="d1e1021">Since the beginning of 2018, youth in Pashtun-dominated areas—especially in the newly
                                       merged tribal districts as well as in the adjacent cities of Bannu, Karak, Dera Ismail
                                       Khan, Peshawar, and parts of Baluchistan—have been actively demanding their due rights
                                       from the government and armed forces of Pakistan. During the fieldwork in Peshawar,
                                       we further learnt that youth (social activists) are more frightened of the state’s
                                       security agencies than of militants. Young people hailing from the newly merged tribal
                                       districts expressed their views that, on the one hand, the youth movement is providing
                                       people with the courage to claim their basic human rights and justification of the
                                       military operations conducted in tribal areas since 9/11; on the other hand, they
                                       frequently face harassment, arrest, abduction, and targeted killings from security
                                       agencies, and police are at the forefront of these problems. They criticised the role
                                       that the police have assumed in post-conflict areas; for example, the respondents
                                       complained that police confront young activists in an unlawful way with an iron fist
                                       and acting on orders from the Pakistani army and intelligence agencies. The youth
                                       argued that such behaviour from police can expand the gap between them and the youth,
                                       jeopardising the initiatives for bringing them together. In an interview with the
                                       director general of the National Police Bureau in Islamabad Pakistan (NPB), we were
                                       told the following:

                                       <i>NPB is developing curricula for police schools; for example, they will start the initiative
                                          in the National Police Academy Islamabad. The institution will bring together people
                                          from all segments of society: media, community elders, politicians, police, and academia
                                          in order to make COPs an effective tool to bring harmony, peace, and prosperity for
                                          all. International communities are also striving to incorporate COPs in police departments
                                          and make them an effective tool that could bring police and communities together.
                                          Various national and international organisations are working closely with police and
                                          other departments. UNDP, Coffey International, Department for International Development
                                          (DFID), UKAID, Centre for Peace and Development Initiatives (CPDI), and Home and Tribal
                                          Affairs Department KP are working together to incorporate COPs in the system. Various
                                          workshops and seminars have been conducted with the police, local administration,
                                          the prison and prosecution department, and local communities in order to sensitise
                                          the idea of COPs.</i>

                                    <p id="d1e1028">In this respect, the PLCs are not the only option for community–police interaction.
                                       Section 168 of the Police Order of 2002 provided for the establishment of CPLCs to
                                       perform certain functions that could lead to institutionalising COP in Pakistan [<a href="#R112">112</a>]. A CPLC is ‘a non-political statutory institution, operationally independent and
                                       managed by dedicated and concerned citizens offering their honorary services to bridge
                                       the gap between communities and police’ [<a href="#R113">113</a>]. The foremost difference between CPLCs and PLCs is that the former are formal and
                                       the latter are informal in exercising their activities regarding police–community
                                       relations; however, the aims and objectives of both are to establish police–community
                                       partnerships to combat crime and resolve societal issues.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e1036">CPLCs are considered another initiative that can make the police and youth collaborate
                                       to curb crime and violence. To date, CPLCs are functional in Karachi and Lahore [<a href="#R93">93</a>] Provincial Public Safety (PPS) and the Police Complaint Commission (PCC) in KP are
                                       attempting to establish CPLCs in each district of the province, but previous governments
                                       in KP have thus far ignored this requirement. The provincial government of KP, however,
                                       is planning to initiate a CPLC soon, and CPLCs are one of their prime objectives [<a href="#R114">114</a>]. Three women are to be included in each committee, and members have been nominated.
                                       Initially, no specific number of members was legally specified for the liaison committee,
                                       but authorities decided to restrict it to 10. The CPLCs are not only to work as trust-building
                                       bodies but also to bridge the communication gap between the public and the police.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e1044">The police in KP now consider youth to be a means to fight radicalisation, crime,
                                       and drug addiction, and they engage youth representatives in interactive sessions
                                       with officers from across the province to encourage them to fight crime [<a href="#R115">115</a>]. PLCs are playing an important role in this interactive engagement. These interaction
                                       sessions are held as meetings between police personnel and local youth, awareness
                                       sessions across districts, and workshops to build capacity in both police and youth.
                                       These sessions are useful for sensitising youth on various police initiatives such
                                       as DRCs, police access services, police assistance lines, and efforts to improve police
                                       behaviour at a police station level. Such cooperative efforts between the police and
                                       civil society can further build and strengthen trust relations among various actors.
                                       Since they also allow police to better understand the insecurities that the youth
                                       face, the police respond in a more appropriate manner that builds trust rather than
                                       threatening it.

                                    <p id="d1e1050">Notably, Cuesta et al. (2007), Peters et al. (2003), and Bihler et al. (2015) have
                                       discussed the importance of participatory grassroots projects in reducing violence,
                                       crime, and gang activities among young people in their research from Cali in Colombia,

                                       respectively. Through positive intervention programmes and social development activities,
                                       such as training workshops, family meetings, festivals, sports activities, church

                                       from the private sector, youth can be lured away from crime and violence. The cooperation
                                       and collective participation of citizens, CSOs, police, the justice system, and local
                                       authorities are key factors in such preventive work [<a href="#R116">116</a>, <a href="#R117">117</a>, <a href="#R118">118</a>]. Similarly, Moser and van Bronkhorst (1999) mentioned the importance of community
                                       policing programmes, such as implementing after-school sports activities, hosting
                                       homework clubs run by community police officers, and picking up school dropouts and
                                       taking them to school, which can enhance trust building between the community and

                              <p id="d1e1067">As we have discussed, in both Nimruz and KP provinces, some primary drivers of insecurity
                                 are unemployment, poverty, drug abuse, corruption, and a host of societal challenges
                                 that youth confront daily. In Nimruz province, addiction is viewed as the predominant
                                 enemy of the youth. Many of our respondents, both young men and women, stressed that
                                 unemployment leads to illegal migration and drug abuse, which further leads to the
                                 destruction of youth’s lives in the community, and many families have been haunted
                                 by this vicious circle. Interviews with young people revealed similar histories of
                                 poverty, unemployment, migration, and drug abuse as central to people’s everyday experiences.
                                 Migration, drug abuse, and drug peddling are substantial challenges to the local inhabitants
                                 and the police. Other risk factors that affect youth and increase pressure in their
                                 lives are different forms of urban violence, such as theft, gangs, terrorist attacks
                                 or bombings, and police harassment.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e1069">Our data show how livelihood security and personal security are closely interconnected.
                                 Both cases show that drug abuse is complex. One of the major reasons for youth involvement
                                 in the drug trade is to support their livelihoods; however, they also succumb to the
                                 use of drugs, which again affects their security. Livelihood security is paramount
                                 to understanding the interconnected nature of drug trade and abuse. The cases show
                                 how drugs become coping strategies for the vulnerabilities that youth face, namely
                                 unemployment and corruption, and how these in turn become risk factors with law-and-order
                                 issues between communities and the police.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e1071">As we have argued, the factors that drive young people to vulnerability, exclusion,
                                 and frustration are common to both young women and men; however, young girls and women
                                 face additional challenges that increase their vulnerability. Understanding the gender
                                 dynamics within the context of insecurity is critical. Our case studies demonstrate
                                 that the nature of insecurity that young women face is both public and private. In
                                 the public sphere, young girls face restrictions from family members, who prevent
                                 them from attending school or force them to leave school at an early age. The reasons
                                 vary from fear of walking alone to school to dangers of sexual harassment or being
                                 kidnapped. For young women, employment is another significant challenge; many women
                                 feel the pressure of sexual harassment from their male colleagues and become targets
                                 of threats and attacks in their workplaces, thereby forcing them to either quit or
                                 find another job.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e1073">In both Afghanistan and Pakistan, gender-based violence in the private sphere is a
                                 primary cause of insecurity among young girls and women, and issues related to young
                                 girls, women, and marriage are at the heart of the family or tribe’s honour and dignity.
                                 Harmful practices, including child marriage, baad (exchange of young girls in conflict
                                 resolution cases), honour killings, and forced marriages, significantly limit the
                                 participation of young girls and women in many spheres of life. Young boys are also
                                 exposed to violence through the practice of bacha bazi, where rich and powerful men
                                 and even the police sexually exploit poor, young boys caught in the net of poverty,
                                 family pressure, desire for economic gain, cultural traditions, violence, and abuse.
                                 Cultural norms of honour and shame that particularly pervade women’s daily lives do
                                 not allow them or their family members to seek advice or report cases to external
                                 institutions such as the police. Furthermore, people either do not trust the police
                                 or view them as corrupt; hence, few seek their assistance [<a href="#R119">119</a>].

                              <p id="d1e1078">Youth and police relations in many countries are often complex and problematic, as
                                 police perceive youth as either perpetrators or victims of crime. In post-conflict
                                 settings, these relations are additionally difficult, as societal trust is brittle.
                                 In both Afghanistan and Pakistan, police–community relations are challenging, and
                                 trust is low. Many challenges that we have discussed regarding youth—whether economic,
                                 social, cultural, or political—are closely interconnected to issues of safety and
                                 security and, hence, are linked to law-and-order issues and police involvement. Despite
                                 these difficulties, maintaining peace and stability with the young community depends
                                 on the police understanding youth insecurities and responding appropriately to their
                                 safety and security needs. Without community involvement, police efforts towards trust
                                 building and support are futile. COP is an important policing approach that we have
                                 discussed. The operationalisation of COP lies in building trust and interacting with
                                 communities in a collaborative manner; its strength is in its responsiveness and accountability
                                 and in the engagement of communities to determine appropriate and sustainable local
                                 solutions.

                              <p id="d1e1080">Our field data from KP province demonstrate that PLCs are an important COP initiative
                                 in which police and youth meet to discuss their mutual concerns regarding safety,
                                 security, developmental issues, and police misconduct in a safe space. Games and sports
                                 become important arenas for such mutual interactions. CPLCs are another such initiative
                                 in which youth and police connect to discuss issues pertaining to conflict resolution,
                                 political mobilisation, unemployment, crime, terrorism, and radicalisation. The police
                                 in KP have also introduced DRCs—alternative dispute resolution forums in which victims,
                                 offenders, and the community meet to discuss and provide reconciliation to the concerned
                                 parties in a dispute. However, a significant drawback for many of these initiatives
                                 is that the participation of young women is limited. Nevertheless, such initiatives
                                 are important in enabling communities and the police to interact without hostility,
                                 build trust, and mutually support each other to create safety and security in local
                                 environments.

                              <p id="d1e1082">In Afghanistan, the establishment of PCCSs is an important step in creating a meeting
                                 place in which the police and community members can interact without tension. As previously
                                 discussed, the <i>shuras</i> are key meeting venues for the police and government representatives to meet with
                                 community members and discuss issues concerning safety, security, and development.
                                 For youth, they provide opportunities to communicate their worries and problems to
                                 both governmental officials and the police. Within the context of human security and
                                 COP, FRUs and PWCs are important bodies contributing to justice and security for women
                                 in a small way.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e1087">The role of CSOs in building bridges of trusting relationships between youth and the
                                 police is crucial if COP is to be effective and successful in post conflict contexts.
                                 Our case examples from Afghanistan and Pakistan illustrate the importance of CSOs’
                                 successful participation with the local police in various community-based projects
                                 that enhance fruitful partnerships, relations, and trust for future collaborations.
                                 Projects aimed at young children and youth, such as safety outreach programmes; first
                                 aid traffic safety instructions; the dangers of mines, floods, and earthquakes; joint
                                 sports programmes; and football and cricket matches are some of the activities that
                                 open lines of communication and mutual understanding regarding issues of safety and
                                 security. Serious subjects, including criminal activities, drugs, extremism, and terrorism,
                                 in which the youth are susceptible to becoming involved, are addressed in a non-threatening
                                 manner. Similarly, youth share their problems, challenges, and grievances with the
                                 police. The participatory nature of these projects simplifies cooperation and knowledge
                                 transfer. An area for future research, especially in post-conflict settings, is the
                                 role of civil society–driven initiatives in community–police engagement.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e1089">By keeping in mind the fragile relations between the police and citizens in post-conflict
                                 societies, such a grassroots approach can go a long way in creating small steps for
                                 cooperation and trust building. In Nimruz and KP, PLCs, CPLCs, PeM, and PCCSs are
                                 high-impact participatory arenas for facilitating dialogue and cooperation among all
                                 stakeholders. The primary challenge is that this effort must be viewed as a priority
                                 and an important aspect of COP.

                              <p id="d1e1091">A common thread that has been voiced throughout this paper is the interconnectedness
                                 of the insecurities that youth are exposed to in these case countries and in post-conflict
                                 societies more generally. We have examined how young people’s lives are shaped by
                                 their access to economic advantages and opportunities, as well as to education and
                                 health services, illustrating how these influence their lives. Additionally, we have
                                 addressed how they can actively participate in processes, including policing, voice
                                 their concerns, and be part of the decision-making that affects their lives. Our data
                                 present how young people discuss the challenges that they meet and what they require
                                 to better their livelihoods; as we have discussed, most of these challenges concern
                                 security issues and connect to broader aspects of human security. Moreover, the data
                                 demonstrate that livelihood security issues are closely connected to personal security
                                 and the effects on communities of young women and men and that the police are critical
                                 in contributing to human security rather than being a source of insecurity.
