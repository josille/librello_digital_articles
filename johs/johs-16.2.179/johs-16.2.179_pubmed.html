                  <p class="first" id="d1e91">Youth are the backbone of any nation, and they are decisive in its development or
                     destruction. A considerable portion of the population in both Afghanistan and Pakistan
                     consists of youth. This paper discusses the impacts of unemployment, poverty, drug
                     abuse, corruption, conflicts, and extremism on the experiences of young people in
                     these countries. Vulnerabilities can become risk factors that, in turn, can increase
                     the likelihood of youth being involved with the police. Although vulnerability and
                     insecurity are common to both young women and men, girls and young women face additional
                     challenges that increase their vulnerability to insecurities, such as gender-based
                     violence. This article details how livelihood and personal insecurities are closely
                     intertwined and further considers how these insecurities involve the police in one
                     way or another. It argues that local community-oriented police initiatives and civil
                     society organisation contributions can increase cooperation between youth and law
                     enforcement agencies in addressing these challenges in a collaborative and trustful
                     manner.

               <!-- named anchor --></a><h2 class="main-title">1.- Introduction</h2>
            <p id="d1e108">‘The future belongs to our youth’—these famous words by Nelson Mandela hold true for
               many emerging and developing countries. Seventy percent of the population in emerging
               and developing countries are youth [<a href="#R1">1</a>]. The World Bank’s Development Report (2011) highlights the problem of youth participation
               and calls for young people to be given more significant opportunities to participate
               in social life. If this does not occur, then the resulting frustration could lead
               to societal apathy and an increasing propensity for violence, the economic and social
               costs of which would be a predominant barrier to development. A process of this kind
               could lead to the destabilisation of the country in the medium to long term [<a href="#R2">2</a>]. While many scholars have considered that the rising number of young people drives
               the development of post-conflict countries, others have warned of a demographic disaster
               if increased attention is not placed on the concerns of youth, especially regarding
               youth unemployment, livelihood, education, and marginalisation [<a href="#R3">3</a>]. The consequences of ignoring these issues could be severe—particularly if the energies
               of the youth are channelled towards violence, extremism, and destruction. Such a path
               could further affect youth’s trust in governmental institutions, such as the police,
               which ensures security and safety, and it is paramount that their relationship with
               citizens is based on trust and rule of law.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e119">In post-conﬂict societies, issues of personal and livelihood security are often intimately
               intertwined. Therefore, there is a need to understand how local communities manage
               the broader set of issues comprising human security, which focuses on two main areas:
               ‘freedom from fear’ and ‘freedom from want’. It focuses on broader aspects of security,
               namely economic, food, health, environmental, personal, community, and political aspects,
               and on the different forms of interlinked insecurity that people experience [<a href="#R4">4</a>]. In its broadest sense, the term concentrates on human vulnerability, encompassing
               threats of all kinds [<a href="#R5">5</a>]. ‘A human security framework puts people’s security in focus, and opens for an analysis
               of not only multiple sources of insecurity faced by communities, but also diversity
               of civil institutions (governmental and non-governmental) which together can address
               people’s diverse security needs [<a href="#R6">6</a>]. Some factors that contribute to the risks and vulnerabilities of youth, such as
               lack of livelihood, insufficient access to quality education, poor health, and gender
               challenges, can lead young people to violence, exclusion, criminal gangs, and violent
               extremism. These insecurities are connected to law enforcement issues to varying degrees;
               in other words, the police are actively involved in confronting such law-and-order
               issues in and between communities. Paradoxically, the police can themselves be a primary
               cause of insecurity for the local population through violent behaviour and corruption,
               consequently creating a trust gap between law enforcement and citizens. For example,
               research from Latin American countries has revealed some of the challenges of police
               insecurity, namely militarised policing, corruption, police abuse of powers, lack
               of accountability, and violation of human rights [<a href="#R7">7</a>, <a href="#R8">8</a>, <a href="#R9">9</a>]. Likewise, research from Africa has shown similar cases of police aggression, corruption,
               and lack of trust as important causes of citizen insecurity [<a href="#R10">10</a>, <a href="#R11">11</a>, <a href="#R12">12</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e149">Considering the importance of addressing insecurities faced by youth and the need
               to build trust in post-conflict contexts, the question arises as to how citizens can
               improve their cooperation and trust the police. One line of approach is community-oriented
               policing (COP), which recognises close community partnerships and cooperation for
               providing safety and security, as well as building trust between the police and communities
               [<a href="#R13">13</a>]. COP strives for a paradigm shift from the exclusion to the inclusion of common
               people from policing, where common people are afforded a visible role [<a href="#R14">14</a>]. COP is both an organisational strategy and a philosophy that allows the community
               and the police to work together to solve problems of crime and disorder in novel ways
               and to ensure the safety and security of the public. The idea has two central components:
               transforming the practice and methods of policing, and taking steps to establish a
               relationship between the public and the police [<a href="#R15">15</a>, <a href="#R16">16</a>]. Most importantly, COP can facilitate a platform for youth to address their insecurities.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e163">Rich and varied literature exists concerning youth violence, conflict, and exclusion;
               however, one under-researched area concerns the preventive measures employed to overcome
               the various insecurities that youth face through the institution of COP. Therefore,
               this paper focuses on the following crucial questions: what insecurities do youth
               in Afghanistan and Pakistan face, and how do these insecurities affect their relations
               with the police? How can COP be useful in creating a better understanding between
               police and youth? Based on field research and desk studies from two case countries,
               Afghanistan and Pakistan, we explore the factors that lead to insecurities and how
               understanding their interconnectedness is fundamental to meaningfully address the
               day-to-day concerns of Afghan and Pakistani youth. The scope of the current paper
               is limited and does not represent the whole population of youth in either Afghanistan
               or Pakistan. We further understand that the current paper may pose more questions
               than it answers, but it does what a scientific paper should: answer some questions
               and expose more.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e165">The article is structured as follows. We begin with a brief literature review of youth
               insecurities, focusing on a broader human security perspective including discussion
               of gender and youth–police relations. The methodology section explains the methods
               utilised to study our research questions in the difficult context of Afghanistan and
               Pakistan. We then present our findings on the key drivers of insecurities and exclusions
               experienced by youth in our two case countries. This is followed by a discussion on
               COP activities in relation to youth in each of the case countries, including discussions
               on the role of civil society organisations (CSOs) and police-citizen bodies in building
               relationships and trust between citizens and police through their participatory dialogic
               approach. The article concludes with important lessons on building sustainable youth–police
               relations in post-conflict countries.

               <p id="d1e173">Several bodies of literature are relevant in exploring youth insecurities and police
                  relations—for example, youth exclusion, livelihoods and radicalisation, gender, and
                  policing literature. The theoretical discussions regarding youth and insecurities
                  have centred around three major perspectives: the youth bulge theory, greed or opportunity
                  perspectives, and grievance perspectives. The discourse within youth bulge perspectives
                  has argued that a growing young population, coupled with unemployment, lack of economic
                  opportunities, corruption, exclusion, marginalisation, and weak and oppressive political
                  systems, provokes young people into violence and conflict, thereby causing a threat
                  to peace, stability, and security [<a href="#R17">17</a>, <a href="#R18">18</a>]. However, others have criticised this view and warned against simplistic equations
                  among youth, armed conflict, and violence [<a href="#R19">19</a>, <a href="#R20">20</a>]. Advocates of the greed or opportunity perspective have argued that young people
                  are prone to join armed or violent groups that engage in violence, as doing so provides
                  incentives in the form of material and protective benefits [<a href="#R21">21</a>, <a href="#R22">22</a>]. The avenues for joining such groups attract youth who are illiterate, poor, and
                  desperate to fight their way out of poverty. Grievance perspectives state that youth
                  participation in violent conflicts is due to various factors that cause deprivation
                  and exclusion [<a href="#R23">23</a>, <a href="#R24">24</a>]. In-depth studies from West Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia [<a href="#R23">23</a>] have demonstrated that horizontal inequalities comprising ethnic, religious, or
                  racial disparities affect the political, economic, and cultural status of people and
                  thereby become a contributing factor in violent conflicts. Socioeconomic inequalities
                  coupled with the lack of political participation can mobilise young people to engage
                  in violent activities. These theoretical perspectives shed light on the different
                  causes of youth insecurities, each highlighting different variables for youth vulnerabilities.
                  Although demography is an important variable in understanding various insecurities,
                  other factors—such as employment, lack of adequate livelihood opportunities, poverty,
                  illiteracy, access to education, and corruption—also contribute to the risks and vulnerabilities.
                  Our study from Afghanistan and Pakistan demonstrates that the factors that influence
                  youth marginalisation and vulnerabilities are interconnected, and understanding them
                  holistically is important.

               <p id="d1e206">Another relevant body of literature examines how poverty, lack of adequate job opportunities,
                  and prevalent socioeconomic conditions can force young people to pathways of extreme
                  radicalisation [<a href="#R2">2</a>, <a href="#R25">25</a>, <a href="#R26">26</a>, <a href="#R27">27</a>]. Various studies have identified a clear link between poor socioeconomic conditions
                  and lack of livelihood opportunities that tempt young people to join the Taliban and
                  ISIS in Afghanistan, and numerous researchers have observed a similar link in the
                  case of tribal areas of Pakistan [<a href="#R28">28</a>, <a href="#R29">29</a>, <a href="#R30">30</a>, <a href="#R31">31</a>, <a href="#R32">32</a>, <a href="#R33">33</a>, <a href="#R34">34</a>]. For example, a study from Balk province in Afghanistan mentioned that ‘the most
                  frequent cited drivers of insecurity were unemployment and poverty, which were described
                  as being an ‘‘open door for the Taliban’’’ [<a href="#R35">35</a>]. Another study noted how ‘70% of young Taliban fighters in Afghanistan fight for
                  money and not for ideology’ [<a href="#R36">36</a>]. As Bergen and Waldman (2014) explained, for young, unemployed people, joining insurgent
                  groups is an ‘honourable way’ to feed their families [<a href="#R37">37</a>]. In addition, as Matusitz pointed out, ‘under circumstances of weak governance,
                  unbridled corruption, and human rights violations, terrorism will blossom. This is
                  a recurring theme’ [<a href="#R38">38</a>]. Similar studies on conflict in Pakistan have suggested that unemployment, poor
                  socioeconomic conditions, and a sense of deprivation pave the way for radicalising
                  the youth in the region [<a href="#R34">34</a>, <a href="#R39">39</a>, <a href="#R40">40</a>]. As the above research points out, for young people radicalisation becomes a coping
                  strategy. Rather than assuming radicalisation to be solely a result of religious extremism,
                  it can also come from poverty and socioeconomic marginalisation.

               <p id="d1e268">An important area of focus regarding youth and insecurities is the challenge of gender
                  relations and inequalities. Young women are victims of direct and indirect violence
                  in both conflict and peaceful contexts [<a href="#R41">41</a>, <a href="#R42">42</a>, <a href="#R43">43</a>]. Sexual and gender-based violence remains a significant problem for young girls
                  and women, especially in fragile and post-conflict countries [<a href="#R2">2</a>, <a href="#R44">44</a>]. This is a particularly relevant challenge in Afghanistan and Pakistan [<a href="#R45">45</a>, <a href="#R46">46</a>]. The Global Rights Report (2008) provides insight into the problem facing women
                  in Afghanistan, categorising the kinds of violence that affect them as physical violence,
                  sexual violence, forced marriages, and psychological violence. The overall average
                  for violence against women is 87.2%, and in Kabul it is 79.3%. The national average
                  for physical violence is 52.4%, while in Kabul it is 47.7%; for sexual violence, the
                  national average is 17.2%, while in Kabul it is 31.3%; for forced marriage, the national
                  average is 58.8%, while in Kabul it is 50.2%; and for psychological violence, the
                  average is 73.9% nationwide, and in Kabul it is 76.2% ([<a href="#R46">46</a>], pp.&nbsp;21-23). As the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) and
                  the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) have reported
                  (2009), findings reveal that Afghan women are subjected to an increasingly insecure
                  environment. Women participating in public life face threats, harassment, and attacks.
                  In extreme cases, women have been killed for holding jobs that are seen to disrespect
                  traditional practices or are considered ‘un-Islamic’. As a result, women engage in
                  self-censorship, restrict their movements, or discontinue their work. Threats and
                  different forms of intimidation and attacks are harmful psychologically as well as
                  physically ([<a href="#R46">46</a>], pp.&nbsp;1-2). Women in post-conflict areas are vulnerable to sexual and gender-based
                  violence. Gender based violence is a major cause, and consequence of, an overall gender
                  inequality in society.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e298">Another serious form of gender discrimination in Afghanistan is child marriage. According
                  to the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) and the Afghan Independent
                  Human Rights Commission, 57% of Afghan marriages are child marriages in which one
                  partner is under the age of 16. In a study of 200 married underage girls, 40% were
                  married between the ages of 10 and 13 years, 32.5% were married at 14, and 27.5% at
                  15 [<a href="#R47">47</a>]. Child marriage is not considered an offence under criminal law, meaning that there
                  are no criminal penalties for practising it, but it is prohibited under the Civil
                  Code ([<a href="#R48">48</a>], p.&nbsp;41). It has severe consequences on education and health; for example, girls
                  who marry at such a young age and then give birth to children are not prepared for
                  being a mother and the responsibilities it involves. In particular, an Afghanistan
                  Independent Human Rights Commission report notes runaways, suicides, self-immolations,
                  murders, sexual perversion, and psychological disorders as the consequences of child
                  marriage [<a href="#R49">49</a>]. Furthermore, child marriage has serious implications for literacy and leads to
                  low levels of school enrolment for young girls. Additionally, the lack of employment
                  and poverty force poor families to sell their girls into marriage to older men [<a href="#R50">50</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e312">A prevailing cultural practice called baad is another type of serious violence that
                  Afghan girls and women face. This informal method of conflict resolution allows aggrieved
                  families to end conflicts and restore peace by presenting or exchanging young girls
                  or women with the aggrieved party as compensation for the crime or conflict experienced
                  by the family. Not only is the practice of <i>baad</i> utilised to settle crimes such as murder, adultery, or rape, but it also acts as
                  a symbol of restoring the wronged family’s honour [<a href="#R50">50</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e320">‘Honour’ killings represent an extreme form of gender discrimination. Women bear most
                  of the brunt in honour killings, which occur when a woman runs away from a forced
                  marriage, elopes with a man without family consent, or engages with men that her family
                  considers to be inappropriate. Such actions are evaluated under traditional cultural
                  norms as actions that are prohibited for women [<a href="#R51">51</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e325">However, young girls and women are not the only ones to face sexual violence or rape;
                  young boys endure similar violence. The practice of <i>bacha bazi</i> (boy play) has been common in many parts of rural Afghanistan. It involves young
                  boys wearing makeup, dressing as young girls, and dancing in front of older men. The
                  boys are forced to have sexual intercourse with these older men, and if they refuse,
                  then they are either raped or badly beaten. The boys’ ages range between 9 and 18
                  years; they are typically from poor families and are recruited by wealthy men (e.g.,
                  rich merchants, militiamen, warlords, police, and government officials) who promise
                  them financial help, education, and work [<a href="#R52">52</a>, <a href="#R53">53</a>]. Nisya et al. (2019) pointed out how the justice and security sectors are part of
                  this racket. Perpetrators are seldom prosecuted because they have high connections
                  and sufficient money to bribe justice and security officials, who are sometimes perpetrators
                  of the crime themselves [<a href="#R38">38</a>, <a href="#R54">54</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e342">Pakistan has been ranked the third most dangerous country in the world for women,
                  according to a 2011 poll of experts by the Thomson Reuters Foundation Poll. More than
                  10,000 cases of gender-based violence were reported in Pakistan in 2014. Additionally,
                  official figures released by the Ministry of Human Rights of Pakistan reported 8,648
                  human rights violations in the country between January 2012 and September 2015, including
                  860 honour killings, 344 rapes or gang rapes, 268 sexual assault or harassment cases,
                  90 incidences of acid burning, 72 incidences of burning, 535 cases of violence against
                  women, and 481 cases of domestic violence [<a href="#R55">55</a>]. Pakistani human rights organisations estimate that approximately 1,000 honour killings
                  occur every year in the country [<a href="#R56">56</a>], although Article 25 (2) of the Constitution of Pakistan clearly states that no
                  person should be discriminated against because of sex alone [<a href="#R57">57</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e353">Tadjbaksh (2005) summarised the challenges that women in Afghanistan and Pakistan
                  face as follows:
               </p>
               <p id="d1e355">
                  <i>Human security has different connotations for men and women. For women, gender-based
                     violence is often engrained in local cultural and religious norms and is often tolerated,
                     while the international community condemns physical violence in armed conflicts. Furthermore,
                     since most of the physical and mental violence against women happens within the family,
                     the state may often shy away from intervening with the private sphere</i> [<a href="#R58">58</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e363">Many researchers have noted the importance of a gendered perspective when analysing
                  the roles, experiences, and socialisation aspects of men and women in conflict settings
                  [<a href="#R59">59</a>]. For example, a study by Stewart (2016) conducted in rural Kenya demonstrated that
                  livelihood affects gender relations. Changing livelihoods for both men and women impacts
                  how young men view their traditional male roles in society. For example, traditional
                  male livelihoods that are based on export crops, livestock or pastoralism, and labour
                  migration are declining, while female roles are also undergoing a change as new livelihood
                  opportunities are available to females in food crop production, petty trade, informal
                  services, beer brewing, and other industries [<a href="#R60">60</a>]. This has created a sense of disempowerment among young men in rural areas that
                  threatens their social value, identity, and self-esteem, the implications of which
                  result in growing violence and insecurity among young men, potentially leading to
                  domestic violence, increasing criminality, and intergenerational disagreements: ‘when
                  the traditional routes to becoming a man are blocked, young men may see violence as
                  the most readily available way of proving their manhood’ [<a href="#R59">59</a>, <a href="#R60">60</a>]. Similarly, in their seminal paper, Moser and van Bronkhorst (1999) illustrated
                  that the dynamics of violence and crime in Latin America and Caribbean regions are
                  influenced by a lack of economic opportunities, poverty, underdeveloped social welfare
                  systems, and weak educational systems. Such dynamics affect society in general and
                  the young population of men and women in particular. Moser and van Bronkhorst posited
                  that these dynamics affect men and women differently [<a href="#R61">61</a>].

               <p id="d1e401">The above diagram, although dated, graphically explains the insecurities that young
                  people face. The interconnectedness of poverty, unemployment, and poor educational
                  systems forces young men to resort to violence and criminality, which in turn involve
                  the police. Moser and van Bronkhorst (1999) point out how poor policing practices,
                  corruption, and brutality also tend to aggravate violence between youth and police,
                  thereby creating a deep chasm of mistrust. The diagram illustrates common insecurities
                  that both groups face and additionally points to the gendered nature of these insecurities
                  that affect young women and men differently. For young women, the same conditions
                  lead to premature pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases due to prostitution, dependency
                  on men, and the reproduction of poverty and violence. It further indicates that young
                  women are double victims of these violent acts and crimes. Similarly, in terms of
                  gender, our study builds on the interconnectedness of a broad set of insecurities
                  that young men and women experience and how these insecurities are gendered in ways
                  that often lead to violence and radicalisation.

               <p id="d1e406">Past research demonstrates that youth–police relations are complex and challenging
                  and that these challenges vary across contexts. Perceptions and attitudes towards
                  the police indicate that four variables—age, contact with police, neighbourhood, and
                  race—have an impact on the attitudes towards the police [<a href="#R62">62</a>]. Police–youth relations are also affected by how officers use their discretionary
                  powers when it comes to watching, stopping, searching, and arresting young people
                  suspected of doing something wrong. Brunson and Pegram pointed out how aggressive
                  policing strategies disproportionally affect youth of colour [<a href="#R63">63</a>]. Research has shown that negative experiences with the police have a more important
                  bearing on the legitimacy and trust than positive ones. However, perceptions of trust
                  can also increase if police can use such complaints about the police as a possibility
                  for change by treating youth in an inclusive rather than an exclusionary manner [<a href="#R64">64</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e417">Universally, a key challenge is the perception and attitude of the police towards
                  youth and vice versa [<a href="#R65">65</a>, <a href="#R66">66</a>]. Generally, young people are viewed through a dichotomous lens: they are either
                  perpetrators or victims of crime. As Forman stated, ‘Public safety turns, to a great
                  extent, on what the young do and what is done to them. This is the group most likely
                  to engage in criminal conduct, to be victims of crime, and to be targeted by the police’
                  [<a href="#R67">67</a>]. Cooperation and engagement with youth in fighting, reducing, and controlling crime
                  have been significant challenges for many police services around the world [<a href="#R20">20</a>, <a href="#R68">68</a>]. Furthermore, cooperation and engagement with youth critically depend on the level
                  of trust and legitimacy that the police establish with the group. Foreman further
                  posited that, ‘by treating the young exclusively as threats to public order, the state
                  creates and reinforces attitudes of hostility and opposition. This has negative consequences
                  for public safety because oppositional attitudes can increase law-breaking and make
                  it less likely that citizens will provide information to law enforcement’ ([<a href="#R67">67</a>], p.&nbsp;2). Such police attitudes toward youth create tense and hostile relations that
                  lead to mutual negative attitudes; in other words, youth generally feel that they
                  are over-policed and under-protected.
                  
               </p>
               <p id="d1e438">In their seminal study, Dirikx et al. (2012) examined the attitudes of Belgian youth
                  towards policing [<a href="#R69">69</a>] by focusing on three main aspects of policing: performance, distributive justice,
                  and procedural justice. The performance-based perspective is based on how people view
                  the efficacy of the police to control crime and keep neighbourhoods safe. The distributive
                  justice perspective focuses on the fairness and quality of police services that people
                  receive. Fair and quality service provided by the police to a diverse population would
                  enhance their support amongst people. Lastly, the procedural justice perspective emphasises
                  how people’s attitudes towards the police depend upon their judgments about procedural
                  fairness, which depend on four elements: ‘the opportunities for participation that
                  police officers provide in making their decisions; their friendliness and politeness;
                  their neutrality; and finally, their trustworthiness’ ([<a href="#R65">65</a>] [<a href="#R69">69</a>], p.&nbsp;193). As shown above their study reveals a complex interplay of different variables
                  that affect police–youth relations, as well as the heart of the dilemma in youth–police
                  relations: trust.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e449">A predominant challenge in post-conflict contexts is to establish cooperation and
                  trust between communities and police services. Given the nature of post-conflict settings,
                  trust levels are typically low. Policing research from post-conflict contexts has
                  identified important factors that affect the nature of this relationship: lack of
                  democratic policing, widespread corruption, illiteracy, abuse of police powers, and
                  a military style of policing [<a href="#R70">70</a>, <a href="#R71">71</a>, <a href="#R72">72</a>].

               <p id="d1e460">A pilot study conducted by the Afghanistan Civil Society Forum in 2010 for the United
                  Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and Ministry of the Interior (MoI) on democratic
                  policing highlighted some interesting perspectives on police–community relations,
                  covering eight northern districts of Kabul. Fifty-five percent of the respondents
                  were in the 18–35 age group. The study identified the public’s experiences with and
                  expectations for their local police, the public’s and the police’s understanding of
                  basic concepts of democratic policing, and the public’s and the police’s recommendations
                  for improving police effectiveness and the interface between them on a regular basis.
                  Sixty percent believed that better cooperation between the police and the public would
                  help improve security in the community, and 10% believed community policing to be
                  positive. However, study participants from focus group discussions (FGDs) argued that
                  there would be extremely limited cooperation between them and the police without the
                  establishment of mutual trust, and a significant obstacle to cooperation and trust
                  between them was corruption. According to the respondents, bribes to pay the police
                  for them to process cases, abuse of power, abuse of police facilities, and corruption
                  connected to higher levels of police, the justice system, and the government were
                  seen as the major obstacles to establishing good mutual relations. In other words,
                  lack of police accountability is a serious and important alienating factor ([<a href="#R73">73</a>], pp.&nbsp;5-7). This would influence in building good police-citizen relationships.

               <p id="d1e465">Another research report by Conciliation Resources (2018) described a series of FGDs
                  in three provinces (Kabul, Nangarhar, and Kandahar) with young Afghan activists, members
                  of civil society, and labourers. The youth were asked to share their views on a range
                  of topics, such as peace, security, livelihood challenges, and their views of the
                  future. The youth voiced a common complaint: the total disregard for the rule of law
                  by local leaders, politicians, and security providers in the country. According to
                  them, the police, Ministry of Justice, and Ministry of Education were the worst offenders
                  against the rule of law, and their actions comprised stealing government resources,
                  paying bribes to obtain admission to educational institutions or government jobs,
                  and other crimes. As one respondent remarked, ‘I see an increasing gap between the
                  government and the people, particularly young people who do not trust the government
                  and authorities’ ([<a href="#R74">74</a>], p.&nbsp;6). The consequences of such gap can seriously hurt community involvement in
                  local and national security needs.

               <p id="d1e470">A study conducted in Pakistan by the United States Institute of Peace (USIP) in 2011
                  found that police are incapable of combating rising insecurities and violence because
                  they are underequipped and understaffed and because there are various obstacles in
                  upgrading the existing police structure and system. The study further recommended
                  innovative and traditional mechanisms without which police would be unable to effectively
                  improve. The study revealed that there is a consensus among Pakistanis that the police
                  is unable to effectively fight crime, provide basic security to its common citizens,
                  maintain law and order, and combat growing militancy [<a href="#R75">75</a>]. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) police in 2014 kicked off reform efforts regarding policing
                  because the province is one of the most vulnerable to terrorism, militancy, and violence
                  since it borders the conflict-torn tribal areas of Pakistan. There are numerous political,
                  institutional, and technical reforms introduced in the KP Police Act 2017 aiming at
                  depoliticising the police and bridging the gap between the general public (especially
                  the youth) and the police [<a href="#R16">16</a>, <a href="#R76">76</a>, <a href="#R77">77</a>]. The existing studies on youth–police relationships and possible reform efforts
                  lack rigorous research wherein the ground realities must be inquired about and explored.
                  One of the objectives of this study is to unearth the real picture of existing youth–police
                  relationships amid the conflict situation and the reform efforts in policing.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e484">One common theme of the above research reveals is that establishing trust and accountability
                  is crucial for creating and maintaining good police–youth relations. However, the
                  research from Afghanistan and Pakistan has shown that creating trust between police
                  and youth is not an easy task. There are barriers and impediments that must be tackled.
                  For instance, corruption is a very serious issue that affects relations between police
                  and the public. Violent behaviour on the part of the police also accentuates the relational
                  gap; in fact, the police can be one of the major causes of local insecurity. Moreover,
                  lack of interest or incapacity to deal with local law-and-order issues can also be
                  a contributing factor in creating trust. However, we discuss further on in the paper
                  how COP can be a suitable and relevant policing approach in building trust and cooperation
                  between police and citizens.

               <p id="d1e492">In research, considerable debates and differences of opinion have erupted regarding
                  the definition of youth. This tussle includes formal definitions that categorise youth
                  in specific age groups or ranges with lower and upper limits for inclusion. The functional
                  definitions consider the roles and responsibilities of youth, while social-psychological
                  definitions emphasise growth, development, and the passage from youth to adulthood
                  based on cultural, social, economic, and political factors [<a href="#R78">78</a>, <a href="#R79">79</a>]. These definitional cleavages are also present in youth definitions when it comes
                  to our case studies from Afghanistan and Pakistan. However, as Williamson (2002) and
                  Cursi (2017) noted, concerns about youth—whether challenges, hopes, or aspirations—should
                  focus on the empirical realities that youth face rather than on definitional standpoints
                  [<a href="#R78">78</a>, <a href="#R80">80</a>]. Our paper also concentrates on the empirical realities that Afghan and Pakistani
                  youth face regarding their daily challenges and their consequences.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e506">In Afghanistan, the definition of youth is complex. The government of Afghanistan
                  divides youth into two categories: pre-youth (<i>naw jawan</i>), comprising those 12–17 years of age, and youth (jawan), including those aged 18–35
                  years; the first category refers to schoolchildren and the latter to young professionals.
                  However, as Hall (2013) noted, the governmental definition of the term is based on
                  a sociological understanding of the concept, which is contradictory to how youth define
                  themselves. For youth, physical growth is a more important criterion than age. Nevertheless,
                  the Central Statistics Organisation has a different categorisation of youth, dividing
                  them into three categories: pre-youth (11–14 years), teenagers (15–19 years), and
                  university students and young professionals (20–25 years) [<a href="#R81">81</a>, <a href="#R82">82</a>]. Moreover, the Afghanistan Youth Policy defines youth as people between the ages
                  of 18 and 35 and adolescents as those between 12 and 18 years of age. The ages of
                  the youth respondents in our case countries ranged from 19 to 35 years from both study
                  areas [<a href="#R83">83</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e520">In Pakistan, the Ministry of Youth Affairs defines youth as a timeframe in which a
                  family’s dependent children transform into independent adults and become responsible
                  citizens of a community [<a href="#R84">84</a>]. This definition indicates that age is not a factor for people to fall into the
                  youth category; rather, the determinant is their ability to contribute to society
                  or their families. The prescribed age bracket of 15–29 years is consistent with the
                  Commonwealth’s definition of <i>youth</i> [<a href="#R85">85</a>]. With regard to the percentage of youth, Pakistan is the fifth largest country globally.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e531">Field research for the present study was conducted in Afghanistan’s Nimruz province
                  and Pakistan’s KP province and erstwhile tribal areas. Nimruz is located in the south-western
                  part of the country, bordering Iran and Pakistan as well as Helmand and Farah provinces
                  in Afghanistan. Pakistan’s KP province is located in the north-western part of the
                  country.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e533">Our primary source of data were qualitative data from open-ended and semi-structured
                  in-depth interviews (IDIs) and FGDs. The interviews were analysed through the coding
                  of transcripts and interview notes, which led to the identification of themes that
                  shed light on the nature of youth insecurity and youth–police relations. The themes
                  emerged out of our discussions with youth, community members, social workers, and
                  Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs); all of them voiced their major concerns around
                  the insecurities that they faced in day-to-day life. The major topics centred on unemployment,
                  corruption, drug abuse, and insurgent activities. The primary data were complemented
                  by secondary research literature from the region. The secondary research literature
                  aims to shed light not only on the themes emerging from the data, but on insecurities
                  that are otherwise well-documented but not possible to sufficiently cover in this
                  field study due to their sensitive nature and the lack of data from our research.
                  The most important of these is gender-based violence. While we do not have data on
                  this subject, we still focus on the nature of gendered insecurities. The focus of
                  this study is therefore on the interdependence of a broader set of insecurities that
                  are both gendered and linked with gender-based violence as documented elsewhere and
                  as mentioned in general in interviews with CSOs and the police.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e535">In Pakistan, the districts of Swat and Peshawar in KP province were selected for the
                  study, while few of the NGO/ International Non-Governmental Organisations (INGOs)
                  workers were interviewed in Islamabad. During the period of our fieldwork (2015–19),
                  the region experienced a historic constitutional amendment in 2018 wherein the tribal
                  areas of Pakistan were merged with KP province. Most of the respondents hoped that
                  this constitutional move would have positive impacts on socioeconomic conditions in
                  the region. The criteria for selecting these areas were that Swat is a conflict-affected
                  district, while Peshawar is KP province’s capital where all of the government institutions
                  and headquarters—including the police—are located. Twenty IDIs and four FGDs were
                  conducted in Swat, while 10 IDIs and four FGDs were conducted in Peshawar. Moreover,
                  five interviews were conducted with NGO/INGO’s workers in Islamabad; hence, 35 IDIs
                  and eight FGDs in total took place in two areas in KP, Pakistan. All interviews were
                  conducted face to face.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e537">The FGDs were composed such that a minimum of four and a maximum of eight persons
                  were included in the discussion from various groups of respondents. The average time
                  used for the FGDs was an hour and a half. The data were collected from both male and
                  female youths, school and college teachers, local elders, <i>jirga</i> [<a href="#R86">86</a>] members, police personnel (both upper and lower ranks), NGO/INGO’s workers, and
                  the general public (including shopkeepers, traders, and small vendors). The representation
                  of female respondents was low because of the prevailing cultural obligations that
                  restrict women from interacting with strangers, restrict their mobility, and prevent
                  them from participating in political affairs. The primary data extracted from the
                  FGDs were analysed manually, using matrices and thematic methods of qualitative data
                  analysis. Themes were identified from the sections and subsections of the question
                  guide used during the FGDs.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e545">Regarding Afghanistan, we selected the province of Nimruz for several reasons. Firstly,
                  it has been one of the provinces with the lowest levels of international intervention,
                  and hardly any aid organisations operate in the region. Secondly, the province has
                  one of the highest numbers of migrants and internally displaced people in the country,
                  making it an interesting case to examine what unemployment and migration mean to young
                  people. Thirdly, due to its location, it is the fulcrum of illegal migration, human
                  trafficking, and the smuggling of drugs and narcotics.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e547">The data for Nimruz province are based on our fieldwork beginning in 2015. We interviewed
                  young men, young women, members of CSOs, police personnel, and NGO representatives—both
                  local and international. Additional data were collected from different local and international
                  NGOs and CSOs working in Kabul. Both local and international police personnel involved
                  with community policing were also interviewed. In addition, we talked with <i>shura</i> elders and members from selected <i>shuras</i> in Zanranj and Kang. We also conducted one FGD with five female elementary school
                  teachers in the district of Kang through a female assistant known to the local researcher;
                  the discussions with them revolved around employment, career opportunities, and personal
                  safety. Furthermore, we conducted four separate IDIs with youth in the same district,
                  and the topics of discussion revolved around livelihood opportunities, security challenges,
                  corruption, migration, experiences with the police, and the young people’s aspirations
                  for the future. In addition, we conducted open-ended and semi-structured IDIs with
                  10 residents of a rehabilitation centre for addicted youth. Our attention focused
                  on the root causes of their addiction and their stay in the rehabilitation centre.
                  To fill the gaps in our past interviews and acquire fresh perspectives on the situation
                  in Nimruz province, we conducted more than 10 telephone interviews with participants
                  in the provincial capital of Zaranj in October 2019. Despite the disruptions, it was
                  possible to speak with respondents from different occupations. We chose telephone
                  interviews because the situation in Zaranj was quite volatile, and our field assistants
                  faced death threats from Taliban and ISIS sympathisers. The major concern that people
                  mentioned was the return of the Taliban [<a href="#R87">87</a>] to power. All respondents wanted to migrate [<a href="#R88">88</a>] to a safe place, and Europe was their desired destination. Many of them did not
                  see any future in Afghanistan [<a href="#R89">89</a>].

            <p id="d1e567">The major concerns of the youth, social workers, and community members that we interviewed
               in Nimruz point to four main areas of challenges that young people face: unemployment,
               poverty, drug abuse, and corruption. Although the field studies in Pakistan and Afghanistan
               differed in some respects, they also had common elements. For example, KP has been
               a hotbed of Islamic insurgency, whereas Nimruz province, unlike many parts of Afghanistan
               that suffer from rising insurgency and violence, has been relatively calm, although
               some areas have seen a slight increase in insurgent activities. Both regions have
               witnessed rising youth movements that have raised questions regarding police performance;
               however, the predominant threats to the citizens—and, particularly, the youth—in both
               regions are the deteriorating economic situation, unemployment, corruption, drug abuse,
               and increasing insurgent activities. This became apparent in our data, and the results
               of drivers of insecurity thus centre on the themes of unemployment, drug abuse, and
               corruption.

                  <p id="d1e575">In Nimruz province, unemployment and poverty are paramount reasons for insecurity
                     and exclusion among youth. The most common grievance that most respondents discussed
                     is the lack of employment opportunities for local young people, which affects their
                     daily livelihoods. Since agriculture is a predominant source of employment in this
                     region, the lack of adequate water resources despite the abundance of cultivable land
                     significantly affects employment opportunities. As one respondent told us, he and
                     many others send their sons to Iran for work due to the lack of water and irrigation.
                     Many children are removed from schools so that they can seek work in Iran. According
                     to a civil society activist in Zaranj, the primary reason for Nimruz’s youth unemployment
                     is the ongoing drought that has affected the province over the past few years. As
                     he stated,‘Eighty percent of land in Nimruz is cultivable land, but lack of water
                     due to drought has drastically affected livelihoods here. This means that a large
                     number of people will be unemployed and have nothing to eat. A hungry person will
                     do anything—like theft—to feed his family, and this can lead to insecurity.’ According
                     to him, 70% of youth in Nimruz are unemployed, and out of the remaining 30%, only
                     10% have a real job with security. As another respondent mentioned, ‘Unemployment
                     is the biggest problem here. Then come corruption and drugs. All these badly affect
                     young people.’ The impact of unemployment on young people can be disastrous, as it
                     not only leads to corruption and drug abuse, but is also a primary cause of criminal
                     activities, violence, and extremism. According to a <i>shura</i> elder from Nimruz, the primary reasons that youth join insurgent groups are unemployment
                     and poverty: ‘When seven out of 10 youngsters in this locality are unemployed, there
                     will be a rise in crime due to poverty [<a href="#R90">90</a>] majority of the youth have no other option. (It’s) crime or find illegal routes
                     to Iran for job(s).’ The local population are aware of the indirect effects of unemployment
                     on youth, as they witness them first-hand. Unemployed young people have few options
                     in Zaranj: they can join the Taliban, anti-government groups, or criminal gangs; migrate
                     to Iran to work as labourers; or join thousands of heroin users and roam the dumps
                     of the city. These options may not be attractive, but they are the only choices available
                     to these young people. As one respondent remarked, ‘Unemployment itself is not a threat.
                     However, it can be a security threat. If a young person is unemployed and he has to
                     provide for his family, he may resort to theft, joining armed groups, and drug smuggling.
                     Unemployment and insecurity are part of a cycle and affect each other.’
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e583">Another respondent added, ‘Moreover, when they start stealing and robbing people,
                     this leads to police involvement and criminal cases against the youth’ The respondent
                     further reiterated that unemployment is worse among women who cannot work in the private
                     sector due to traditional societal norms and who are limited to specific jobs, such
                     as teaching. He added that women are less likely to work in male-dominated environments.
                     In a strictly patriarchal society in which men are the de facto heads of the household,
                     it is difficult to accept that, in many cases, women are the sole breadwinners. A
                     25-year-old Nimruz woman with the Afghanistan Youth Parliament told us that in Nimruz,
                     women are often the only breadwinners for their families and that unemployment can
                     thus gravely affect them. A male member of another civil society group in Zaranj further
                     mentioned that unemployment and social obstacles to access employment opportunities
                     could affect women’s social status and even expose them to violence. However, according
                     to another informant, ‘Most of the women cannot work or do not have jobs, and (being)
                     economically dependent on their husband(s) makes them more vulnerable to domestic
                     violence.’
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e585">In addition to having to contend with serious gender-based violent crimes, young girls
                     and women also face day-to-day harassment either on the street or at workplaces. As
                     a female informant from Nimruz mentioned, ‘Although there are some young women working
                     for NGOs, but the number is small compared to the number of educated women available
                     for jobs. This, I think, is because many girls and women face daily challenges of
                     working with men.’
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e587">Another informant, a male civil society informant in Zaranj, stressed unemployment
                     problems for women: ‘Even though unemployment is a serious problem among men and women,
                     the problem is much worse for women. While men can work in the private sectors, this
                     may not be possible for women. The only common job that women are involved with is
                     being a teacher. While we have many literate women, they are unemployed because no
                     facilitation has taken place for women to be able to work in other government sectors
                     and offices.’
                     
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e589">While unemployment affects the whole population in different ways, youth are the social
                     group that is most affected. A youth CSO member voiced his concern: ‘Even though all
                     age groups can face the same level of problems about security, we can say that youth
                     may resort to illegal activities much faster than older people because they do not
                     have life experience and have a lot of expectations.’
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e591">In our discussions with youth from the Kang district in Nimruz province, they reiterated
                     similar experiences and sentiments, speaking about their frustrations, fears, hopes,
                     and dreams for the future. The predominant challenge for all of them is unemployment;
                     although some have part-time jobs, the salaries are insufficient to earn a living.
                     As one youth expressed, the salaries do not allow them ‘to be able to study and become
                     somebody’. They further reported that the lack of economic opportunities forces them
                     to join extremist organisations, such as the Taliban, which offer economic incentives.
                     Other problems they face are drug dealing, addiction, and abuse. Since Nimruz province
                     borders Iran, drug dealing and cross-border smuggling are common and significant problems,
                     and the primary reasons for drug dealing are poverty, peer pressure, and the desire
                     to make money to pay intermediaries to emigrate.
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e593">Another major challenge that the youth face is the lack of proper recreational opportunities
                     and facilities. The male respondents who spoke with us expressed their dreams of having
                     a quality football field. For most, their ultimate aspirations are to earn an education
                     and obtain employment, and their dream jobs are teaching, engineering, working as
                     doctors, or joining the army. Many expressed the desire to marry and live happy, safe
                     lives. For girls, dreams are different. They are permitted to study only through the
                     elementary school level; to attend secondary schools, they must travel a significant
                     distance, which their parents do not allow due to local cultural norms and the uncertain
                     security situation. Even if they can obtain the necessary education, the only place
                     they are allowed to work is the local girls’ school, which does not have the capacity
                     to incorporate additional employees.
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e595">Most respondents mentioned unemployment, poverty, corruption, and drug abuse as the
                     largest impediments to youth progress and the greatest contributors to insecurity.
                     These were also mentioned as the root causes of young people taking to crime and joining
                     extremist groups like Taliban or ISIS, as well as a major reason to be involved with
                     the police. Police respondents in Nimruz also reiterated that unemployment, coupled
                     with the use and sale of drugs, is the major source of crime, violence, and insecurity
                     in the region. As one police officer told us,
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e597">
                     <i>Eighty percent of crimes in Nimruz are related to unemployment and (are) mostly committed
                        by young people who desperately want to make quick money. These young people will
                        do anything to make ends meet. Of course, the majority want to make money to migrate.</i>
                     
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e602">The above quote demonstrates that both citizens and police have similar concerns when
                     it comes to the key drivers of insecurity, namely unemployment and poverty that leads
                     to criminality.

                  <p id="d1e607">In Swat, as in the rest of Pakistan, unemployment is the primary source of insecurity.
                     Respondents from international and local NGOs in Swat, Peshawar, and Islamabad offered
                     diverse responses and concerns regarding the sources of insecurity. The majority stated
                     that unemployment is one of the leading sources of insecurity and is fuelling the
                     worsening law-and-order situation that has made the country an insecure place for
                     everyone from common people to state authorities. They stated that unemployment and
                     poverty are the driving forces that cause people to adopt illegal and criminal means
                     to survive.
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e609">The data collected in Swat illustrate multiple sources of insecurity in communities.
                     The respondents frequently mentioned youth unemployment as the most dangerous source
                     of insecurity because unemployment drives people to become involved in illegal activities,
                     including murder, theft, kidnapping, carjacking, and petty crime. Swat locals also
                     believe that those who join the Taliban are generally young people who are unemployed,
                     excluded, neglected, and deprived in society and who are critical of the government
                     and local landlords. Young men joining the Taliban and Al-Qaeda are common in both
                     Afghanistan and Pakistan; the data collected from both offer similar findings regarding
                     unemployment and the rise of Talibanisation and militancy. A civil society activist
                     from Swat said, ‘Unemployment is the main source of insecurity in Pakistan. When people
                     have no other option to feed their families, they involve themselves in theft, murder,
                     and other street crimes.’ Another respondent who works with an international organisation
                     based in Peshawar shared that ‘unemployment, poverty, and injustice are the main sources
                     of insecurity in Pakistani society at local and regional levels. At a national level,
                     unequal distribution of resources among provinces is the main source of insecurity
                     for the people.’
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e611">However, a youth activist from Swat hoped for a better future for youth in the district
                     after enduring a negative situation. He expressed that
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e613">
                     <i>Unemployment, an apolitical attitude, and high illiteracy rates are the major sources
                        of insecurity our youth are facing today. These sources of insecurities are related
                        to those young men who do nothing and spend most of their time in leisure. Most of
                        the youth from poor segments of society study in government schools and colleges,
                        and the quality of education is gradually improving in Swat, and I assume the insecurities
                        on the part of the youth are minimising day by day. The trend of madrassa is also
                        gradually vanishing, particularly in the post-conflict scenario. People avoid sending
                        their children to madrassa.</i>
                     
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e618">The impact of unemployment on young people can be disastrous, as it not only leads
                     to corruption and drug abuse, but is also a primary cause of criminal activities,
                     radicalisation, and violence. Pakistan must take advantage of its youth bulge in a
                     positive way; however, to date, the state has ignored the growing radicalisation among
                     youth, although the government has been striving to empower youth through multiple
                     initiatives. For example, the previous government of the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz),
                     or PML (N), began six initiatives to facilitate youth development to combat the soaring
                     unemployment at a cost of Rs 20 billion [<a href="#R91">91</a>]. These initiatives include merit-based scholarships, laptop distribution, fee reimbursement,
                     skill development programmes, free education for those in less-developed areas, and
                     interest-free loans to young people [<a href="#R92">92</a>]. Such initiatives can begin to ameliorate young Pakistanis’ frustrations, grievances,
                     and anxieties, which vary across regions and are complex in nature. For example, youth
                     from the newly merged tribal districts of the erstwhile Federally Administered Tribal
                     Areas, KP, and Baluchistan provinces have grievances with the state that are predominantly
                     related to unemployment, unequal distribution of scarce resources, and lack of proper
                     educational facilities. Additionally, their complaints and anger are directed towards
                     the authorities, who are responsible for the forced disappearance of thousands of
                     youths from tribal areas, the lack of inquiries into extrajudicial killings, the harsh
                     treatment at check-posts across tribal areas, and the lack of compensation for human
                     and property losses during military operations. They demand that the authorities establish
                     a truth and reconciliation commission examining military operations in tribal areas
                     [<a href="#R93">93</a>].
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e629">The Pashtun Tahaffuz (Protection) Movement (PTM), which primarily comprises young
                     people, rose to prominence in early 2018 in response to the above-mentioned grievances.
                     Through it, youth seek peaceful methods to voice their complaints and to turn the
                     state’s attention to these issues [<a href="#R33">33</a>, <a href="#R94">94</a>]. However, the state’s negligence in confronting their grievances has widened the
                     gap between law enforcement agencies—especially the police—and the Pashtun youth in
                     the region [<a href="#R95">95</a>]. For example, the youth are cautious in their approach and dealing with police authorities
                     when it comes to matters of personal and livelihood security. This study has found
                     that the young people themselves are discussing and addressing the challenges surrounding
                     livelihood, which is a substantial concern, and the insecurities that they face. Some
                     of these challenges create security issues of different types.
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e640">A recurring theme from our research sites was the impact of unemployment on youth
                     and its consequences on livelihood security and personal security. One can say that
                     unemployment is a universal concern for youth, though in conflict or post-conflict
                     contexts, the consequences can be much more severe. The examples from Nimruz and Swat
                     demonstrate that the vulnerabilities that young people face in pursuing their livelihoods
                     is affected by the availability of adequate economic opportunities, access to education
                     and local institutions, and political processes that influence decision-making. Livelihood
                     security is not only affected by the above factors, but can also be threatened by
                     poverty, corruption, and conflicts. The risk factors that accompany these insecurities
                     are migration and drug abuse. In order to ensure a secure livelihood, youth in Nimruz
                     migrate to Iran, while youth in Swat migrate to the big cities in Pakistan. However,
                     neither of these options may offer the needed security, and can they involve other
                     risks, such as theft, robbery, drug peddling, and abuse, as the following sections
                     will show.

                  <p id="d1e648">It is important to understand that the drivers of insecurity and challenges for youth
                     are interconnected and create a vicious circle that young people have difficulty escaping.
                     The nexus of migration and human trafficking is one such circle. This is the case
                     not only in Nimruz, but also in other parts of the country; however, Nimruz, as a
                     hub of migration and population movement in the country, has specific features that
                     may lead to additional social challenges, including drug addiction. Due to its location,
                     Nimruz is a principal port for human trafficking and drug smuggling to neighbouring
                     countries. As one respondent commented,
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e650">
                     <i>Addiction is a significant problem for youth. Due to insecurity, drug cultivation
                        is one of the most important means to make a living, and this cannot be stopped. Therefore,
                        this has also become a problem in Nimruz.</i>
                     
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e655">According to estimations from the head of the Youth Sub-directorate in Nimruz, at
                     least 2,000 people—mostly youth—illegally migrate to Iran. This has led to the widespread
                     availability of drugs, which has made the capital city of this province highly attractive
                     for addicts. Illegal migration and human trafficking as outcomes of unemployment and
                     insecurity have become an attractive option for youth, and such strategies to mitigate
                     the lack of livelihoods have consequences. A resident of a border district in Nimruz
                     expressed feelings of despair and anger:
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e657">
                     <i>Border inhabitants are a vulnerable population. Many young people have been killed
                        near the border. They were going toward Iran to earn some money, but even before reaching
                        the Iranian border, they were shot, and no one has asked why.</i>
                     
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e662">A rough estimate suggests that at least 3,000 women in Nimruz are addicts, which has
                     both direct and indirect consequences for young women. Female addicts also suffer
                     due to the physical violence that their spouses direct toward them. As one female
                     interviewee mentioned,
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e664">
                     <i>Being a female addict is not easy, as getting help or rehabilitation facilities is
                        either not easy or not possible. There are some rehabilitation centres for men, but
                        for women there are no facilities. In addition, most families will try to prevent
                        young girls or women from seeking outside help to save the ‘honour’ of the family.</i>
                     
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e669">Authorities further told us that many female addicts gathered from the streets or
                     returning from Iran are kept in brothels in Zaranj and the surrounding areas. We were
                     told that strongmen and police personnel are involved in a complex network of addicted
                     women, returnees, sex workers, children and youth, and drugs. As was mentioned to
                     us,
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e671">
                     <i>There are things that I cannot openly say, but there are networks, strongmen, and
                        police who run a complicated network that includes youth and children. They use children
                        to sell drugs, and when they are addicted, they are used as a tool for begging. Drugs
                        are so easy to get. If you are a newcomer in the city and you do not know anyone,
                        you can easily find people through drugs.</i>

                  <p id="d1e676">Our interviews at a rehabilitation centre in Zaranj revealed that 80% of young people
                     became addicts while they were in Iran as illegal labourers or immigrants. Many of
                     them were second-generation immigrants or job-seeking temporary migrants. The stories
                     of the immigration–addiction nexus that we heard at the rehabilitation centre demonstrate
                     the interconnectedness of such insecurities. One such story told by Karim (an alias)
                     highlights the plight of young people:
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e678">
                     <i>Karim was the eldest of five children who came to Zaranj city to make a living so
                        that he could support his family, who were poor. His family was from a nearby province.
                        Karim’s family got in touch with an intermediary who promised work for Karim in Zaranj
                        city. The family paid the intermediary some money for this service. In Zaranj, Karim
                        was introduced to a drug gang involved in smuggling drugs across the border into Iran.
                        Karim’s job was to smuggle drugs into Iran and sell them to drug couriers and labourers
                        working there. For these services, he was paid—not very well but enough to send some
                        (money) home to help his family. His family was not aware of the kind of work Karim
                        was doing; they were under the impression that he had a decent job. Karim also mentioned
                        how some border police and local police are involved in the drug racket scene. They
                        work closely with the drug gangs and are in the pockets of these gangs. According
                        to him, the police do not earn enough money, and this is the only way they can have
                        more money to feed their families. As for Karim, he started stealing some money and
                        small amounts of drugs and started taking drugs. He did this because the gang did
                        not pay him well and he felt cheated for the work he was doing for them. The gang
                        found out, beat him up, and threw him out on the streets. He lived on the streets
                        mostly by stealing until a local NGO worker, who brought him to the rehabilitation
                        centre, found him.</i>
                     
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e684">Youth, typically men, are the breadwinners of the family from an early age, and many
                     expectations are on their shoulders from the beginning. To feed their family or start
                     a family, youth must earn money, and an attractive option is labour in Iran. It pays
                     little, but after a year of tenacious work, one can earn enough to survive with their
                     family in Afghanistan for a year before returning to Iran. Many of these youth undergo
                     challenging hardships to reach Iran. For instance, many are caught in police crossfire
                     or killed by criminals, and those who reach Iran work for as long as six months to
                     pay the debt to their traffickers. Living in Iran illegally as a labourer or immigrant
                     is stressful. Labourers live in communal rooms with many people in similar situations.
                     Living a life of uncertainty and facing the prospect of a bleak future make drug abuse
                     a popular recreational activity among immigrant youth: they become drug addicts and
                     are thus deported. Back in Afghanistan, they again face a bleak future with no job
                     opportunities; with criminality being an immediate option, they are caught by the
                     police and face imprisonment.
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e686">The above case history captures the interconnectedness of the insecurities that young
                     people face growing up in post-conflict contexts: unemployment, poverty, child labour,
                     lack of educational opportunities, economic migration, and availability of drugs [<a href="#R96">96</a>, <a href="#R97">97</a>]. Hall’s study (2016) has demonstrated the causes and impact of drug abuse by young
                     people, finding that lack of jobs, illiteracy, and poverty are common variables that
                     lead youth to drugs. This aligns with another study conducted by the United Nations
                     Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) Afghanistan Drug Use Survey (2009), which mentions
                     that approximately 1 million drug users in the country are between the ages of 15
                     and 64. The survey further reveals that opium and heroin are two of the most common
                     drugs abused by young people; moreover, Afghanistan and Iran have some of the highest
                     numbers of users (UNODC, ‘World Drug Report 2012’). Both our data and other research
                     show that how drug abuse become coping strategies for youth in mitigating their livelihood
                     challenges.

                  <p id="d1e697">As in Afghanistan, drug abuse in Pakistan among young people is rapidly increasing.
                     The respondents informed that there are two types of young people involved in this
                     social issue. Firstly, there are those who are involved in the drug business to earn
                     money to either support their families or pay human traffickers to help them migrate
                     to other countries. Secondly, there are those who get addicted to these drugs. The
                     use of ice or crystal meth (methamphetamine) among young Pakistanis is alarming and
                     worrisome for law enforcement agencies; the State Minister for the Interior of the
                     present government has claimed that in Islamabad (Pakistan’s capital), 75% of young
                     female and 45% of male students across various universities are addicted to ice [<a href="#R98">98</a>, <a href="#R99">99</a>]. Another related problem is theft by drug addicts, who commit crimes to finance
                     their drug usage.
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e705">The majority of the respondents from local communities in Swat and Peshawar were of
                     the viewpoint that drug addiction can be attributed to unemployment, rural–urban migration,
                     and broken families. Particularly, the issue of how drug addiction among youth is
                     on the rise can easily be observed in the Hayatabad and Karkhano (famous mega marketplace)
                     areas of Peshawar, wherein drug addicts can be seen roaming around everywhere, including
                     the residential streets, marketplaces, and deserted areas. The local communities consistently
                     lodge complaints in the concerned police stations to eliminate these drug addicts
                     because they are the primary source of various crimes in the areas including theft,
                     abuse of children, and street crimes. The respondents shared that police have failed
                     to tackle the problem because the number of drug addicts is on the rise and the government
                     has no comprehensive policy to eliminate this serious social problem.
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e707">Upon asking about the causes and effects of drug abuse, respondents shared that unemployment,
                     negligence of the government, and the massive rural–urban migration due to military
                     operations in the tribal areas and subsequent internal displacements are the main
                     reasons for drug abuse among youth. The free roaming of these addicts has affected
                     the local inhabitants of Hayatabad, Peshawar in many ways—for instance, theft, rising
                     street crimes, child abuse, and stealing from residential areas during night time.
                     Respondents suggested that it would be difficult to tackle the issue of drug abuse,
                     including other youth issues, until and unless the police and other concerned departments
                     come up with solutions to rural–urban migration or displacement and create livelihood
                     opportunities for people living in rural areas that would eventually reduce the unemployment
                     burden. On the other hand, the police are of the viewpoint that they are frequently
                     monitoring the worsening situation but have failed to achieve the desired results
                     due to lack of resources to rehabilitate the addicts and eliminate the primary sources
                     behind this societal issue—that is, the massive rural–urban migration, the worse law-and-order
                     situation in the adjacent tribal areas, rising inflation, and unemployment among the
                     youth. Several incidents of murder, attempted murder, sexual abuse, theft, robberies,
                     and snatching have been reported in Peshawar and its suburbs where the accused were
                     found to be drug addicts.
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e709">Drug addiction is also on the rise in Swat; as per the government estimations, there
                     are over 4,000 drug addicts present, most of whom use heroin and ice drugs. The police
                     and civil government are trying to address the issue and have established Darul Kafala
                     (rehabilitation centre) for drug addicts [<a href="#R100">100</a>]. In both Peshawar and Swat, police—together with local communities, local public
                     liaison councils (PLCs), and other committees—are trying hard to eliminate the menace
                     of drug addiction from the society but failing to achieve desirable results. Both
                     the respondents from the police and local communities argued that the reasons and
                     sources of drug addiction (as mentioned earlier) are so strong and vibrant that despite
                     applying available remedies to stop it, drug addiction is on the rise.
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e714">If we compare both the cases of Afghanistan and Pakistan, one of the main reasons
                     for drug trade and abuse is linked to unemployment and poverty. As we have pointed
                     out drug trade and the participation of youth in this trade is to support their livelihoods,
                     and this makes them succumb to the use of drugs, which affects their insecurity. While
                     the centre provides some relief to addicts, but it does not address other psychosocial
                     insecurities that youth face. Most treatments at drug centres are medical in nature
                     and little or no social counselling is provided to facilitate patients’ rehabilitation
                     into society. Additionally, social stigma and family honour add to the mounting insecurity
                     affecting youth, and the consequences of not reintegrating youth into society force
                     them to become marginalised and susceptible to criminality or extremism.

               <p id="d1e722">In the Nimruz case, the interviewed youth reported widespread disillusionment; they
                  did not expect any positive developments in terms of decreasing corruption in the
                  near future. As mentioned earlier, our informants in both case countries frequently
                  reiterated this expectation. One considerable element of frustration, especially among
                  the educated youth, was obtaining employment in either the public or private sector.
                  Many voiced their frustration and anger at people who obtain jobs for which they are
                  not qualified—either through their connections with people in high offices or through
                  tribal affiliations. Moreover, even if people do get jobs, their position is not secure.
                  Some must resort to corruption to keep their jobs intact. As one respondent mentioned,
                  
               </p>
               <p id="d1e724">
                  <i>It can also be said about job security. When someone gets a job, he or she must be
                     careful because since there is corruption, his or her position can be sold to someone
                     else. Since job security is so weak and the employee does not feel safe, he or she
                     might resort to corruption to fill his or her pockets before candidates having better
                     connections get the job, even if they are not qualified.</i>
                  
               </p>
               <p id="d1e729">Most of our informants mentioned that corruption within government, police, and educational
                  institutions is so prevalent that their trust in these institutions is minimal. They
                  viewed their future in the country as hopeless, and many argued that the only possibility
                  of a better life is to migrate out of the country. As one informant mentioned,
               </p>
               <p id="d1e731">
                  <i>Unemployment is a big problem all over the country. Nimruz is a border city, and we
                     can see people leaving the country illegally on a daily basis. I can estimate that
                     at least around 2,000 people are leaving the country to Iran every day. Moreover,
                     80% to 90% of them are youth. It is not only unemployment that makes them leave the
                     country but also corruption, insecurity of life, and war are other reasons.</i>
                  
               </p>
               <p id="d1e736">In Nimruz province, the lack of trust in and corruption of formal official institutions
                  means that most youth prefer the informal institutions available to them for advice,
                  conflict resolution, and interaction with government institutions. A civil society
                  activist estimated that at least 75% of youth would prefer to consult <i>shura</i>, [<a href="#R101">101</a>] family elders, and youth networks for help and services. Furthermore, trust in the
                  police among youth is relative. As one youth informant explained,
               </p>
               <p id="d1e744">
                  <i>If there is a personal or family connection between the youth and the police, then
                     the level of trust is high and the police receive support. This further depends on
                     the mutual experiences that police and youth have with each other.</i>
                  
               </p>
               <p id="d1e749">CSOs have been introducing programmes to facilitate and support the police and army
                  personnel with youth issues. Although corruption is a challenge, the CSOs believe
                  that working directly with the police through meetings and consultation can improve
                  their services.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e751">Our findings echo another study, ‘Youth study on peace and security: Afghanistan (2018)’,
                  in which respondents expressed similar sentiments of frustration towards such nepotism.
                  In this study, youth were especially angry that corruption had become an integral
                  part of almost all interactions. One respondent stated, ‘Government positions are
                  sold in the market, and if you pay a specific amount of money, you can buy a position…even
                  if you are illiterate and uneducated’ ([<a href="#R3">3</a>], p.&nbsp;6). The Asia Foundation Report, Afghanistan 2018 further highlighted this problem
                  through its yearly survey, in which 81.5% of respondents considered corruption to
                  be a substantial problem. The respondents’ experiences and interactions with different
                  institutions highlighted the challenges of corruption: 67.5% of respondents experienced
                  corrupt practices while seeking admission to schools and universities, as well as
                  when receiving documents from the same; 65.1% encountered corrupt practices in their
                  interactions with the Afghan National Police; and approximately 65% mentioned that
                  they often experienced corruption when applying for work. These figures do not vary
                  by age or gender ([<a href="#R102">102</a>], pp.&nbsp;118-119).
               </p>
               <p id="d1e759">The unemployment, poverty, drug abuse, and corruption vulnerabilities of the youth
                  in Nimruz are common for children and young people in other parts of Afghanistan.
                  Our findings here echo those from two studies conducted by Samuel Hall in 2016 and
                  2017 that elucidated the vulnerabilities faced by Afghan youth. One primary focus
                  of the 2016 study was the impact of mental health issues faced by these youth. Reasons
                  for mental health disorders among internally displaced persons and forced returnees
                  include the lack of socioeconomic opportunities, marginalisation, isolation, trauma,
                  and stigma. In addition, the youth also mentioned how different forms of violence,
                  such as theft, gangs, and terrorist attacks, affect their livelihood. Hall’s 2017
                  study, which was conducted inside the Juvenile Rehabilitation Centre in Kabul, demonstrated
                  that youth who have broken the law in different ways experience problems and challenges
                  both during detention and after being released, and this factor can affect their future
                  lives. Hall’s three-part study reveals existing vulnerabilities, risks, and barriers
                  faced by youth. The first part provides reasons that they are imprisoned. Many children
                  mentioned theft due to poverty and unemployment as a major factor for their imprisonment;
                  ‘43% of the overall population are charged with theft/robbery, followed by moral crimes
                  [<a href="#R103">103</a>] (14%). Other charges include drug offences, physical fights, the sale of alcohol,
                  and trespassing. The most serious charges are of murder (13%) and sentences for threatening
                  Afghanistan’s national security (12%), including terrorism charges’ ([<a href="#R102">102</a>], p.&nbsp;23). The children explained that on many occasions, the police either detained

               <p id="d1e770">One young informant from Nimruz tellingly captured the significance of the problem:</p>
               <p id="d1e773">
                  <i>Unemployment is (the) source of all social corruption. As much as people are patient,
                     their patience will wear thin. Moreover, they would commit crimes. One cannot eat

                     unemployment is the source of all corruption. Unemployment can lead to drug addiction.
                     Unemployment is the main reason behind drug addiction all over the country. Here,

                  of the trust deficit between the public and various governmental institutions in Pakistan
                  and that the police frequently have prominent interactions with the public. As per

               <p id="d1e805">There are, however, other issues that influence the public’s trust in the police,
                  such as their inability to adequately address gender-based violence. A well-known
                  female social activist from Peshawar expressed her views on the insecurity looming
                  around women:
               </p>
               <p id="d1e807">
                  <i>Women are more insecure than anyone in the communities. In a society where women are
                     at times unable to even get to a police station, it is no surprise that so many cases
                     of domestic abuse and other forms of violence go unreported.</i>
                  
               </p>
               <p id="d1e812">A woman from an international organisation based in Peshawar explained further,</p>
               <p id="d1e814">
                  <i>Nine out of ten women experience violence, usually at the hands of family, but few
                     go to police. It is okay to hit a woman. It is okay to throw acid on a woman. It is
                     okay to kill a woman. These are the areas we live in and the times we live in.</i>
                  
               </p>
               <p id="d1e819">In Pakistan, addressing sociocultural and religious factors surrounding gender is
                  vital for effective gender-responsive policing interventions. Data collected in the
                  Peshawar and Swat regions of Pakistan with respondents from NGOs, INGOs, government
                  officials, and police personnel clearly indicate that gender-based violence is considered
                  one of many critical issues in Pakistan and that women are prone to experiencing various
                  kinds of violence at the hands of male community members and have limited access to
                  police protection and justice. Most women are not permitted to obtain education, work,
                  or even leave their homes on their own without a male relative. As one young woman
                  from Swat said,
               </p>
               <p id="d1e821">
                  <i>There are so many reasons why women wouldn’t report domestic abuse. They may not be
                     aware that police can help them, or they feel shame or fear that their husbands will
                     beat them more or that they will become outcasts from their family. This environment
                     drastically reduces women’s access to justice.</i>
                  
               </p>
               <p id="d1e826">Community involvement in policing services, as well as behavioural and attitudinal
                  change training, is necessary to increase gender responsiveness and accountability
                  in policing. Police in KP have introduced and implemented steps to ensure gender-responsive
                  policing in the province. For example, enhancing the role of trained women in policing
                  is an important component of managing the increasing trend in violence against women.
                  One example is the establishment of women’s desks at police stations. For example,
                  each police station must house a separate desk specifically to oversee female-related
                  issues. A study of a UK-funded program found that the establishment of women’s desks
                  at five police stations in Peshawar led to a 57% increase in the reporting of incidents
                  in one year, commenting that it helped reduce the stigma of reporting such crimes:
                  ‘For a woman to go to the police to make a complaint against a male in her household,
                  that is a huge, huge step. The presence of a woman police officer softened the blow
                  to the family. It made it acceptable for them to bring her back into the house’ [<a href="#R106">106</a>]. Unemployment and poverty also affect those women living in traditional societies,
                  in which they only perform household chores. A community elder from Swat valley told
                  us that, ‘unemployment and extreme poverty create dissonance among the family members,
                  and ultimately, the women in the household have to bear physical violence and torture
                  by the male members of the family’.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e831">Additionally, some police stations across the study areas in Pakistan have separate
                  women’s complaint cells, which have been effective in resolving cases of gender-based
                  violence, although significant work remains, and reforms are needed to allow women
                  and other vulnerable segments of society a respectable and equal place. This is part
                  of a broader effort by both governmental organisations and NGOs to promote the enactment
                  of new laws through legislation and research-based initiatives that improve police
                  services. For example, the newly implemented KP Police Act of 2017 aims to depoliticise
                  police and make them accountable to the elected institutions at both the district
                  and provincial levels. Moreover, the establishment of PLCs, dispute resolution councils
                  (DRCs), and citizen–police liaison councils (CPLCs) through the act can begin to close
                  the widened gap between the people and the government [<a href="#R16">16</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e836">As we have seen from the above description, complex issues are at work when it comes
                  to questions of livelihood challenges and human security at the local level. Those
                  best positioned to understand the interplay of the issues are the communities themselves
                  since they are the ones who experience these day-to-day challenges either directly
                  or indirectly. In both case countries, trust and corruption are main concerns for
                  youth and other segments of the society. It can be echoed from our findings from both
                  case studies that corrupt practices in government departments are inevitable for one’s
                  survival and job security. Despite several reforms’ efforts, police and the judiciary
                  are the most corrupt institutions in Pakistan as per the National Corruption Perception
                  Survey 2021 conducted by Transparency International Pakistan, and our data suggest
                  the same in the case of Afghanistan.

               <p id="d1e841">Earlier sections have shown that livelihood opportunities are often limited in post-conflict
                  areas. Especially for the younger population, this can lead to feelings of hopelessness
                  and make them extremely vulnerable. It is also important to understand that conflict
                  affects boys and girls differently. Enduring poverty and lack of economic prospects
                  also leave youth vulnerable to participating in criminal activities as a livelihood
                  strategy. They are more easily recruited into criminal groups and drug trafficking.
                  In addition to providing an income, membership in organised crime groups can provide
                  protection, safety, and an important sense of belonging and identity. As a result,
                  authorities may stigmatise, chase, or beat them—whether randomly or in a targeted
                  manner. Additionally, youth may cope with their situation by migrating or using drugs,
                  which may lead to further insecurities. Another coping strategy may be radicalisation.
                  Rather than assuming radicalisation to be solely a result of religious extremism,
                  it can also come from poverty and social and political marginalisation. As our case
                  examples show, the drivers of insecurity for the youth are interconnected, creating
                  a vicious circle of vulnerability and risk. As pointed out earlier, research has revealed
                  that police–youth relations in post-conflict contexts have their own challenges. The
                  challenges of police insecurity, militarised and aggressive policing practices, abuse
                  of police powers, corruption, and lack of trust and accountability tend to create
                  a volatile relationship between police and youth. It becomes clear that issues of
                  livelihood security and personal security are closely entwined, and there is a need
                  to take an integrated approach to understanding these livelihood processes so that
                  local communities might be in a better position to tackle their human security needs.
                  It is also vital to understand how institutions, such as the police and government,
                  can contribute to rather than threaten human security. For the police, there is the
                  need to consider these issues through a civilian rather than a militarised or ‘force’
                  approach of policing. This is where the advantages and strength of COP as a policing
                  and preventive approach can be useful in creating this bridge of collaboration and
                  engagement between law enforcement and local communities.

               <p id="d1e849">The previous sections have identified some key drivers of insecurities that youth
                  face and how these are interlinked with policing issues. As previously stated, police–community
                  relations in post-conflict contexts are problematic and challenging. The lack of trust
                  in the police is a significant impediment to fostering their relations with the public.
                  In this section, we examine how a shift towards COP might contribute towards bettering
                  youth–police relations and how these relations can open spaces for better communication
                  in addressing human security issues. In the first year of police reform in Afghanistan
                  following the Bonn peace agreements in 2001, the focus of policing was on the training
                  of police in military tactics and fighting insurgents, with very little focus on the
                  broader set of insecurities that local communities experience.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e851">After realising the need for more civilian-focused police, the government of Afghanistan
                  turned to COP, as voiced through the policy document Police-E-Mardumi (PeM)[<a href="#R107">107</a>], which defines the importance of ‘the cooperation between the people and the police’
                  and highlights that those problems must be solved through close <i>cooperation</i> and <i>coordination</i>. The terms cooperation and coordination are broad concepts and recurring themes in
                  many governmental documents that discuss community policing; initially a project,
                  PeM has now become a permanent directorate within the MoI. The secondary units of
                  PeM were extended in a few provinces in the country, and prior to the departure of
                  one of its primary supporters, the European Union Police Mission (EUPOL), from Afghanistan,
                  it had reached almost all provinces. According to the PeM protocol, the first step
                  is to establish a <i>shura</i>-e police or police–public consultation <i>shura</i> (PCCS), which is utilised as a bridge between the police and the people. In the first
                  meeting between the community and police, the concept of community policing is introduced.
                  A similar unit was also established in the province of Nimruz [<a href="#R108">108</a>]. As a young NGO activist reiterated,
               </p>
               <p id="d1e872">
                  <i>When we think of police in Afghanistan, we think of war, of a warlord, and of a rough
                     and tough person. This has caused a gap between people and the police. People think
                     of police as a rough person who is fighting on the frontline and has no idea about
                     working with the people and their problems. The PeM program tries to solve this problem.
                     PeM is facilitating bringing police and people closer and conveys the message that
                     the police are working for people’s safety and together they can work for better security.</i>
                  
               </p>
               <p id="d1e877">For instance, the PeM Community Policing Directorate has been given the green light
                  to establish and operationalise 19 diverse councils in each of the police districts
                  of Kabul, comprised of elders, religious persons, women, youth, influential community
                  members, students, representatives of the educational directorate at the local level
                  and the police commanders, and a liaison officer from the PeM directorate to address
                  community issues. Issues that are taken up are land grabbing, unemployment, addiction
                  problems, corruption, gender-based violence, school safety, criminal activities, and
                  violence and issues regarding the police. Thirty percent of the membership in these
                  <i>shuras</i> is reserved for women who come from civil society and schools and are known activists.
                  Beyond the capital, PeM has expanded to include offices in 34 provinces of Afghanistan,
                  with 337 PCCSs comprised of 13,480 members at provincial and district levels. The
                  meetings are generally conducted in police buildings and are usually held twice each
                  month. The people elect the members from their respective police districts.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e882">These <i>shuras</i> are important venues in which governmental organisations and police representatives
                  can directly meet and consult community representatives to address security concerns.
                  The youth and the larger community can express their grievances towards the government
                  and the police to take a stand on many security-related issues. However, respondents
                  mentioned to us that contact between the youth and police frequently occurs as personal
                  contact and is needs-based. A young person who works for a CSO mentioned the following:
               </p>
               <p id="d1e887">
                  <i>We do not have regular meetings or procedures, but we have personal relationships
                     and use them to connect with the police. For example, 25 days ago, we had a meeting
                     with them (the police). We have a monthly meeting among the members of the civil society,
                     and in one of the meetings, we discussed the problem of availability of drugs on the
                     street and car theft. We decided to talk to the police about this. We contacted them,
                     and then we set a meeting with the deputy chief of the police regarding these issues.
                     We asked them to adopt measures based on our recommendation. After that, we saw some
                     improvements, and some arrests were made.</i>
                  
               </p>
               <p id="d1e892">At the meeting, the police officer promised to address this issue. Following the meeting,
                  some arrests were made, but according to some respondents, police efforts are inconsistent,
                  and civil society must regularly push the police into action. When <i>shura</i> members return to their communities, the legitimacy that they gain from the involvement
                  with PCCSs allows them to become part of the local or traditional conflict resolution
                  mechanism in their neighbourhoods. These <i>shura</i> further act as a conflict resolution mechanism in which citizens can discuss the
                  conflicts that they are facing and provide a bridge between the community and the
                  police. Furthermore, the police gain public participation in security-related activities.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e900">These PCCSs are important arenas for youth–police interactions. However, our research
                  additionally reveals mixed feelings towards the police and, thus, different levels
                  of trust between the people and the police at the community level in Nimruz province.
                  While some respondents stated that they do not trust the police, others attributed
                  the considerable level of security in their districts to the unity and cooperation
                  between the police and the community; the difference depends on the modality of their
                  interaction. An informant expressed his thoughts regarding the police as follows:
               </p>
               <p id="d1e902">We can categorise the police into two groups. The first group is the low-ranking police,
                  and the second is high-ranking police (officers). A few days ago, I was on my way
                  to work, and I was stopped at a checkpoint. The police officer asked me if I was a
                  government official. I said, ‘What is the difference, and why do you want to know?’
                  He said, ‘I want to know’, and I said, ‘No, I am not working with the government.’
                  He politely asked me if he could search the car. I allowed it, and after he was finished,
                  I left. I told this to a friend of mine, who recalled an encounter he had witnessed:
                  a while back, a police officer had stopped an unruly motorcycle rider, but the rider
                  had not answered the officer’s questions. Instead, the rider had called the district’s
                  chief of police, who was his own father. The police chief, upon hearing the story,
                  both scolded and beat up the police officer because he had dared question his son.
                  Now, if high-ranking officers behave in this way, what can you expect from low-ranking
                  cops? This can discourage low-ranking police officers. Such behaviours affect trust.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e904">For people whose relatives are part of the police, the police are considered a friendly
                  institution, while for others, the police are a corrupt organisation. When we asked
                  our respondents if they have any regular communication with police, they said that
                  they have nothing to communicate to them; they—the police—only work with smugglers
                  and regulate the goods and oil smuggling across the border. Some respondents believed
                  that people only interact with the police when they commit crimes; for example, they
                  replied by saying, ‘Thank God we have nothing to do with the police. We don’t commit
                  any crimes.’ For them, interaction with the police means something negative, and the
                  police are viewed as interacting only with the corrupt. Although the respondents said,
                  that their relationship with the police is good, they primarily meant that they have
                  no real interaction because they have not done anything wrong.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e907">Levels of trust in the police are also low among women. According to a female civil
                  society activist, there have been reports of corruption in the Female Response Units
                  (FRUs) [<a href="#R109">109</a>] of Nimruz, causing women to prefer to speak with the Directorate of Women’s Affairs.
                  This lack of trust can lead to further unemployment among women because few are willing
                  to join the police due to fear of sexual harassment. Corruption and lack of trust
                  in the police may additionally result in more women referring to traditional structures
                  or CSOs. Based on our interviews, many women prefer to reach out to the Directorate
                  of Women’s Affairs, women’s shelters, religious figures, CSOs, Community Development
                  Councils (CDCs), and other entities. When we asked a civil society activist about
                  the level of trust between women and police, she said,
               </p>
               <p id="d1e912">
                  <i>I cannot say there is no trust at all, but there are some elements in the police who
                     destroy the existing level of trust. For example, a few months ago, a policeman was
                     pressing and threatening the women shelter’s administration that a woman living in
                     the shelter should marry him because she did not have any guardian. This does not
                     paint a good picture.</i>
                  
               </p>
               <p id="d1e917">The police have their own categories and opinions of youth. For example, in one of
                  our interviews with an officer from Nimruz province, the respondent mentioned how
                  the police both perceive and categorise them:
               </p>
               <p id="d1e919">
                  <i>I categorise them—youth—in three groups. The first group is the students who do not
                     do anything wrong. The second group are the educated and bright youth who want to
                     be part of government and support the government and the police, and the police have
                     a good relationship with them. The third category are mostly youth in the villages
                     and districts where the Taliban have influence. Some of them, although living under
                     Taliban influence, have good intentions regarding the government, but there is another
                     category that hates the government and supports the Taliban, Al-Qaeda, and ISIS. This
                     last category is involved in a variety of crimes. They are constantly looking for
                     opportunities to make quick money through all possible means, such as selling drugs
                     or firearms, stealing, or informing.</i>
                  
               </p>
               <p id="d1e924">While many of these challenges are widespread and the police may not be involved in
                  them directly, many of these issues bring the police into the picture; however, forums
                  such as the PCCSs have created spaces for interactions and connections. It is important
                  for youth to view the police as more than an institution that they visit after something
                  negative has happened. As one youth participant in a police–community meeting stated,
               </p>
               <p id="d1e926">
                  <i>These meetings are a great way to interact with the police. Such meetings create a
                     space for understanding our problems that we face and give us the opportunity to understand
                     the police’s challenges. Many youth have a very bad picture of the police.</i>
                  
               </p>
               <p id="d1e931">The government’s establishment of channels of communication and relationship building
                  through COP are crucial steps in addressing important livelihood and personal security
                  concerns of communities. However, these initiatives are not enough, as people still
                  view the police with scepticism and mistrust. In both Afghanistan and Pakistan, civil
                  society–driven initiatives have played a crucial part in promoting COP through joint
                  projects for community–police engagement as discussed below.

               and Youth
            </h2>
            <p id="d1e936">In 2013, the international community, the UN, and a number of national NGOs allied
               in one of the largest community policing projects: the Afghanistan Democratic Policing
               Project. The project included many activities, among which were safety and school
               outreach activities aimed at youth. The purpose was to generate awareness among schoolchildren
               and youth regarding increasing public safety. The government of the Netherlands funded
               it, while the UN Office for Project Services managed the project, and UNAMA managed
               its implementation. Sayara, an international NGO and one of the implementation partners,
               trained the police to conduct safety briefings in schools and other community venues,
               including mosques. Police officers from the local community-policing unit visited
               schools to both inform and provide practical demonstrations to students regarding
               how to react in emergencies such as fires, traffic accidents, floods, and earthquakes,
               and they also addressed mine awareness and how to provide first aid. They also distributed
               school bags, pencil cases, lunch boxes, flashlights, and medical bags to the schools.
               Additionally, the local police discussed their role in serving the wider community.
               The safety outreach component covered 15 districts in seven provinces, with PeM teams
               contacting three schools or community groups per district. In many instances, the
               police and CSOs cooperated to conduct outreach programmes, which were delivered to
               schools in different provinces. Such participatory and cooperative efforts contributed
               to building positive trust-based relations among the police, CSOs, and the youth.
               In addition to Bamyan, other Afghan provinces—including Balkh, Baghlan, Ghor, Helmand,
               Kunduz, and Uruzgan—became part of this outreach programme [<a href="#R50">50</a>, <a href="#R110">110</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e944">Another example of police efforts to improve relations with local communities took
               place in Herat. In close cooperation with EUPOL and with financing from Deutsche Gesellschaft
               für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), the local PeM unit conducted a series of
               awareness campaigns for traffic safety in schools and colleges across the city, which
               were experiencing a rise in injuries and deaths among students due to traffic accidents.
               Police distributed stop signs, traffic paddles, and reflective vests, focusing on
               crosswalk safety training for students. Such initiatives may be small but are nonetheless
               important to building trust and confidence and improving interactions between young
               people and the police (Field interviews with EUPOL Staff, 2015).
            </p>
            <p id="d1e946">In a similar fashion, CSOs, sports bodies, and clubs in Kabul and a few provinces
               in the country were interested in improving relations with the police. The project
               comprised police and youth from diverse backgrounds who trained together, forming
               joint teams in either football or cricket to play in tournaments with other local
               teams. These projects became popular, opening avenues for cooperation in fighting
               crime, drugs, and terrorism (Field interviews with UNAMA Staff, 2015).
            </p>
            <p id="d1e948">For example, in Kabul, a women’s NGO successfully cooperated with police stations
               to train personnel to help victims of domestic violence. The training involved basic
               services for victims, legal aid, and knowledge regarding gender rights. Additionally,
               the NGO assisted the police in providing safe shelters for victims, as their stations
               did not have capacity for that project (UNAMA informant, 2015).
            </p>
            <p id="d1e950">A private NGO founded in 1996, PARSA, works directly with several groups in Afghanistan.
               In our discussion with the head of PARSA and two members of the organisation, we were
               told that they participate in various projects with the most vulnerable people in
               society, such as destitute women and orphaned children, to provide economic programmes
               for women living in shelters. An important project that PARSA re-established in 2008
               is the Scout programme for youth. The Scout movement was established in 1931 and was
               active until 1970; however, due to various conflicts affecting the country, it lost
               momentum. Governmental support and financial assistance from international organisations
               enabled the movement to slowly gain popularity among the youth in 2008. Officials
               mentioned to us that PeM worked with the Scouts on two projects: community outreach
               and community service programmes. PeM representatives attend the Scoutmaster’s programme
               to develop outreach skills in youth and then teach and train Scouts on safety measures
               regarding fire, traffic, first aid, and mines. Scouts then teach other youth under
               the guidance of PeM, planning community service programmes that involve planting trees,
               cleaning schools, and removing trash. In cooperation with PeM, Scout programmes provide
               opportunities for those who are at risk of being recruited into extremism. Scouts
               contact the communities through PeM, calling on community elders—which include <i>maliks</i>, <i>shura</i> members, and District Development Authorities (DDA) members—to introduce their programmes.
               There are roughly 2,500 Scouts in the country, 30% of whom are girls. In our discussion
               with the head of PeM in 2018, we were told that the relationship between Scouts and
               PeM is based on ongoing projects: when the project ends, the relationship will become
               an ad-hoc one, which means that the police will contact the Scouts if there are programmes
               (per field interviews conducted in 2016).
            </p>
            <p id="d1e958">In Nimruz, the Scout programme is conducted with the help of and coordination between
               PeM and the Directorate of Education. There are 680 Scouts in Nimruz province, and
               PeM trains them on school safety programmes, police responsibilities, and their role
               in the community. These Scouts are then assigned to teach other students about the
               school outreach programmes and the police. According to a civil society activist who
               participated in some PeM shura meetings in Nimruz, ‘these meetings could provide a
               platform to remove the gap between the public and the police’. For example, police
               are depicted as a ‘warlike institution rather than being people oriented; therefore,
               these meetings may allow young people specially to view the police differently. Furthermore,
               these meetings have become a venue for young people to meet with each other and create
               a network.’
               
            </p>
            <p id="d1e960">The cooperation among youth, international agencies, CSOs, and police is important
               for creating conditions for COP to be effective in minimising citizens’ insecurity.
               These relationships can improve knowledge transfers among youth, police, international
               agencies, and CSOs. The participatory nature of such projects offers channels for
               communication and cooperation. Coyne and Nyborg (2020) highlighted the advantages
               of a civilian-centred approach towards police–community participation. Such a cooperative
               approach provides an incentive for the police to improve their behaviour and performance
               towards the community and creates a platform for police accountability. This type
               of grassroots approach is uncontroversial, and it creates an alternative vision of
               policing in which communities and police cooperate to overcome insecurity. The strength
               of a civilian-based approach is the wide variety of knowledge, skills, and connections
               that it offers, which is important for creating locally sustainable solutions to security
               challenges. The participatory and dialogic nature of such involvement opens avenues
               for implementing COP practices in a sustained manner [<a href="#R6">6</a>].

               <p id="d1e968">While several attempts were made to reform an inherently colonial police force since
                  Pakistan’s independence in 1947, they were not successful until the Police Order of
                  2002—promulgated by the then-president of Pakistan and providing protection under
                  the constitution in the 17th Amendment Act of 2003—replaced the Police Act of 1861.
                  While the Police Order of 2002 was a major step in the direction of a more democratic
                  police service, political interests, leaving many of its ambitions of becoming an
                  independent, trusted institution unrealised, hampered it. Over the past two decades,
                  however, political and economic instability and increasing security concerns—both
                  along its borders and internally—sparked renewed interest in improving the relationship
                  between the police and communities as a way to ensure peace and development in Pakistan.
                  Combined with the devolution of political power to the provinces, a space was created
                  for local police reform processes. Notably, the KP government introduced and implemented
                  the KP Police Act of 2017, which is the most advanced reform effort in the country.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e970">The Act both depoliticised the police and emphasised inclusive policing in the province
                  through community-oriented and gender-responsive policing. One primary purpose of
                  the KP Police Act of 2017 was to bridge the widened gap between the community and
                  police, allowing them to work in close coordination to fight crime. While not called
                  community-oriented policing per se, the components and intentions of the Act of 2017
                  are closely aligned with the main philosophy of COP. And while few respondents from
                  KP were aware of the term COP during our fieldwork in Pakistan, it was well known
                  and promoted by governmental and police officials serving at higher levels. In an
                  interview, a former director general of the National Police Bureau Islamabad defined
                  COP as an effort,
               </p>
               <p id="d1e972">
                  <i>to convert police from force to service. There is a widened gap between police and
                     the citizens. To gain citizens’ trust, police must be polite and lenient while dealing
                     with the common man, and COP is an effective tool in bringing positive changes in
                     the mindsets of both police and the community.</i>
                  
               </p>
               <p id="d1e977">The Act of 2017 consolidated several activities focused on improving relations between
                  the public and the police, including the establishment of DRCs and PLCs. These councils
                  are organised at the district level and consist of 21 members selected from local
                  communities, including civil service officers, lawyers, educators, youth, and other
                  notable local individuals. In fact, community members from Swat and Peshawar view
                  the new law as an endeavour to eliminate the fear that community members have of the
                  police and to maintain harmony in society while engaging both police and community
                  members (DRC Member-Local Community, Swat).
               </p>
               <p id="d1e979">PLCs in particular are important arenas for improving relations between youth and
                  police. In most of KP province, the police are working to incorporate young people
                  in various societal events to improve their mutual relations. Recently, the police
                  collaborated with UNDP and other civil departments to introduce PLCs in 10 conflict-affected
                  districts of KP province, including six districts of Malakand Division: Swat, Malakand,
                  Buner, Shangla, Dir Lower, Dir Upper and Chitral, Bannu, Kohat, and Dera Ismail Khan.
                  These councils comprise 30 members: 70% are local governmental representatives—mostly
                  elected young men—and 30% are reputable individuals from the local community [<a href="#R111">111</a>]. Data from the fieldwork in KP reveal that although these forums can, in theory,
                  include young women as well, they were in practice only open to male members of the
                  community because the prevailing culture and traditions did not allow women to participate
                  in any forums alongside men. The exception is in areas where CSOs have formed female
                  PLCs as a part of their competence building activities with the police.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e984">The PLCs organise events to provide platforms for both youth and the police to easily
                  interact, play games, and discuss local issues. For example, the Rahimabad police
                  station in Swat and areas under its jurisdiction organises monthly cricket matches
                  between the two groups. The most important factor in these games lies in the post-match
                  ceremonies, during which the local community expresses their grievances to the police
                  in a friendly environment. These complaints typically concern decision-making in developmental
                  projects, the harsh behaviour of security agencies, the provision of employment opportunities,
                  education, and healthcare services, and other issues. Most respondents appreciated
                  that such initiatives may improve police–community relationships as well as occupy
                  the youth with constructive activities and provide hope of ownership in confronting
                  local matters. Locals define these PLCs as a form of community-oriented policing because
                  the aims and objectives of this initiative contribute to the COP philosophy. A youth
                  respondent from Kabal, Swat, addressed their importance:
               </p>
               <p id="d1e986">
                  <i>I think interactions between youth and police should happen on a regular basis. I
                     prefer the involvement of the youth in regional matters as it is seen fruitful by
                     many. Numerous initiatives for bridging the gap and creating partnerships between
                     the police and the community have been and are still being taken up so far, but we
                     don’t see considerable results because eventually such initiatives are influenced
                     by the politicisation of the programmes or projects, sometimes by influential local
                     politicians or sometimes by police personnel. True sincerity can really be seen in
                     such endeavours. To bring peace and harmony in the community by partnering, the police–community
                     (relationship) needs strong leadership on the part of youth, commitment from the police
                     department, the sincerity of politicians, and non-intervention in civil affairs by
                     the army. However, I can hopefully say that the initiative of PLCs has the potential
                     to bring the desired results in terms of trusted community–police relationships.</i>
                  
               </p>
               <p id="d1e991">The members of the PLCs are empowered to issue warnings for the misuse of loudspeakers
                  in mosques and marketplaces, to verify the credentials of landlords and tenants, to
                  check tenant acknowledgement receipts, and to monitor the activities of released accused
                  or convicted persons and other antisocial elements [<a href="#R16">16</a>]. A respondent from Peshawar told us:
               </p>
               <p id="d1e996">
                  <i>The initiative of PLCs is beneficial for both the police and the youth; in this way
                     the police have been able to build a soft image since they were considered monsters
                     in the past by the common people. Now, in the current scenario and with such initiatives,
                     the police have the chance to interact with youth and other community members, and
                     the common people can interact with the police without any fear. Therefore, with the
                     launch of PLCs, the fear to face the police vanishes.’</i>
                  
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1001">These initiatives and activities have brought the police and youth together to overcome
                  local issues and proactively divert possible future avenues for conflict. Additionally,
                  these practices have had positive repercussions on police–community relationships
                  because youth have become aware of their rights, duties, and most importantly, their
                  role in the overall development of the region. Initiatives, such as PLCs, can mainstream
                  youth and collaborate with the police to maintain sustainable peace and security in
                  conflict-torn areas.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1004">However, during interviews with youth in the newly merged tribal districts, we learnt
                  that they are frustrated with the role the police assume in these areas. For example,
                  respondents complained that the police confront young activists in an unlawful manner
                  with an iron fist and act on orders from the Pakistani army and intelligence agencies.
                  Many activists have been arrested in cases with little legal standing, First Information
                  Reports (FIRs) have been lodged, and their names have been placed on exit control
                  lists. The youth argue that such behaviour from the police expands the gap between
                  them and the youth and that the various initiatives for bringing police and youth
                  together could be in vain.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1006">The data collected from youth in Pakistan’s Swat and Peshawar regions reveal that
                  they have many grievances against the government, local politicians, and security
                  agencies, including the police. They consider these bodies to be the sources of the
                  region’s insecurities, such as unemployment, ignorance, unawareness, apolitical attitudes
                  in the youth, illiteracy, poverty, and most significantly, a sense of deprivation
                  and marginalisation. Most respondents believe that in the recent past, the social
                  and political exclusion of youth caused and escalated conflict. Some young respondents
                  mentioned that the harsh and uncooperative behaviour of law enforcement agencies is
                  an underlying source of insecurity because, if this continues, then anti-state actors
                  can easily misguide youth. One young activist from Swat said:
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1008">
                  <i>All over the world, the youth are the soft target and first priority of such operations,
                     which creates uncertainty, insurgency, and insecurity. A similar situation was created
                     in Swat, too. Now we face a lot of insecurities in the area from the unfixable, rigid,
                     and uncooperative attitudes from law enforcement agencies currently operating in the
                     region.</i>
                  
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1013">Some respondents expressed that the government should properly heed the plight of
                  local youth because, if ignored further, they could overturn the status quo. A local
                  young man from Swat told us, ‘Now, as you know, the majority of the youth are marginalised
                  and poor, so they can become easy targets to be radicalised—not by religiously motivated
                  narratives this time around but rather by politically motivated narratives. For example,
                  nationalists, liberals, and other factions of political parties can misguide them.’
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1015">Some youth respondents were optimistic regarding local young people’s political activism,
                  which could be a source of awareness on regional and geostrategic matters. This awareness
                  has provided them a resource to overpower the ways and means of radicalisation. Notably,
                  most youth respondents posited that people can no longer be misguided by misinterpreted
                  versions of religion; as the people of Swat have been misguided three times on such
                  a basis, this is now impossible to repeat. A youth activist from Swat stated,
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1017">
                  <i>Swat has experienced several phases of religious radicalisation in the past, first
                     in the late 1980s, then in 1994–95 by Sufi Muhammad’s Tehreek-i-Nafaz-e-Shariat-e-Muhammadi,
                     and most recently by Maulana Fazlullah Tehrik-e-Taliban from 2005 to 2009. Our youth
                     have participated in all movements where religion has been used as a tool to attract
                     them, and the pioneers and engineers of these movements achieved implicit agendas.
                     Now, the youth of the region have discovered these ill-fated agendas, and they can
                     never be misguided by religion.</i>
                  
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1022">Since the beginning of 2018, youth in Pashtun-dominated areas—especially in the newly
                  merged tribal districts as well as in the adjacent cities of Bannu, Karak, Dera Ismail
                  Khan, Peshawar, and parts of Baluchistan—have been actively demanding their due rights
                  from the government and armed forces of Pakistan. During the fieldwork in Peshawar,
                  we further learnt that youth (social activists) are more frightened of the state’s
                  security agencies than of militants. Young people hailing from the newly merged tribal
                  districts expressed their views that, on the one hand, the youth movement is providing
                  people with the courage to claim their basic human rights and justification of the
                  military operations conducted in tribal areas since 9/11; on the other hand, they
                  frequently face harassment, arrest, abduction, and targeted killings from security
                  agencies, and police are at the forefront of these problems. They criticised the role
                  that the police have assumed in post-conflict areas; for example, the respondents
                  complained that police confront young activists in an unlawful way with an iron fist
                  and acting on orders from the Pakistani army and intelligence agencies. The youth
                  argued that such behaviour from police can expand the gap between them and the youth,
                  jeopardising the initiatives for bringing them together. In an interview with the
                  director general of the National Police Bureau in Islamabad Pakistan (NPB), we were
                  told the following:
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1024">
                  <i>NPB is developing curricula for police schools; for example, they will start the initiative
                     in the National Police Academy Islamabad. The institution will bring together people
                     from all segments of society: media, community elders, politicians, police, and academia
                     in order to make COPs an effective tool to bring harmony, peace, and prosperity for
                     all. International communities are also striving to incorporate COPs in police departments
                     and make them an effective tool that could bring police and communities together.
                     Various national and international organisations are working closely with police and
                     other departments. UNDP, Coffey International, Department for International Development
                     (DFID), UKAID, Centre for Peace and Development Initiatives (CPDI), and Home and Tribal
                     Affairs Department KP are working together to incorporate COPs in the system. Various
                     workshops and seminars have been conducted with the police, local administration,
                     the prison and prosecution department, and local communities in order to sensitise
                     the idea of COPs.</i>
                  
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1029">In this respect, the PLCs are not the only option for community–police interaction.
                  Section 168 of the Police Order of 2002 provided for the establishment of CPLCs to
                  perform certain functions that could lead to institutionalising COP in Pakistan [<a href="#R112">112</a>]. A CPLC is ‘a non-political statutory institution, operationally independent and
                  managed by dedicated and concerned citizens offering their honorary services to bridge
                  the gap between communities and police’ [<a href="#R113">113</a>]. The foremost difference between CPLCs and PLCs is that the former are formal and
                  the latter are informal in exercising their activities regarding police–community
                  relations; however, the aims and objectives of both are to establish police–community
                  partnerships to combat crime and resolve societal issues.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1037">CPLCs are considered another initiative that can make the police and youth collaborate
                  to curb crime and violence. To date, CPLCs are functional in Karachi and Lahore [<a href="#R93">93</a>] Provincial Public Safety (PPS) and the Police Complaint Commission (PCC) in KP are
                  attempting to establish CPLCs in each district of the province, but previous governments
                  in KP have thus far ignored this requirement. The provincial government of KP, however,
                  is planning to initiate a CPLC soon, and CPLCs are one of their prime objectives [<a href="#R114">114</a>]. Three women are to be included in each committee, and members have been nominated.
                  Initially, no specific number of members was legally specified for the liaison committee,
                  but authorities decided to restrict it to 10. The CPLCs are not only to work as trust-building
                  bodies but also to bridge the communication gap between the public and the police.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1045">The police in KP now consider youth to be a means to fight radicalisation, crime,
                  and drug addiction, and they engage youth representatives in interactive sessions
                  with officers from across the province to encourage them to fight crime [<a href="#R115">115</a>]. PLCs are playing an important role in this interactive engagement. These interaction
                  sessions are held as meetings between police personnel and local youth, awareness
                  sessions across districts, and workshops to build capacity in both police and youth.
                  These sessions are useful for sensitising youth on various police initiatives such
                  as DRCs, police access services, police assistance lines, and efforts to improve police
                  behaviour at a police station level. Such cooperative efforts between the police and
                  civil society can further build and strengthen trust relations among various actors.
                  Since they also allow police to better understand the insecurities that the youth
                  face, the police respond in a more appropriate manner that builds trust rather than
                  threatening it.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e1051">Notably, Cuesta et al. (2007), Peters et al. (2003), and Bihler et al. (2015) have
                  discussed the importance of participatory grassroots projects in reducing violence,
                  crime, and gang activities among young people in their research from Cali in Colombia,
                  Bo in Sierra Leone, and Central America (El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Honduras),
                  respectively. Through positive intervention programmes and social development activities,
                  such as training workshops, family meetings, festivals, sports activities, church
                  groups, civic messages, youth education, micro enterprise programmes, and efforts
                  from the private sector, youth can be lured away from crime and violence. The cooperation
                  and collective participation of citizens, CSOs, police, the justice system, and local
                  authorities are key factors in such preventive work [<a href="#R116">116</a>, <a href="#R117">117</a>, <a href="#R118">118</a>]. Similarly, Moser and van Bronkhorst (1999) mentioned the importance of community
                  policing programmes, such as implementing after-school sports activities, hosting
                  homework clubs run by community police officers, and picking up school dropouts and
                  taking them to school, which can enhance trust building between the community and
                  the police ([<a href="#R105">105</a>], pp.&nbsp;14-15).

            <p id="d1e1068">As we have discussed, in both Nimruz and KP provinces, some primary drivers of insecurity
               are unemployment, poverty, drug abuse, corruption, and a host of societal challenges
               that youth confront daily. In Nimruz province, addiction is viewed as the predominant
               enemy of the youth. Many of our respondents, both young men and women, stressed that
               unemployment leads to illegal migration and drug abuse, which further leads to the
               destruction of youth’s lives in the community, and many families have been haunted
               by this vicious circle. Interviews with young people revealed similar histories of
               poverty, unemployment, migration, and drug abuse as central to people’s everyday experiences.
               Migration, drug abuse, and drug peddling are substantial challenges to the local inhabitants
               and the police. Other risk factors that affect youth and increase pressure in their
               lives are different forms of urban violence, such as theft, gangs, terrorist attacks
               or bombings, and police harassment.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e1070">Our data show how livelihood security and personal security are closely interconnected.
               Both cases show that drug abuse is complex. One of the major reasons for youth involvement
               in the drug trade is to support their livelihoods; however, they also succumb to the
               use of drugs, which again affects their security. Livelihood security is paramount
               to understanding the interconnected nature of drug trade and abuse. The cases show
               how drugs become coping strategies for the vulnerabilities that youth face, namely
               unemployment and corruption, and how these in turn become risk factors with law-and-order
               issues between communities and the police.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e1072">As we have argued, the factors that drive young people to vulnerability, exclusion,
               and frustration are common to both young women and men; however, young girls and women
               face additional challenges that increase their vulnerability. Understanding the gender
               dynamics within the context of insecurity is critical. Our case studies demonstrate
               that the nature of insecurity that young women face is both public and private. In
               the public sphere, young girls face restrictions from family members, who prevent
               them from attending school or force them to leave school at an early age. The reasons
               vary from fear of walking alone to school to dangers of sexual harassment or being
               kidnapped. For young women, employment is another significant challenge; many women
               feel the pressure of sexual harassment from their male colleagues and become targets
               of threats and attacks in their workplaces, thereby forcing them to either quit or
               find another job.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e1074">In both Afghanistan and Pakistan, gender-based violence in the private sphere is a
               primary cause of insecurity among young girls and women, and issues related to young
               girls, women, and marriage are at the heart of the family or tribe’s honour and dignity.
               Harmful practices, including child marriage, baad (exchange of young girls in conflict
               resolution cases), honour killings, and forced marriages, significantly limit the
               participation of young girls and women in many spheres of life. Young boys are also
               exposed to violence through the practice of bacha bazi, where rich and powerful men
               and even the police sexually exploit poor, young boys caught in the net of poverty,
               family pressure, desire for economic gain, cultural traditions, violence, and abuse.
               Cultural norms of honour and shame that particularly pervade women’s daily lives do
               not allow them or their family members to seek advice or report cases to external
               institutions such as the police. Furthermore, people either do not trust the police
               or view them as corrupt; hence, few seek their assistance [<a href="#R119">119</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e1079">Youth and police relations in many countries are often complex and problematic, as
               police perceive youth as either perpetrators or victims of crime. In post-conflict
               settings, these relations are additionally difficult, as societal trust is brittle.
               In both Afghanistan and Pakistan, police–community relations are challenging, and
               trust is low. Many challenges that we have discussed regarding youth—whether economic,
               social, cultural, or political—are closely interconnected to issues of safety and
               security and, hence, are linked to law-and-order issues and police involvement. Despite
               these difficulties, maintaining peace and stability with the young community depends
               on the police understanding youth insecurities and responding appropriately to their
               safety and security needs. Without community involvement, police efforts towards trust
               building and support are futile. COP is an important policing approach that we have
               discussed. The operationalisation of COP lies in building trust and interacting with
               communities in a collaborative manner; its strength is in its responsiveness and accountability
               and in the engagement of communities to determine appropriate and sustainable local
               solutions.

            <p id="d1e1081">Our field data from KP province demonstrate that PLCs are an important COP initiative
               in which police and youth meet to discuss their mutual concerns regarding safety,
               security, developmental issues, and police misconduct in a safe space. Games and sports
               become important arenas for such mutual interactions. CPLCs are another such initiative
               in which youth and police connect to discuss issues pertaining to conflict resolution,
               political mobilisation, unemployment, crime, terrorism, and radicalisation. The police
               in KP have also introduced DRCs—alternative dispute resolution forums in which victims,
               offenders, and the community meet to discuss and provide reconciliation to the concerned
               parties in a dispute. However, a significant drawback for many of these initiatives
               is that the participation of young women is limited. Nevertheless, such initiatives
               are important in enabling communities and the police to interact without hostility,
               build trust, and mutually support each other to create safety and security in local
               environments.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e1083">In Afghanistan, the establishment of PCCSs is an important step in creating a meeting
               place in which the police and community members can interact without tension. As previously
               discussed, the <i>shuras</i> are key meeting venues for the police and government representatives to meet with
               community members and discuss issues concerning safety, security, and development.
               For youth, they provide opportunities to communicate their worries and problems to
               both governmental officials and the police. Within the context of human security and
               COP, FRUs and PWCs are important bodies contributing to justice and security for women
               in a small way.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e1088">The role of CSOs in building bridges of trusting relationships between youth and the
               police is crucial if COP is to be effective and successful in post conflict contexts.
               Our case examples from Afghanistan and Pakistan illustrate the importance of CSOs’
               successful participation with the local police in various community-based projects
               that enhance fruitful partnerships, relations, and trust for future collaborations.
               Projects aimed at young children and youth, such as safety outreach programmes; first
               aid traffic safety instructions; the dangers of mines, floods, and earthquakes; joint
               sports programmes; and football and cricket matches are some of the activities that
               open lines of communication and mutual understanding regarding issues of safety and
               security. Serious subjects, including criminal activities, drugs, extremism, and terrorism,
               in which the youth are susceptible to becoming involved, are addressed in a non-threatening
               manner. Similarly, youth share their problems, challenges, and grievances with the
               police. The participatory nature of these projects simplifies cooperation and knowledge
               transfer. An area for future research, especially in post-conflict settings, is the
               role of civil society–driven initiatives in community–police engagement.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e1090">By keeping in mind the fragile relations between the police and citizens in post-conflict
               societies, such a grassroots approach can go a long way in creating small steps for
               cooperation and trust building. In Nimruz and KP, PLCs, CPLCs, PeM, and PCCSs are
               high-impact participatory arenas for facilitating dialogue and cooperation among all
               stakeholders. The primary challenge is that this effort must be viewed as a priority
               and an important aspect of COP.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e1092">A common thread that has been voiced throughout this paper is the interconnectedness
               of the insecurities that youth are exposed to in these case countries and in post-conflict
               societies more generally. We have examined how young people’s lives are shaped by
               their access to economic advantages and opportunities, as well as to education and
               health services, illustrating how these influence their lives. Additionally, we have
               addressed how they can actively participate in processes, including policing, voice
               their concerns, and be part of the decision-making that affects their lives. Our data
               present how young people discuss the challenges that they meet and what they require
               to better their livelihoods; as we have discussed, most of these challenges concern
               security issues and connect to broader aspects of human security. Moreover, the data
               demonstrate that livelihood security issues are closely connected to personal security
               and the effects on communities of young women and men and that the police are critical
               in contributing to human security rather than being a source of insecurity.

                           government, USA, NATO, and the regional powers such as China, Pakistan, India and
                           Russia are trying to facilitate a peace process to end the ongoing war. Negotiations
                           have been taking place since 2018. However, despite the peace talks intensified insurgent
                           attacks by the Taliban continue to this day. Wikipedia: Afghan Peace Process: \urlhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan\_peace\_process]

                           is also an important coping strategy for young Afghans to get away from poverty and
                           unemployment. Given the limited scope and focus of our paper, we cannot cover this
                           topic in its entirety. UNHCR estimate that about 3.5 million people are Internally
                           Displaced People (IDPs). Iran and Pakistan host nearly 90 per cent of displaced Afghans
                           - more than two million registered Afghan refugees in total. Some 65 per cent of the
                           Afghan population – in and outside of Afghanistan – are children and young people.
