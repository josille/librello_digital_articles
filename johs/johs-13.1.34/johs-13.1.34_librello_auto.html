                                 continues to receive international attention. The main debate has been on the accommodation
                                 of refugees in European countries and the issues that arise from the sudden influx
                                 of people into those countries. Camps were established with limited time and information
                                 to prepare, leading to issues within these temporary living arrangements. Conditions
                                 are worse for women refugees, who suffer similarly to the men but have higher rates
                                 of insecurity. This paper attempts to argue for greater protection for women refugees.
                                 To do so, it will describe women refugees’ conditions and needs and relate them to
                                 an enforced moral responsibility. It argues for more attention to be given to women
                                 refugees with specific conditions, those who have been marginalized in most refugee
                                 policies. The main argument is that better protection for and empowerment of women
                                 refugees is urgently needed due to their own conditions and needs alongside the moral
                                 obligations to take care of children and the elderly. To do so, policies have to consult
                                 the specific needs of women. An important step towards this effort is to develop further
                                 and more detailed classification of women and their specific needs: women refugees’
                                 needs are not merely determined by their own conditions but also the conditions of
                                 those they are responsible for.</span></div>

                              <p id="d1e90">The current influx of refugees into Europe has been considered the worst refugee crisis
                                 since the Second World War [<a href="#R01">1</a>]. Significant amounts of humanitarian assistance are needed to help the refugees.
                                 The worst conditions are experienced during their journey from their origin country
                                 to countries in Europe. Camp sites and hot spots have been established to accommodate
                                 and assist them. Nevertheless, even in these supposedly safer grounds, they have to
                                 face challenges. The challenges are even bigger for women refugees, who are considered
                                 to be more vulnerable because they are prone to Sexual and Gender-Based Violence (SGBV),
                                 become trafficked or exploited, and moreover, they have an enforced moral responsibility
                                 to be the caregivers of their family members. It is reported by both Amnesty International
                                 [<a href="#R02">2</a>] and CARE International [<a href="#R03">3</a>] that women and girl refugees face sexual and gender-based violence including assault,
                                 exploitation and sexual harassment at every stage of their journey, from when they
                                 were still in their country of origin to arrival and settlement on European soil.
                                 It is even reported that they are forced to engage in “transactional sex to ‘pay for’
                                 travel documents or their journey” [<a href="#R04">4</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e104">There are initiatives from women refugees to organize themselves through informal
                                 community centers with the purpose of supporting the delivery of aid. Initiatives
                                 have been started by women refugees who formed groups “to support with the delivery
                                 of aid, such as establishing informal community centres for women and children”. As
                                 an example, women refugees in Athens established the ‘Melissa’ women’s centre that
                                 offers “a safe space for refugee women to socialize, learn languages and gain vocational
                                 training”. However, governments and UN agencies have failed to support those efforts
                                 [<a href="#R05">5</a>]; and these initiatives are still limited and the majority of women are still in
                                 need of assistances.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e109">The problems faced by women refugees are multi-layered based on their gender. The
                                 biological characteristics and role of women mean their needs differ from those of
                                 men. These are then related with their other needs such as social and psychological
                                 ones. Having a monthly period and being the gender partner that has to deal with pregnancy
                                 are already specific needs which have to be fulfilled regularly. Even more so, women
                                 refugees can be categorized further based on their conditions and the responsibilities
                                 they bear for being caregivers for their children and the elderly. An effort has been
                                 made by the European Union [<a href="#R06">6</a>], to categorize women refugees by classifying them into: single mother traveling
                                 alone or with her children, pregnant women, teenager girls (with and without babies),
                                 unaccompanied children or even newly-married girls. As the issue develops, this categorization
                                 seems to be inadequate to identify their specific needs, which is crucial in the effort
                                 of determining suitable actions. Therefore, this paper aims to expand this categorization
                                 by taking into consideration the latest developments, particularly at the camp sites
                                 where assistance is usually concentrated.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e114">Once problems and needs have been identified, the next concern is whether the policies
                                 adequately address the actual needs and conditions in the field. Institutions such
                                 as the European Union (EU), the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR),
                                 Women’s Refugee Commission and a number of European countries have made efforts to
                                 assist the refugees through policies and guidelines. However, the recent conditions
                                 of women refugees, particularly in Europe, shows that there is still a lack of protection
                                 is still happening. In this context, this paper attempts to analyze the challenges
                                 to implementing refugee-related policies.

                              <p id="d1e119">Research on women refugees has extensively discussed the problems faced by women refugees.
                                 A number of studies have tried to identify and list those problems and the efforts
                                 made to address them in mostly ad verbatim reports. Langlois et al [<a href="#R07">7</a>], for example, identified that refugees are likely to have health issues such as
                                 mental health illness, trauma, and physical problems like injuries, epilepsy, malnutrition,
                                 anemia, non-communicable diseases, infectious diseases (hepatitis A and B), and even
                                 parasitic diseases, which require better access to healthcare. Another analysis argues
                                 that women refugees should not only be seen as victims because they have the potentials
                                 to be proactive actors. With regard to women refugees, the Women’s Refugee Commission
                                 [<a href="#R08">8</a>] recently published a report on the condition of women and girl refugees en route
                                 to the destination country, which states that women refugees are often unable to get

                              <p id="d1e127">Another study conducted by the European Union [<a href="#R06">6</a>] also identified issues faced by women refugees. For instance, the condition in shelters,
                                 training and language courses, labor market, healthcare system, gender-based violence
                                 and trafficking. This was also identified in the motion for a European Parliament
                                 Resolution on the situation of women refugees and asylum seekers in the EU, “more
                                 than a third of maternity-related deaths worldwide take place in crisis settings,
                                 such as refugee camps” which are caused by “lack of access to basic emergency obstetric
                                 care and skilled health personnel” [<a href="#R09">9</a>]. It has also been reported that men and women refugees have to sleep in the same
                                 tents and have to use the same toilet and shower facilities [<a href="#R10">10</a>]. Amnesty International also reported that many women refugees try to minimize the
                                 risk of being assaulted in the camps by not drinking or eating so they would not have
                                 to use the toilet, some others also left the camps and slept in the open because they
                                 felt safer there [<a href="#R10">10</a>]. A worker at the aid station also mentioned that many women refugees suffer from
                                 urinary tract infections because “they drink too little, the toilets are not clean
                                 and they’re not used to the cold”. Pregnant women refugees also “exposed to a lot
                                 of stress, had to stand in lines for a long time and being crushed in crowds”.

                              <p id="d1e141">A study of women refugees’ opportunities and constraints, particularly in the United
                                 Kingdom, by Hunt [<a href="#R11">11</a>], has actually argued that women refugees are able to engage with the activities
                                 in the destination country, not only towards self-development but also to get involved
                                 in preparing future arrivals of other refugees. It is also argued that women did not
                                 categorize themselves as victims, but as agents who could offer improvements for refugees
                                 [<a href="#R11">11</a>]. However, this more empowered role of women refugees is only partially achieved,
                                 depending on the cases, the locations and the policies implemented.

                              <p id="d1e149">Even though studies from various perspectives focus on women refugees, there is still
                                 a lack of identification of the different needs of protection for women refugees.
                                 By identifying their specific needs of protection, a more effective level of support
                                 and assistance could be delivered to them as an effort towards protection and empowerment
                                 them. Therefore, this paper will take a look at the different statuses of women refugees
                                 and analyze the different needs of protection for each category. Using data from previous
                                 studies, this paper attempts to map the needs of women refugees based on their status
                                 and condition and analyze whether existing policies can be utilized to address the
                                 issues. This paper focuses on the imbalance in the condition of protecting and being
                                 protected for women refugees. It is assumed that women refugees’ needs and protection
                                 cannot be optimally fulfilled because, as women, they also have to fulfil the needs
                                 and protect the individuals under their care.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e151">As documented by CARE International in 2016, women refugees’ burdens are heavier because
                                 of their increased responsibility, meaning that women refugees do not only have to
                                 take care of themselves, but also they have to shoulder the responsibility of taking
                                 care of the children they are travelling with [<a href="#R12">12</a>]. Therefore, we argue that there should be special attention given to the identification
                                 and fulfilment of the needs and the protection of these individuals because they are
                                 considered as the extension of the woman’s needs and protections. Identification of
                                 their needs will help or assist the women in fulfilling their obligations and allow
                                 them to take care of themselves. We also argue for more attention to be paid to women
                                 with certain physical and mental disabilities, mainly because they are not as capable
                                 in fulfilling their needs and protecting themselves.

                              <p id="d1e159">The number and gender of refugees entering Europe changed significantly over a single
                                 year. In 2015, 70% of the refugees were men, however in 2016, 60% of the refugees
                                 were women and children [<a href="#R13">13</a>]. This data shows that there is a significant increase in the number of women and
                                 children among the refugees. However, it should be noted that they are taking the
                                 same journey as male refugees and experiencing similar challenges, especially during
                                 the journey to European soil. Women and children refugees together with men have to
                                 survive during a long journey over sea and land, day and night without proper equipment
                                 or survival kits, leaving them to survive on their own in order to arrive at their
                                 destination country. It is even worse for women and children because they are more
                                 vulnerable to be trafficked or exploited. As described by the Commissioner for Human
                                 Rights [<a href="#R13">13</a>], the increasing number of women and children refugees also means that more women
                                 and children are risking their lives on the route to Europe, which makes them vulnerable
                                 to be trafficked, exploited, discriminated and abused.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e167">Women refugees need more attention not only because of the past experiences that they
                                 have been through, but also because of the moral obligations that they carry. Women
                                 refugees who take the risk to travel with their family have to resume their ‘natural’
                                 role within the family setting. As wives and mothers, besides taking care of themselves,
                                 they also need to take care of their husbands, children or the elderly who are travelling
                                 with them. Taking these responsibilities in a refugee situation increases their burden.
                                 Also, in many cases, women have to take the role as the head of the household [<a href="#R14">14</a>]. Women refugees are also more vulnerable in the refugee camps, where harsh conditions
                                 are faced and there is a high risk of abuses, including rape.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e172">The increasing number of women refugees means that more assistance is needed to fulfil
                                 their needs. However, the needs of women refugees from one to another based on their
                                 conditions. The specific needs and conditions require particular responses. For instance,
                                 women who are pregnant need more medical assistance to ensure that they will be in
                                 a good physical condition before giving birth. On the other hand, women who experienced
                                 SGBV need specific psychological and medical assistance to heal their trauma. In order
                                 to overcome this problem, several efforts have been made to provide more assistance
                                 for women refugees, these include formulating more policies aiming at assisting women
                                 refugees and providing more medical assistance in the field. However, as stated in
                                 an assessment conducted by the United Nations High Commission of Refugees (UNHCR),
                                 United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and Women’s Refugee Commission [<a href="#R15">15</a>], responses from governments, humanitarian actors, EU institutions and agencies,
                                 and CSOs are inadequate.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e177">The UNHCR also stated that effective protection responses are needed, particularly
                                 for vulnerable refugees [<a href="#R06">6</a>]. This report has included women as vulnerable. However, as the situation develops,
                                 it becomes more obvious that there needs to be a greater spectrum in this classification
                                 to accommodate the various conditions faced by women. It is proposed that single adult
                                 refugee women are believed to be the most vulnerable among all refugees because of
                                 their lack of financial means, professional qualifications and family support [<a href="#R06">6</a>]. Therefore, it is necessary to determine the specific needs of women refugees, in
                                 order to improve protection for them. This could be achieved by categorizing women
                                 refugees based on their conditions.

                              <p id="d1e188">The discussion in this paper is focused on conditions in refugee camps. In many cases,
                                 refugees have to spend long periods of time living in camps until their refugee status
                                 is granted and their settlement is decided. This extended period of living in a temporary
                                 setting with limited facilities makes refugees, particularly the women, vulnerable.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e190">The destination countries which the refugees try to reach are mostly located in the
                                 center of Europe. As a consequence, there are countries which are considered to be
                                 the front line [<a href="#R16">16</a>, <a href="#R17">17</a>, <a href="#R18">18</a>] because geographically they are located on the route to the destination countries.
                                 Italy, Greece and Turkey, for example, are the entry points for refugees heading to
                                 Germany or other central European countries. Therefore, it is important to examine
                                 the conditions of women refugees in the camps provided in these countries. Whether
                                 the specific needs of women refugees are met and specific forms of protections offered
                                 remains to be analyzed.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e201">It is reported that there is a lack of protection and assistance in regard to women
                                 refugees’ physical safety, dignity and health [<a href="#R19">19</a>]. For instance, in Germany, separate houses and medical care are provided for vulnerable
                                 groups which include pregnant women and traumatized women. However, due to the large
                                 number of these women, the facilities are not adequate to accommodate all of them.
                                 Another example is the in refugee camp in Greece, where camp which was planned to
                                 host 2,500 people is actually inhabited by around 12,000 people, all living in inhumane
                                 conditions such as muddy tents that make them vulnerable to diseases and mental illness.
                                 As raised by the United Nations, the Red Cross, and Save the Children, there are also
                                 concerns about food shortages, shelter, sanitary, and water conditions in the refugee
                                 camps. Similar conditions occur in Italy, where men and women refugees, including
                                 single parents with children, and pregnant women and children both in good and poor
                                 health, are forced to live in the same building and given the same treatment [<a href="#R20">20</a>].

                                 and trained to give psychological first aid by humanitarian agencies, they are still
                                 insufficient to meet the varied and frequent cases. In addition, UNHCR also reported
                                 that there is a lack of informal and formal referral mechanisms, standard operating
                                 procedures (SOP) and clinical management of rape (CMR) available for women refugees.
                                 More importantly, a lack of “uniformly applicable vulnerability criteria that all
                                 actors are aware of” hampers the process of screening, identification and prioritization
                                 of women with specific needs [<a href="#R21">21</a>].

                                 abuses, conflicts or aggression and they are unable to receive protection from their
                                 own government. Therefore, international protection is needed to ensure their rights.
                                 The guideline also mentions that women share the needs for protection like other refugees,
                                 however women and girl refugees have “special protection needs that reflect their
                                 gender, inter alia, protection against manipulation, sexual and physical abuse and
                                 exploitation, and protection against sexual discrimination in the delivery of goods
                                 and services.” The fulfillment of these special protection needs is considered here
                                 as women refugees’ specific needs. Therefore, in order to actually address the problems
                                 faced by women refugees, it is important to determine what the specific needs are.

                                 by certain categories of women refugees. It is also argued that the term “one size

                                 needs and protection are required by women refugees. Since women refugees have different
                                 health conditions and recent traumatic life experiences, their needs for protection
                                 should not be generalized and simplified. Instead, needs should be differentiated
                                 based on their experience and their current conditions between one characteristic
                                 and another. It is believed that specific needs could be better fulfilled by making
                                 the categorization of women refugees more specific. The categorization of women refugees
                                 is the first step in identifying the specific needs of women refugees and towards
                                 ensuring that their specific needs are being fulfilled.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e230">Furthermore, the conditions of women are very much determined by important confounding
                                 factors other than their own person, which also vary greatly. As an example, a lot
                                 of women refugees are travelling with their children. Their needs are not solely be
                                 diapers and powdered milk. Children could further be categorized into babies, toddlers,
                                 preschoolers or even teenagers who obviously have different needs to fulfil. Women
                                 refugees who are travelling with babies may need diapers, milk, varied forms of foodstuffs
                                 and vaccines for their babies; while those who are travelling with preschoolers have
                                 different specific needs such as books, toys, and vitamins. Therefore, in order to
                                 provide appropriate assistance, the needs should be broken down to the maximum extent.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e232">There are many ways of specifically categorizing women based on their needs and conditions.
                                 UNHCR, UNFPA and WRC [<a href="#R21">21</a>], for example, argue that women refugees who are in need and required more coordinative
                                 and effective protection responses include single women travelling alone or with children,
                                 pregnant and lactating women, adolescent girls, unaccompanied children, newly wedded
                                 children with and without their babies, and elderly men and women. While the European
                                 Union [<a href="#R06">6</a>] mentioned single mothers who travel alone or also with her children, pregnant women,
                                 teenage girls (with and without babies), unaccompanied children or even newly-married
                                 girls. This paper adds to the existing categorization of women refugees by assessing
                                 the specific needs and protections that need to be fulfilled. We are adding women
                                 refugees who experienced SGBV, elderly women, women refugees with disabilities, woman
                                 refugees with toddlers, women refugees with children, women refugees with teenagers
                                 and women refugees with mental illness to the existing list. The following discussion
                                 will further highlight the double role that most women refugees have to play and their
                                 obligations to protect those that they are responsible for.

                                    <p id="d1e243">First, we would like to highlight the needs of women refugees who are travelling with
                                       older children. Children in general need good nutrition to grow, which is a challenge
                                       to provide in a refugee situation. As reported by UNICEF (2014) [<a href="#R23">23</a>], thousands of Syrian refugee children suffered severe acute malnutrition, which
                                       were linked to “poor hygiene, unsafe drinking water, the cold season, lack of immunization,
                                       diseases and improper infant and young child feeding practices”. This issue of inadequate
                                       nutrition for refugees was still confirmed by CARE in 2016. According to the interviews
                                       with women refugees living in a refugee camp in Greece which is reported by CARE International
                                       [<a href="#R24">24</a>], they live on lentil soup that leads to a lack of nutrition for women refugees travelling
                                       with babies and children. These efforts to consult women refugees as a specific group
                                       need to be maintained and developed further so that their actual needs can be identified.
                                       The information will then be useful in the process of making specific aid policies.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e251">As an international organization focusing on children, Save the Children [<a href="#R25">25</a>] has conducted efforts to help women refugees who are travelling with their children.
                                       They have identified that women refugees who make the journey with babies need to
                                       have access to baby kits. They have identified the specific needs for the babies.
                                       We would suggest that the provision of needs and protection for babies and older children
                                       should be differentiated. Toddlers, for example, need open, child-friendly spaces
                                       that allow them to play and socialize safely. While for children in their teens, the
                                       prioritized needs may include access to education and learning equipment. As for the
                                       protection, the challenges are also different. Movement is limited for babies, while
                                       for toddlers and teenagers the risk of getting separated from the mother can be high.
                                       Therefore, there is a need for refugee camps to have safe spaces for children to play
                                       and socialize. Save the Children in Italy [<a href="#R25">25</a>] has initiated the setting up of child-friendly spaces, not only for playing but
                                       also to release stress.

                                    <p id="d1e262">Elderly women refugees are considered as vulnerable because of their physical condition,
                                       they need assistance in fulfilling their specific needs and protecting themselves.
                                       A number of reports have considered the elderly to be part of the vulnerable group.
                                       However, they tend to be invisible and left behind in the refugee assistance scheme,
                                       as compared to women and children. As written in older reports on refugees [<a href="#R26">26</a>, <a href="#R27">27</a>] elderly women tend to be left behind in the camps because of their limitations.
                                       They are not given priority thus their needs are not comprehensively identified. Physically
                                       they may need assistance similar to those with disabilities, such as walking sticks
                                       or wheelchairs. Mentally, they may need specific treatment because their age influences
                                       the way they experience the refugee condition. Older age and longer attachment to
                                       the country of origin may make it harder for elderly refugees to adjust to the living
                                       conditions in the camps. Thus, they need other individuals to accompany them through
                                       the process.

                                    <p id="d1e273">Women refugees with disabilities need assistance and support equipment such as wheelchairs.
                                       However, their needs do not stop there. As argued by the Women’s Refugee Commission
                                       [<a href="#R28">28</a>], women refugees with disabilities tend to face high risk of sexual and gender-based
                                       violence because of three factors, which are: being female, disabled and displaced.
                                       Unfortunately, just like the elderly women refugees, women refugees with disabilities
                                       often become invisible because they tend to be kept inside. This condition makes them
                                       become more isolated. Furthermore, as it is difficult for them to move around, they
                                       tend to be left by themselves, making them vulnerable to rape or acts of SGBV. Their
                                       physical limitations may prevent them from defending themselves or seeking help.

                                    <p id="d1e281">Specific attention should also be given to pregnant women refugees who experienced
                                       SGBV. It has been argued that pregnant women need special assistance. The urgency
                                       rises when we are talking about women refugees who have become pregnant as a result
                                       of SGBVs. Besides the standard medical assistance required by pregnant women, this
                                       group of women refugees need specific assistance such as psychologists or psychiatrists
                                       to help them through the pregnancy and labor process. As argued by UNHCR, UNFPA and
                                       WRC [<a href="#R29">29</a>], more “comprehensive multi-sectoral SGBV prevention and response services are needed.”
                                       It is highlighted that just like other SGBV victims, those who are raped or sexually
                                       abused in the refugee camps tend to choose not to report the cases, which makes it
                                       more difficult to calculate the exact number of victims and, more importantly, to
                                       determine the type of assistance they need. The decision to not report the rape is
                                       usually because victims feel too ashamed of the incidents and they tend to disclose
                                       their experience only to seek help and assistance after they have begun to suffer
                                       severe and visible health implications. As reported by UNHCR [<a href="#R21">21</a>], one of the biggest challenges among women refugees’ specific needs is the fact
                                       that SGBV is not considered as a major feature of the crisis due to the lack of data
                                       in SGBV incidents. UNHCR also reported that this fact means the number of actual survivors
                                       or victims remains hidden, which is a challenge for government and humanitarian agencies
                                       in addressing what kind of specific needs and assistance are required.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e289">In addition, the language barrier is also one of the reasons why the victims are reluctant
                                       to report what happened to them. More female interpreters are needed in the refugee
                                       camps in order to approach women refugees and help in assessing their condition. Personal
                                       approaches, particularly by someone who can speak the same language, may make the
                                       victims more comfortable and more likely to report the crimes they have suffered.
                                       When the victims are open to share their experiences and their feelings, it will be
                                       easier for the humanitarian officers to determine what kind of medical or psychological
                                       assistance they need. In addition, by understanding the pattern, humanitarian assistance
                                       can be more specifically designed to provide preventive actions that could decrease
                                       potential SGBV cases in the refugee camps.
                                       
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e291">Protection from potential SGBV is also important because, due to the high number of
                                       people living in the camps, women refugees are at risk of being raped or sexually
                                       abused not only by other refugees but also from the humanitarian actors and guards
                                       [<a href="#R29">29</a>, <a href="#R30">30</a>]. The high risk of SGBV in refugee camps is also due to the insufficient number of
                                       beds, poor hygiene conditions, and poor shower installations without separation between
                                       men and women. Therefore, protection needs to be increased by conducting more monitoring
                                       activity around the camp areas. Moreover, more SGBV coordinators are needed in refugee
                                       camps, especially those who are dedicated and skilled protection officers.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e299">Another crucial condition that needs to be taken into account is the mental health
                                       of women refugees. It is commonly known that the pregnancy experience in a normal
                                       condition can already trigger mental health issues for women. As stated by WHO [<a href="#R31">31</a>], “mental health problems such as depression and anxiety are very common during pregnancy
                                       and after childbirth in all parts of the world”. As argued by Zahira Latif [<a href="#R32">32</a>], maternal mental health, if experienced in a situation where the women have to be
                                       on the move, will prevent them from seeking help due to practical barriers and cultural
                                       factors. Furthermore, women who are pregnant because of SGBV will eventually have
                                       to deal with her relationship with the child she is bearing. This is a type of issue
                                       which requires a rather extended treatment, something which may be rather difficult
                                       to provide in a refugee situation.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e307">The discussion above has emphasized that women refugees are facing multi-dimensional
                                       problems. The problems include those they are facing as individuals and those which
                                       are actually the problems faced by their husbands, children and parents but are extended
                                       to women refugees because of their role as caregivers. This extension of problems
                                       is the aspect that needs to be considered to a greater degree in identifying the protection
                                       needed by women refugees and making the policies and actions to address them.

                              <p id="d1e312">The effort to focus on women refugees was initiated by “United Nations High Commissioner
                                 for Refugees (UNHCR) Policy on Refugee Women” [<a href="#R33">33</a>]. As mentioned by Buscher [<a href="#R34">34</a>], Director of Protection, Women’s Refugee Commission, the three main objectives from
                                 the document are to provide protection appropriate to this group’s specific needs,
                                 to identify appropriate durable solutions, and to provide assistance which shall encourage
                                 the realization of their full potential and encourage their participation in preparing
                                 for a durable solution.” Another document titled “Guidelines on the Protection of
                                 Refugee Women” [<a href="#R22">22</a>] was also produced in the following year to enhance the efforts to protect women
                                 refugees. The following picture listed the key efforts in protecting women refugees.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e323">An observation of the content of the policies made by UNHCR above shows initiatives
                                 to provide a more detailed identification of women refugees’ classification, conditions,
                                 and needs. the First Policy on Refugee Women [<a href="#R33">33</a>] UNHCR has highlighted the need to acknowledge that being a refugee effects men and
                                 women differently, thus programs designed to address their problems need to take the
                                 differences into consideration. This policy started to use the term “specific needs”
                                 for women refugees and emphasizes the need to ensure that women refugees’ needs are
                                 considered in all stages of planning, management and evaluation of the refugee programs.
                                 The “Guidelines on the Protection of Refugee Women” [<a href="#R22">22</a>] has identified more members of vulnerable groups to include “unaccompanied adolescent
                                 girls and women, elderly women and disabled women” and strongly suggested that a comprehensive
                                 effort to provide protections for women refugees will require active participation
                                 of the women refugees themselves in the planning and implementation of the programs.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e331">In the years following this set of documents, the UNHCR has made various effort to
                                 implement the guidelines through activities such as needs assessment, creating manuals,
                                 and conducting dialogues. As reported in the assessment conducted by the Women’s Refugee
                                 Commission, titled “UNHCR Policy on Refugee Women and Guidelines on Their Protection:
                                 An Assessment of Ten Years of Implementation” [<a href="#R35">35</a>] the efforts have succeeded in creating broad awareness on women refugees’ needs
                                 and interests and bringing improvements towards the provision of assistance for women
                                 refugees. However as observed by Buscher [<a href="#R34">34</a>], in general, the implementation was still “uneven, incomplete, and occurring on
                                 an ad hoc basis”. While acknowledging the success in creating policies, guidelines
                                 and tools to protect women refugees, Buscher argued that it was challenging for the
                                 UNHCR to set the practical measures for implementation. To date, this issue of challenges
                                 in translating policies into implementation measures remains and becomes more urgent
                                 since the issues faced by women refugees in the field become more complex. As also
                                 identified by Buscher, the unpredictable practical measures in the field can hamper
                                 the efforts to produce policies and guidelines [<a href="#R34">34</a>].

                              <p id="d1e352">UNHCR has tried to accommodate this rising complexity in its policies and documents.
                                 In 2003, for example, UNHCR published “Sexual and Gender-Based Violence against Refugees,
                                 Returnees and Internally Displaced Persons: Guidelines for Prevention and Response”
                                 [<a href="#R36">36</a>] which goes into more detail in identifying the needs of women refugees with SGBV
                                 issues and how to respond to those needs. By 2008, UNHCR published the “Handbook for
                                 the Protection of Women and Girls” that focuses on women and girls who are asylum-seekers,
                                 refugees, internally displaced, returnees, stateless or who have integrated into new
                                 communities [<a href="#R29">29</a>]. The highlight of this handbook is its emphasis on the importance of empowerment
                                 of women refugees.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e360">The challenges in implementation are confirmed by the various reports on the conditions
                                 experienced during their journey and in the camps. Even though there are some initiatives
                                 that have been conducted by the European Union in the efforts to assist refugees,
                                 there are still a number of particular needs that are yet to be fulfilled, even the
                                 provision of basic facilities such as secure and separate toilets and bed rooms. According
                                 to a report from the European Parliament, the key findings include the conditions
                                 which make it more difficult for women to obtain asylum status and the reception conditions.
                                 It is also suggested that the housing of asylum seekers should be organized in a gender-sensitive
                                 way, where men and women should live in separate houses (except for families who want
                                 to stay together), because lack of privacy could lead to more violence against women
                                 [<a href="#R37">37</a>]. They also need to have access to private keys to their own rooms to increase security
                                 and prevent theft or sexual abuse. Moreover, private bathing and sanitation facilities,
                                 sufficient health-care and psychological aid for women who have had traumatic experiences
                                 should also be provided in the refugee camps [<a href="#R37">37</a>]. These findings by the European Parliament indicate that there are still a significant
                                 number of protection related problems for women refugees on the ground.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e368">Challenges also relate to the coordination among those involved in the entire effort
                                 of providing for needs and protection for women refugees. As assessed by Carrera et
                                 al [<a href="#R38">38</a>], there is a lack of effective action with regard to sharing protection and human
                                 rights responsibilities among member states of the European Union. The Directive 2013/32/EU
                                 on granting and withdrawing international protection, has stated that all the member
                                 states should “identify vulnerable persons and provide special guarantees for these
                                 persons” [<a href="#R37">37</a>]. Since this concerns people who are on the move, coordination of efforts between
                                 the countries involved becomes more crucial. Unfortunately, to date, the refugee crisis
                                 has led to critical debate on the political agendas among European Union member states.
                                 As argued by Heaven Crawley, Chair in International Migration for the Centre for Trust,
                                 Peace and Social Relations at Coverntry University, in her piece on TheConversation.com
                                 [<a href="#R39">39</a>], for example, the so-called migration crisis has been more about the geopolitics
                                 of the EU, not so much about the movement of people. Based on the research that she
                                 conducted with her team, Crawley argued that:
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e379">
                                 <i>“…the countries of the EU have used the issue of migration to consolidate their own
                                    political power and to challenge others. Fingers are being pointed precisely along
                                    the lines of decades-old geopolitical conflicts between European countries”.</i>
                                 
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e384">If the countries of the EU continue to focus more on their political interests, the
                                 actual needs of the refugees, including those of women, will continue to be neglected.
                                 Thus, more efforts to identify and promote the specific needs of refugees, particularly
                                 those of women, are required.

                              <p id="d1e389">The discussion in this paper has shown growing attention towards the condition and
                                 needs of women refugees and improved responses made at the international, regional
                                 and national level. However, a number of issues remain. First, the speed of the growth
                                 and spread of the issues that need to be addressed on the field is much higher than
                                 the ability to make and implement policies. A closer look at the findings show that
                                 the implemented policies tend to provide generalized assistance which do not consider
                                 the specific needs of women refugees, let alone women refugees with more specific
                                 needs as discussed in this paper. Moreover, while the existing issues are yet to be
                                 addressed comprehensively, more issues continue to arise. Second, the ability to accommodate
                                 all needs comprehensively is limited and is hampered by the lack of coordination among
                                 actors involved. Policies made at international level tend to provide general guidelines,
                                 while in the field, initiatives and actions tend to be less coordinated and conducted
                                 with different standards. Third, in line with the main argument of this paper, when
                                 women refugees are discussed, the issue is that existing policies and initiatives
                                 tend to consider each category of women refugees in isolation, while in reality, women
                                 refugees usually have multiple roles and responsibilities. Instead of looking at them
                                 as pregnant women refugees, or women who have suffered SGBV experience, or women refugees
                                 with disabilities, they should be portrayed as pregnant women who still have to take
                                 care of other children, their husband and the elderly or pregnant women with SGBV
                                 experience who eventually have to deal with their past and the responsibility to take
                                 care of their children. In other words, the classification has to be enriched with
                                 more dimensions and a greater spectrum of types of women refugees.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e391">In creating a greater level of protection for women refugees, greater consideration
                                 must be given to their obligation they have to protect the other refugees for whom
                                 they are morally responsible.
