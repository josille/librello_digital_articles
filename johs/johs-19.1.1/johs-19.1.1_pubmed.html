                  <p class="first" id="d1e58">Over the last five years, violent non-state actors have acquired armed unmanned aerial
                     vehicles (UAVs) and have been using them extensively. This paper presents the main
                     non-state actors involved and the areas in which they have used this tool, as well
                     as how UAVs are used and procured. To date, armed UAVs have mainly been used by non-state
                     actors in the Middle East and Central Asia. They have also been used in the conflict
                     zones of Ukraine, Myanmar, Mexico, and Ecuador. While this is worrisome, limited evidence
                     suggests that violent non-state actors use armed UAVs intentionally in areas where
                     mostly civilians are present. The paper details the state of UAV usage by non-state
                     actors and develops a thesis of cyclic adaptation between state and non-state actors.
                     Not only do non-state actors learn from state actors, so does state and state-backed
                     actors learn from non-state actors in conflict zones.  This process have been visible
                     on the battlefield in Ukraine, where state-backed actors on both sides have incorporated
                     smaller consumer style UAVs into their repertoire. As the use of armed UAVs developed
                     substantially following Hezbollah’s early UAV operations in 2004 and spread to many
                     regions of the world, the adaptation of non-state cleverness and ingenuity can be
                     harnessed by state actors in times of poor or limited access to weaponry and support
                     systems.

               <!-- named anchor --></a><h2 class="main-title">1.- Introduction</h2>
            <p id="d1e75">Nation-states have air superiority over their non-state counterparts, within and outside
               conflict areas. While the difference between the first’s and latter’s air capabilities
               remains substantial, during the last decade, non-state actors have taken advantage
               of the increased availability of consumer-style drones to take some of their fight
               to the skies. Armed unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the hands of state actors have
               long been debated, and there are concerns regarding legal issues, technological constraints,
               and operational efficiency [<a href="#R1">1</a>]. Now, in the hands of non-state actors, armed UAVs have forced security forces to
               also keep a keen eye on the skies while fighting on the ground.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e80">Access to UAVs has raised the concerns of national security professionals about terrorist
               attacks in Western countries and outside of conflict zones [<a href="#R2">2</a>, <a href="#R3">3</a>] and those of intelligence services and security forces [<a href="#R4">4</a>]. One such concern is a number of or, even worse, a swarm of armed UAVs approaching
               a civilian-populated area, targeting them. A swarm of UAVs, as opposed to merely multiple
               UAVs, is defined by their ability to communicate and coordinate their positions and
               actions to accomplish a shared goal [<a href="#R5">5</a>]. To date, no non-state actor has used a UAV swarm to attack civilian or military
               targets. However, a Russian base in Syria was attacked on several occasions by multiple
               armed UAVs. In one incident, up to 13 armed UAVs engaged the Russian base [<a href="#R6">6</a>]. Importantly, no evidence of communication and coordination between the UAVs was
               found.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e97">Another critical scenario is if those UAVs have autonomous capabilities. In the near-future
               short movie ‘‘Slaughterbots,’’ terrifying scenes showed how flying robots autonomously
               select and engage human targets. The movie made the headlines in 2017 and later again
               in 2021. However, those following the UAV and lethal autonomous weapons system (LAWS)
               field were closely aware that something similar had already happened in real life.
               A UN report from 2021 describes an incident from March 2020 in Libya, where a Kargu
               loitering munition UAV apparently identified and engaged a target on its own. If the
               news is factual, this is the first publicly known incident where aerial LAWS acted
               on its own and inflicted potentially lethal violence upon humans [<a href="#R7">7</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e102">The question arises: What if that autonomous UAV was launched by a non-state actor,
               such as a militant or terrorist group, toward a crowded area with civilians gathered?
               It is a terrifying thought with a possibly horrific outcome in terms of human loss.
               This then begs the question: How likely are these scenarios, especially the ones describing
               mass attacks against civilians? The future is unknown, and no crystal ball has been
               invented to foresee it yet. Therefore, our best chance of predicting future developments
               is by looking at what we already know under the current circumstances and applying
               that knowledge to future scenarios. So, what do we know about non-state actors and
               armed UAVs? Who has used them in what region of the world and when and against what
               kinds of targets? Furthermore, how have non-state actors procured armed UAVs?
            </p>
            <p id="d1e104">Past research has focused, among other things, on the technological development of
               UAVs by violent non-state actors [<a href="#R8">8</a>, <a href="#R9">9</a>], tactical use and human harm [<a href="#R10">10</a>, <a href="#R11">11</a>, <a href="#R12">12</a>], UAVs as a means to communicate and present violent non-state actors as sovereign
               legitimate actors [<a href="#R13">13</a>], and on the proliferation of UAVs [<a href="#R14">14</a>]. However, none of these covered or aimed to cover, more broadly, the field of violent
               non-state actors and armed UAVs. Using prior case studies, scholarly writing, and
               reports, this article seeks to summarize and present what we know now (as of late-2022).
               This research is relevant for both civilian governments in or close to areas where
               non-state actors have used armed UAVs to help them plan and maintain contingency plans
               and security policies and prepare themselves and their citizens for the possibility
               of a violent non-state actor’s UAV attack. The research is also relevant for intelligence
               and security services, as it maps out relevant actors and their historical capabilities
               in taking their fights to the skies.

            <p id="d1e131">This article relies on a snowball procedure to identify relevant sources, both academic
               and gray literature, as proposed by Wohlin [<a href="#R15">15</a>]. This approach has, in contrast to a traditional systematic or scoping review, its
               point of departure in several publications on the current topic and not keyword searches
               in academic databases. The reason for having a broader, yet less systematic, approach
               is to capture the wide range of publications from among other NGOs and high-quality
               journalism often left out of rigorous systematic reviews. It also transparently utilizes
               important publications and their references. Moreover, while the database searching
               systematic review approach with its published research protocols and search strings
               is highly valued as a means to synthesize extant research [<a href="#R16">16</a>], few studies have addressed the reliability of systematic literature studies [<a href="#R15">15</a>]. Peer-reviewed academic work is also, in this study, considered a main target for
               snowball searching. However, leaving out reports and publications from research institutions,
               NGOs, and high-quality journalism will leave the study with a less up-to-date overview
               of the UAV field. Inclusion criteria, relating to both academic and non-academic publications,
               are that the publication provides either detail, general insights, or analysis on
               general non-state actors and UAVs, specific non-state actors, or geographical regions
               or issues related to violent non-state actors and UAVs. The publications used as starting
               points in this process are presented in Table <a href="#Tab1">1</a> below.

            <p id="d1e232">This research relies solely on sources in the English language, thereby leaving out
               potential sources in other languages. This limitation has implications for the breadth
               of sources, potentially skewing the focus toward a Western-centric approach. Furthermore,
               the research has a state-centric position, which is in line with traditional terrorism
               and conflict studies traditions. Such a research position often revolves around understanding
               a potential threat from violent non-state actors, the consequences of terror attacks,
               and how nation-states can prepare and respond to such threats [<a href="#R18">18</a>]. While there is increased concern from critical terrorism scholars that this position
               may fail to recognize the potentially normative and state problem-solving consequences
               of its position and methodologies [<a href="#R19">19</a>], such criticism can be found within more traditionally oriented terrorism scholars
               as well [<a href="#R20">20</a>]. The state-centric position, as well as the language, timeframe, and type of publications,

            <p id="d1e251">UAVs, both armed and unarmed, have been a part of Hezbollah’s and Hamas’ repertoire
               for over 15 years [<a href="#R21">21</a>]. Supplied or otherwise supported by Iran, these two non-state actors pioneered what
               we in recent years have seen in Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, and Afghanistan.
               In Iraq and Syria, both the so-called Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) and
               Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) have inflicted attacks on local government and US-led forces
               using locally developed UAVs as well as modified quadcopter UAVs with grenade dropping
               capabilities [<a href="#R22">22</a>, <a href="#R23">23</a>]. In Yemen and Saudi Arabia, the Houthis are fighting both Yemen’s legitimate government
               and a Saudi-led coalition backing them using a vast repertoire of missiles and armed
               UAVs [<a href="#R24">24</a>, <a href="#R25">25</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e268">The Taliban has, like many other non-state actors, used unarmed UAVs to conduct surveillance
               of security forces for at least six years [<a href="#R26">26</a>, <a href="#R27">27</a>]. However, Taliban forces in 2020, while still fighting Afghan security forces and
               international forces, did drop grenades or mortar shells from quadcopter-style UAVs
               on some occasions [<a href="#R28">28</a>]. These attacks resemble how ISIS used armed UAVs in Iraq and Syria in 2016 and 2017.
               The Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) has used armed drones against Turkish forces in
               a similar manner [<a href="#R29">29</a>], and later, the same has been observed by researchers following anti-government
               forces against Myanmar’s military [<a href="#R30">30</a>].

               <!-- named anchor --></a><h2 class="main-title">5.- Where?</h2>
            <p id="d1e288">The examples above are by far gathered mostly from the Middle East (Iraq, Syria, and
               Yemen) and Central Asia (Afghanistan). Armed non-state actors in the Sahel and East
               Africa have also used UAVs for reconnaissance and media purposes, much like similar
               groups in the areas mentioned above. However, UAV attacks conducted by non-state actors
               in the Sahel and East Africa are yet to happen according to open sources [<a href="#R31">31</a>]. In addition to these areas and Myanmar, armed UAVs have, to a lesser extent, been
               used in other regions by non-state actors. In South and North America, armed UAVs
               have been used by criminal cartels in Mexico to attack police forces [<a href="#R32">32</a>], an Ecuadorian prison [<a href="#R33">33</a>], and President Maduro of Venezuela [<a href="#R34">34</a>]. Moreover, a UAV fitted with a copper wire was apparently used to target a US power
               station in Pennsylvania [<a href="#R35">35</a>]. Armed UAVs have also been used by non-state actors on both sides of the conflict
               in Ukraine, whereby armed groups loyal to Ukraine for several years have engaged pro-Russian
               militants [<a href="#R36">36</a>].
            </p>
         </div>
         <div class="section"><a id="s6">
               <!-- named anchor --></a><h2 class="main-title">6.- What?</h2>
            <p id="d1e312">There are two main types of UAVs used by both state and non-state actors: the fixed
               wing UAV with a vertically positioned rotor and the quadcopter-type UAV with four
               or more rotors positioned horizontally [<a href="#R37">37</a>]. The Houthis in Yemen present a good example of dual use, depending on the range
               to target. When the Houthis engage targets inside Saudi Arabia, they appear to mostly
               use fixed-wing UAVs with explosives that either detonate on targets or close to them.
               In combat against government-supported forces in Yemen, examples of both fixed-wing
               UAVs and quadcopter-style UAVs have been found [<a href="#R38">38</a>]. This is similar to how ISIS used armed UAVs in 2016 and 2017, by dropping explosives
               or placing explosives in rigged UAVs on the ground [<a href="#R17">17</a>, <a href="#R39">39</a>, <a href="#R40">40</a>]. The quadcopter-style UAV is also used by groups fighting government forces in Myanmar,
               by the Taliban in 2020, by PKK fighting Turkish forces, and by criminal cartels in
               Mexico and Ecuador, as well as by pro-Russian militia in eastern Ukraine. While the
               fixed-wing UAV in general has a greater range, the quadcopter UAV possesses the characteristic
               advantage of being able to hover over a designated target area [<a href="#R41">41</a>] before dropping grenades or other explosives on its below target.

               <!-- named anchor --></a><h2 class="main-title">7.- When?</h2>
            <p id="d1e336">In terms of when non-state actors have used armed UAVs, with a few exemptions, most
               incidents have occurred from 2016 until the end of 2021. Prior to that, Hezbollah
               was recorded to use them with a few flights into Israel in 2004 [<a href="#R42">42</a>] and attacks in 2006 and 2014 [<a href="#R31">31</a>]. ISIS developed and used its armed UAV program extensively in 2016 and 2017. As
               seen above, ISIS’s creative use of consumer quadcopters modified to drop grenades
               may have inspired the Mexican cartels, Taliban, PKK, and anti-government forces in
               Myanmar to do the same in the following years. Needless to say, UAVs have become more
               easily available, less expensive, and more well-known to the public than they were
               at the onset of Hezbollah’s development of UAVs over 15 years ago.

            <p id="d1e347">The question of how is divided into two sections: one about how non-state actors use
               armed UAVs, such as target selection, and the second about how they procure UAVs to
               the extent that it is known.

                  <!-- named anchor --></a><h3 class="section-title">8.1.- How Armed UAVs are Used by Non-state Actors</h3>
               <p id="d1e352">Armed UAVs have the potential to overwhelm a civilian area, inflict distress, and
                  cause severe injuries [<a href="#R43">43</a>, <a href="#R44">44</a>]. However, research on non-state actors shows that they do not select targets randomly
                  and tend to focus on hard targets, such as armed forces or security forces, rather
                  than soft targets where unprepared civilians are present. They also do not cause mass
                  casualties or mass injuries [<a href="#R10">10</a>], and in a comparison with US UAV attacks, non-state actors’ UAV attacks were found
                  to be less lethal than US UAV attacks, but they caused slightly greater injuries to
                  civilians [<a href="#R12">12</a>]. This finding should however be revised following investigative journalism by the
                  New York Times, which uncovered thousands of civilian deaths from US drone strikes
                  compared to what was formerly known [<a href="#R45">45</a>]. Two separate studies have also examined the extent to which non-state actors use
                  armed UAVs as a tool to conduct strategic bombing according to available data. Both
                  studies failed to find evidence to support this. Rather, non-state actors use armed
                  UAVs tactically against armed forces [<a href="#R10">10</a>, <a href="#R11">11</a>] and for theatrical and media purposes [<a href="#R11">11</a>, <a href="#R13">13</a>]. However, some important exceptions to these patterns are well known, such as the
                  Houthi attacks on Saudi airports [<a href="#R46">46</a>]. Other examples are the UAV attacks against Iraqi Prime Minister al-Kadhimi in late
                  2021 [<a href="#R47">47</a>] or Venezuelan President Maduro in 2018 [<a href="#R34">34</a>].

               <p id="d1e395">Non-state actors procure armed UAVs in different ways. In the case of Hezbollah, which
                  was responsible for pioneering this tool for non-state actors, evidence suggests that
                  support was provided by Iran, as both the Ayoub and Shahed model UAVs were reportedly
                  used by Hezbollah [<a href="#R42">42</a>, <a href="#R48">48</a>, <a href="#R49">49</a>]. Additionally, consumer-grade quadcopter UAVs, such as the DJI Phantom, have also
                  been used by Hezbollah, indicating procurement through commercial channels via third
                  parties [<a href="#R50">50</a>]. Hamas has also used several versions of the Iranian Ababil UAV model, which gave
                  them a platform to conduct reconnaissance and carry out attacks [<a href="#R51">51</a>]. Hamas’ UAV capabilities are also linked to the work of an in-house Tunisian UAV
                  engineer. Since he was killed in a 2016 assassination [<a href="#R52">52</a>], Hamas’ UAVs, such as balloons and kites, have clearly been far less sophisticated
                  [<a href="#R53">53</a>]. Notably, a recent development, albeit beyond the non-state sphere, is that Iran
                  is supplying Russia with various types of armed UAVs that are used in attacks against
                  civilian-populated areas, such as Kyiv in Ukraine [<a href="#R54">54</a>]. While this does not constitute terrorism in the traditional sense, Russia is inflicting
                  fear, uncertainty, and terror upon Ukraine’s civilians as well as harming Ukraine’s
                  energy infrastructure through the use of such UAVs [<a href="#R55">55</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e425">ISIS’s procurement of armed UAVs has been extensively researched by both scholars
                  and journalists [<a href="#R17">17</a>, <a href="#R56">56</a>, <a href="#R57">57</a>]. A Danish investigation effort by a collective of journalists and researchers found
                  that a Danish–Lebanese engineer played a key role in procuring ISIS drone parts through
                  an intricate network spanning from Denmark to Syria [<a href="#R57">57</a>]. However, ISIS also had other supply routes, as there was no overlap between retailers
                  used to buy drones in the case mentioned above and findings from another investigation
                  of ISIS drone procurement [<a href="#R17">17</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e442">In addition to Hezbollah, Hamas, and ISIS, the Houthis in Yemen have frequently used
                  armed UAVs against targets in Yemen and Saudi Arabia [<a href="#R10">10</a>]. Research into Houthi UAVs has found that important components are similar to those
                  used in improvised explosive devices by other non-state actors in Yemen and Bahrain.
                  Others are similar to those in Iranian UAVs [<a href="#R25">25</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e450">After Hezbollah pioneered this field, many others followed suit. ISIS has had a massive
                  influence on the use of commercial-grade UAVs among non-state actors, and their modification
                  of easily obtainable models such as the DJI Phantom has inspired others to mimic their
                  operations. Parallel to ISIS’s loss of land, Mexican cartels started using quadcopter
                  UAVs with explosives, following their example [<a href="#R58">58</a>]. Researchers following Mexican criminal cartels have observed this repeatedly after
                  2017 [<a href="#R32">32</a>, <a href="#R59">59</a>]. The Taliban’s use of armed UAVs is also similar to that of ISIS’s use of quadcopters
                  [<a href="#R28">28</a>]. A similar use can be found among the People’s Defense Force in Myanmar, in combat
                  with the government’s forces [<a href="#R30">30</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e467">Violent non-state actors operating within and outside active conflict zones are typically
                  less technologically sophisticated compared to their government-led counterparts [<a href="#R60">60</a>]. Past research has shown that non-state actors learn from and adopt tools and tactics
                  from their state counterparts and that they evolve and adapt because they believe
                  that something can be gained by the innovation [<a href="#R61">61</a>]. An important development in the use of UAVs in 2022 is how Ukrainian forces, supported
                  financially and logistically by other nations, organizations, and private individuals,
                  have used UAVs in the same manner as non-state actors have been doing in conflict
                  zones. Imagery provided by ISIS, the Houthis, and militants fighting in Myanmar, to
                  name a few, has shown how commercially available quadcopter UAVs are re-designed and
                  fitted with various munitions, such as modified grenades and mortar shells. Images
                  of the same have been coming from the Ukrainian battlefield for several months in
                  2022: a UAV hovering over a Russian armored vehicle and dropping explosives on the
                  target [<a href="#R62">62</a>]. In the summer of 2022, these images also featured larger UAVs, such as the DJI
                  Matrice, dropping up to eight explosives on their target below.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e478">Armed UAVs are, as this paper has shown, not only being used in the Middle East but
                  also in South and North America, Central Asia, and South East Asia. This development—now
                  going from non-state actors to state actors—indicates a cyclic adaptation of new tools
                  and tactics. In this cyclic adaptation, both actors appear open to the idea of incorporating
                  the success of their counterparts’ trials and errors. This may be particularly relevant
                  in conflict zones where state actors, much like non-state actors, may struggle at
                  times with gaining access to their preferred weaponry and support systems for military
                  operations. Their counterparts’ ability to adapt and their overall creativity and
                  cleverness may therefore be harnessed if propaganda videos are actively gathered and
                  researched by intelligence and research communities.

               <!-- named anchor --></a><h2 class="main-title">9.- What Does All this Tell us About Future UAV Threats from Non-state Actors?</h2>
            <p id="d1e483">The previous sections inform us of the following: Armed UAVs are mostly used in the
               Middle East and Central Asia by violent non-state actors engaged in conflict zones.
               Non-state actors mainly targeted government security forces or their international
               allies, with some exceptions. Given the development until now, this is likely to continue
               to some degree. However, as the modification of commercially available UAVs continues
               in Mexico, Ecuador, Afghanistan, Yemen, and Myanmar following ISIS’s example from
               2016 and 2017, such inspiration and transfer of tools and tactics are also likely
               to continue. This spread may exponentially increase the risk of non-state actors or
               lone actors using armed UAVs against civilians.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e485">As Iran is identified as a provider and supporter of the Houthis in Yemen—often through
               shipments [<a href="#R63">63</a>]–continued control of naval traffic in the region is of great importance. Further,
               as commercially available quadcopters are and will continue to be accessible in the
               open market, their role in the actions of more non-state actors will most likely become
               greater than what it is currently. In line with the development of 3D-printed gun
               or gun parts [<a href="#R64">64</a>], it is also possible that 3D printing will be used more extensively to produce parts
               essential to modifying off-the-shelf commercial quadcopters with mechanisms to drop
               or place explosives on targets. In addition to UAV parts, such as the UAV’s body,
               rotors, or release mechanisms, 3D-printed weapons can also be fitted onto a UAV. In
               the early days of 3D-printed guns, they were assessed and discussed as unreliable
               [<a href="#R64">64</a>]. However, 3D-printed guns have evolved, and more reliable, fully homemade, semi-automatic
               rifles are now well known [<a href="#R65">65</a>]. There is no reason to believe that the future will not see a merger of partially
               modified UAVs and partially or fully homemade 3D-printed weapons fitted onto them.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e499">These potential developments, possibly advanced locally developed or modified UAVs,
               are worrisome. Considering the potential of autonomous capabilities, the possible
               scenarios appear even worse. Fortunately, to date, there is no indication of non-state
               actors having launched UAVs with autonomous capabilities. However, artificial intelligence
               (AI) is no longer an exclusive resource for nation-states. It is less expensive and
               more available than it was merely a few years ago [<a href="#R66">66</a>]. Like commercial UAVs and 3D printing, it is likely that AI will assist non-state
               actors in future actions. However, at present, if lethal autonomous weapon systems
               are launched and used, a nation-state is likelier responsible. As disturbing as that
               is, it is slightly more encouraging as a nation-state has to answer for their actions
               to a larger extent than a non-state actor and may be subjected to sanctions from the
               international community.

               <!-- named anchor --></a><h2 class="main-title">10.- Concluding Remarks</h2>
            <p id="d1e507">This research utilized a snowballing procedure to identify relevant academic and non-academic
               literature on non-state actors and armed UAVs. In doing so, it has a state-centric
               position, aimed at establishing an overview of the presence and threat of armed UAVs
               in non-state actors’ hands. Over 15 years ago, Hezbollah pioneered non-state actors’
               use of UAVs and armed UAVs. Recent years have shown that many and vastly different
               non-state actors have adopted the ‘‘ISIS version’’ of modified armed commercial UAVs.
               As the use of armed UAVs spreads through social media in particular [<a href="#R67">67</a>, <a href="#R68">68</a>], it is likely that the spread of technology and know-how will continue. This may
               inspire new and emerging players in the field to adopt armed UAVs in their repertoire.
               As recommended in past scholarly work [<a href="#R69">69</a>], intelligence and security services should pay attention to violent non-state actors
               showing interest in and procurement of UAV parts or bodies, particularly those who
               have members with aviation and/or engineering expertise. Research and reporting on
               violent non-state actors’ use of armed UAVs from the last decade have shown that the
               development, to some extent, has come full circle in the sense that state actors or
               state-backed actors are using commercial UAVs in the same manner as violent non-state
               actors have been for several years. Presently and to the best of the authors’ knowledge,
               this can be seen in the Ukrainian forces. However, with trade agreements and sanctions
               limiting the sale of more advanced UAVs to some states, commercial tools developed
               by non-state actors may also be more broadly used by other state actors in the future.
