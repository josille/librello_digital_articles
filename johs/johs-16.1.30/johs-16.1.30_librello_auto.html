                                 of the region. Historically, the region’s significance had been defined by national
                                 security concerns, but the emerging concept of human security has come to provide
                                 a useful framework through which to define and demonstrate the nexus between the two.
                                 This paper provides an overview of the relationship between national and human security
                                 and the concerns shared by individuals working in both areas, with a more narrowed

                              <p id="d1e90">Since satellite observation began in 1979, the Arctic has experienced ever-diminishing
                                 volumes of summer ice, with 2018 being younger and thinner than previous years [<a href="#R1">1</a>]. From that development alone, numerous implications have been examined for the opening
                                 of the Arctic region, many stemming from increases in maritime access to Arctic waters
                                 [<a href="#R2">2</a>]. For those implications raised with the opening of the Arctic, numerous issues are
                                 presented regarding Arctic shipping routes, the economic benefits of transporting
                                 goods through the region, and its geostrategic importance as a power projection platform
                                 for military forces [<a href="#R3">3</a>, <a href="#R4">4</a>, <a href="#R5">5</a>]. Others note the opening of the Arctic and the dash for resources to underscore
                                 the potential effects of competition and confrontation with other nations, including
                                 Russia [<a href="#R6">6</a>] and China [<a href="#R7">7</a>, <a href="#R8">8</a>].
                                 
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e117">Historically, national-security challenges involving the U.S. Arctic have been framed
                                 by the Cold War and the need to provide for the early warning and detection of Soviet
                                 bombers and, later, ballistic missiles. Previously, Alaska played a major role during
                                 WWII, as the Japanese invasion of a U.S. territory sparked unprecedented national
                                 security inertia and ignited a regional military buildup that changed both the demographics
                                 and future of Alaska [<a href="#R9">9</a>]. Various strategic qualities today continue to demonstrate Alaska’s geostrategic
                                 importance to national security [<a href="#R10">10</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e125">Since the ’90s, the concept of human security has continued to become an established
                                 approach centered on a distinct differentiation from the traditional military-state
                                 context of national security. The United Nations has led the way in developing a purpose
                                 for the distinction in “a powerful approach” as a “proven analytical and planning
                                 framework that supports more comprehensive and preventive responses” [<a href="#R11">11</a>]. In the U.S. Arctic, Alaska continues to have a unique relationship with human security,
                                 including challenges resulting from climate change, social pathologies, and disasters
                                 that differ greatly than those experienced in the lower 48 states. While Alaska has
                                 fewer than a million people, the original population consisted of Native peoples who
                                 have lived in the state for thousands of years. Today, the population is an amalgamation
                                 of these Native peoples and other Alaska state residents, who co-depend on a safe
                                 and stable security environment in which to live.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e130">Numerous studies and definitions regarding national security exist, with continued
                                 strides in human security scholarship, research and analysis being made every day.
                                 Less common is scholarship that combines both, possibly due to the relative newness
                                 of human security as an accepted security concept and the complexities involved in
                                 developing an effective framework that integrates the two concepts. To that end, this
                                 article offers an example based upon observable connections between national and human
                                 security under the driving influences of both food and energy security within the
                                 U.S. Arctic.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e132">National security priorities in the U.S. Arctic have often overshadowed human security
                                 as a security concept, challenging access to and the sustainability of food and energy
                                 security requirements. History reminds us that insufficient quantities and types of
                                 food often lead to food insecurity, malnutrition, civil unrest, or even violence.
                                 To date, most studies involving food security have focused on three primary discourses:
                                 access to local foods, Native Alaskan issues, and economic factors [<a href="#R12">12</a>]. In the North, energy can be just as crucial for survival. Oil and the resulting
                                 petroleum investments and revenue serve as the main revenue source for the state of
                                 Alaska [<a href="#R13">13</a>]. Oil also remains the primary source of energy for smaller rural areas, which depend
                                 on diesel electric power [<a href="#R14">14</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e143">The research goal is to illustrate a nexus between national and human security within
                                 the context of a changing U.S. Arctic. In particular, this study examines the roles
                                 of energy and food security within the U.S. region of Alaska, with a more narrowed
                                 examination of the shared energy and food security complexities which overlap the
                                 two central security categories. Consequently, the authors offer a view to understanding
                                 how the distinctions, connections, and overlap made between both national and human
                                 security provide significant insight concerning the northern-related security composition
                                 of the person, the natural world, and the social-civic construct.

                                       of the national security interests of the U.S. throughout the nation’s history [<a href="#R15">15</a>]. The meaning of national security has continued to expand, contract, and morph across
                                       the past several administrations due in large part to changes in focus influenced
                                       by both national and international events of significance [<a href="#R13">13</a>]. Following the aforementioned literature, we utilize a definition of national security
                                       from a broader context involving not only a state-centric perspective and its application
                                       to safeguarding the nation, its people, and their culture but likewise the integration
                                       of human security as a noted requisite to address non-traditional security threats
                                       [<a href="#R16">16</a>]. Although scholars widely recognize the need to integrate human and national security
                                       as a model for international use, Cosby [<a href="#R17">17</a>], supporting a broader definition, underscores the need for the integration of human
                                       security as a basis for U.S. National Security development and the conduct of foreign
                                       policy.

                                       required a steady and ever-increasing multilevel government and interagency approach

                                       largely been differentiated from national and military security in stressing that
                                       individuals as stakeholders are the key focus rather than the state [<a href="#R13">13</a>]. Often, definitions revolve around the need to protect individuals and provide for
                                       principles such as freedom, dignity, and/or livelihood. Others focus on protecting

                                       of the past. The extension of these concerns has been demonstrated in the U.S. military’s
                                       increased involvement in non-warfighting operations, such as humanitarian assistance

                                    <p id="d1e231">According to the U.K. Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs, “a country
                                       and people are food secure when their food systems operate efficiently in such a way
                                       as to remove fear that there will not be enough to eat” [<a href="#R27">27</a>]. At the international level, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United
                                       Nations considers food security a success “when all people, at all times, have physical
                                       and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary
                                       needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life” [<a href="#R28">28</a>]. In a broader sense, food security can effectively be considered on four levels:
                                       (a) individual/household, (b) regional, (c) national, and (d) global. Within each
                                       level, seven key themes help provide even more in-depth measurement of food security
                                       through availability: access, affordability, nutrition and quality, safety, resilience,
                                       and confidence [<a href="#R27">27</a>]. Although such definitions provide some meaning, difficulties do exist as food-security
                                       metrics might not reflect the problems involving static information, which could impact
                                       the flexibility needed to proactively respond to dynamic regional realities [<a href="#R29">29</a>]. Such problems could be the case for the North, especially as the U.S. Arctic continues
                                       to experience significant environmental and socio-economic change, where policy and
                                       operations will need to consider the looming impacts of food security at the local,
                                       state, and regional levels.

                                       of energy sources at an affordable price. Energy security has many aspects. On the
                                       one hand, long-term energy security mainly deals with timely investments to supply
                                       energy in line with economic developments and environmental needs. On the other hand,
                                       short-term energy security focuses on the ability of the energy system to react promptly
                                       to sudden changes in the supply–demand balance [<a href="#R30">30</a>].

                                       include (a) availability, (b) affordability, and (c) acceptability; Hughes [<a href="#R31">31</a>] added a fourth dimension (accessibility). An additional issue related to energy
                                       security that will be incorporated into the above is energy independence. Greene examines
                                       oil independence, [<a href="#R32">32</a>] noting that, should oil remain a dominant energy source in the near future, oil
                                       dependence will continue to be an economic threat in numerous scenarios. He also outlines
                                       in his analysis that the U.S. can achieve oil independence through a combined effort
                                       to reduce consumption while increasing its oil supply.

                                       the indigenous communities, urban-area populations, and industries that support it
                                       [<a href="#R33">33</a>]. According to the Alaska Resource Development Council, seafood harvests in Alaska
                                       for 2018 accounted for more than 60% of the total U.S. fishing harvest, with an economic

                                       within the Arctic marine food web could be altered soon because of climate change.
                                       These changes could affect the migration patterns of fish, with potentially adverse
                                       impacts on marine mammals, and, thus, traditional hunting for indigenous coastal communities

                                    <p id="d1e278">Another notable consideration to the issue of food security is the conduct of illegal,
                                       unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing [<a href="#R36">36</a>]. In the U.S. Arctic today, the consistent security challenge has largely involved
                                       the conflicting fishing activity of various nations, especially Southeast Asia. IUU
                                       fishing and China is an illustrative example. With the world’s largest population,
                                       China’s demand for fish is significant and steady, with supplies unable to be satisfied
                                       by resources located in its own coastal waters, driving activity abroad to meet economic
                                       and food security needs [<a href="#R37">37</a>]. In response to depletion near inland shores, China has increased subsidies to fishing
                                       industries to build larger vessels with increased range, resulting in broader security-related
                                       issues beyond near-coastal fishing [<a href="#R38">38</a>]. Furthermore, China’s Beidou navigation satellite system offers the capability to
                                       transmit short messages or track other units that could be used to coordinate fishing
                                       as well as “maritime reconnaissance” [<a href="#R39">39</a>]. The capability of transiting greater distances with substantially more vessels
                                       has continued to pose a threat to U.S. national security in the Arctic, especially
                                       when enforcement authorities lack the ability to monitor illicit activity. Moreover,
                                       China has consistently demonstrated a willingness to traverse sovereign boundaries

                                       not to associate the State with sanctioned criminal activity but to illustrate a web
                                       of the documented complexities often involving several other actors. Although Chinese
                                       sub-state actors represent the primary violators, the China government overtly supports

                                       exportation. The state has in the past been the anchor for U.S. petroleum production
                                       and has contributed significantly to the industry since the late 1960s, when oil was
                                       discovered in quantities significant enough for large-scale production. While continued
                                       development has helped ensure U.S. energy independence and dominance [<a href="#R43">43</a>, <a href="#R44">44</a>], within the larger context of the Arctic, the development of gas and oil is of great
                                       interest to numerous countries [<a href="#R45">45</a>, <a href="#R46">46</a>].

                                       through diversification and affordable sources [<a href="#R44">44</a>]. In support of that goal, the U.S. finally became an energy net exporter for the
                                       first time in 75 years [<a href="#R47">47</a>, <a href="#R48">48</a>]. However, the extent to which U.S. net exportation is sustainable depends on many
                                       factors, including Alaska’s contribution to oil and gas. Future production in Alaska
                                       partially relies on access to new reserves, including on- and offshore sources. Recent
                                       passage of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act required the Secretary of the Interior to establish
                                       and administer a competitive oil and gas program from the coastal plain (section 1002)

                                       [<a href="#R49">49</a>]. ANWR commenced in 2018 with lease sales, which marked the beginning stages of resource
                                       exploitation [<a href="#R50">50</a>]; in addition, extraction through shale has further supported the National Security

                                       production and 6.8 billion barrels of oil from 2031 to 2050 [<a href="#R48">48</a>].

                                       U.S. energy security. However, recovering natural gas in the North has proven difficult,
                                       as limited transportation resources and associated costs of extraction challenge the
                                       drilling companies’ ability to access resources [<a href="#R54">54</a>]. Moreover, market prices and liquified natural gas ([LNG] which helps boost resource
                                       value) technicalities further complicate the appeal of natural gas production. Alaska
                                       is not new to natural gas, though. Cook Inlet basin still represents the nation’s
                                       oldest natural gas production site since export began in 1967 [<a href="#R55">55</a>]. Notably, operations and transport of natural gas from Cook Inlet are relatively
                                       cheap compared to LNG development originating from the North Slope of Alaska. During

                                             waters have played an important role in food security for many populations since WWII.

                                             is unregulated and unrestricted fishing, which has led to a collapse of the “Donut
                                             Hole” located in the Aleutian Basin of the Bering Sea (Figure <a href="#Fig1">1</a>). As a once healthy and thriving fisheries region, known for its productivity of
                                             pollock, it drew the attention of numerous international fishing fleets from nations,
                                             including the People’s Republic of China, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Poland
                                             [<a href="#R53">53</a>]. The Donut Hole, as Balton outlines, is the result of the extension of the fishery
                                             zones from both the United States and the former Soviet Union. The area inside of

                                             War II as an important food source for a Japan that was facing not only “malnutrition”
                                             but also “social unrest resulting from food shortages” [<a href="#R58">58</a>]. As Japan developed and modernized its fishing fleet and adapted its wartime radar
                                             technology (fish finding), so too did others in the region, including the Republic
                                             of Korea and the USSR. Bailey [<a href="#R59">59</a>] escribes that, initially, interest in foreign fishing fleets in the Bering were
                                             of little interest, until concern developed in the 1960s that the scope of these operations
                                             was beginning to impact the halibut and crab populations, as well as the salmon headed
                                             back to spawn in Alaska. In 1976, the United States would take a more assertive role
                                             to influence fishing practices of these fleets and prioritize domestic fisherman when
                                             it unilaterally extended the Fisheries Conservation Zone (FCZ) out to 200 miles [<a href="#R60">60</a>].

                                             Reported pollock catches from the Donut Hole were at 360,000 tons in 1985, with the
                                             total reported catch coming in at 1.5 million tons by 1989. Although interest existed
                                             to examine the negative impacts, by this point, it was already too late. Three years
                                             later, reported catches in the area amounted to approximately 10,000, signaling a
                                             complete collapse of pollock within the area. Ultimately, a moratorium was achieved
                                             internationally, with an agreement being signed in 1994, the Convention on the Conservation

                                             States, does not maintain a balance between locally produced, imported, and exported
                                             foods [<a href="#R61">61</a>]. Aside from shorter growing seasons and cold-temperature issues, several other categories
                                             of factors explain various agricultural challenges in Alaska, including environmental,
                                             geophysical, biological, and socioeconomic difficulties [<a href="#R62">62</a>]. Of all the food consumed by Alaskans, only 5 to 10% is produced in the state [<a href="#R58">58</a>, <a href="#R63">63</a>]. Additionally, as roughly 10% of a family’s income is dedicated to food in the lower
                                             48, 14% is the norm for a family in Alaska [<a href="#R64">64</a>]. The more distant one is from an urban area in Alaska, the greater the cost of food,
                                             with milk costing $15 a gallon in the community of Kotzebue [<a href="#R65">65</a>]. Importantly, Kotzebue’s study notes that a high cost does not equate to quality
                                             but rather reflects the economic cost of distribution to the far end of the supply
                                             chain which is largely shouldered by the consumer. Consequently, access, costs, and
                                             potential disruption to the supply chain become dynamic contributors to food insecurity.
                                             Fairbanks, the second-most densely populated city, sits 180 miles south of the Arctic
                                             Circle. As the second largest city, it is estimated to maintain a 3- to 5-day food
                                             supply in local stores, compared to Anchorage, which has a 5- to 7-day supply [<a href="#R66">66</a>]. There is also a distinct imbalance between Alaska rural and urban food sources
                                             and consumption. For example, wild food harvest [<a href="#R67">67</a>] for 2017 in rural areas averaged 276 pounds per person, while urban harvest accounted
                                             for 19 pounds per person on average [<a href="#R68">68</a>] underscoring the reliance on locally procured food in rural areas versus the store
                                             bought food in the urban.

                                       of homes in places like Fairbanks were not suitable for the subarctic climate, largely
                                       because builders were from the lower 48 states and were not familiar with the environmental
                                       conditions [<a href="#R69">69</a>]. Consequently, energy costs for households in the high latitudes remain higher due
                                       to their heavy reliance on oil to heat their homes in the winter. Alaska’s harsh winters,
                                       energy-intensive oil and natural gas industries, and small population, place the state’s
                                       per capita energy consumption as third highest in the nation, after Louisiana and
                                       Wyoming [<a href="#R14">14</a>]. Alaska’s unique power grid connects to Anchorage, Fairbanks, and the Kenai Peninsula,
                                       or what is commonly called the “Rail Belt” [<a href="#R70">70</a>]. Microgrids constitute the remainder of electrical grids in smaller towns and villages

                                       consider legislation and sometimes even disaster declarations to supplement and fund
                                       the annual funding of the Power Cost Equalization Program [<a href="#R72">72</a>]. Efforts also include opportunities to transition from fossil fuels. In 2010, Alaska’s
                                       legislature established the Alaska State Energy Policy, which set a goal for Alaska

                                       to 50% by 2025 [<a href="#R14">14</a>]. Hossain, Loring, &amp; Marsik, [<a href="#R26">26</a>] argue that rural Alaska should “have reliable access to socially acceptable energy
                                       generation or provisioning services, at a level sufficient to conducting a sustainable

                                       oil tax regime, energy security for Alaska has been less than nominal, especially
                                       since the 2008 global fiscal crisis. Moreover, rural Alaska’s dependence on fuel oil
                                       remains vulnerable to problems, some of which involve national and human security.
                                       For example, in the fall of 2011, Nome Alaska experienced a severe storm that prevented
                                       the annual scheduled delivery of fuel to the community. Estimates of increased fuel
                                       prices ranged from $5.40 to $9 per gallon if brought in by plane. In the end, the
                                       solution involved a Russian ice-hardened tanker escorted by a USCG ice breaker to
                                       deliver vital fuel in January 2012—in mid-Winter—with reserves running low [<a href="#R73">73</a>].

                                       industry supports the nation’s $6 billion seafood industry [<a href="#R74">74</a>] and subsequently contributes to not only U.S. but global food security. Alaska led
                                       all states in volume, with landings of 60 billion pounds with a value of $1.8 billion,
                                       as well as 158 processing plants and wholesalers and nearly ten people employed [<a href="#R75">75</a>]. According to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, [<a href="#R68">68</a>] fish directly accounted for nearly 54% of wild food harvest in rural Alaskan areas
                                       while providing about 14% of caloric needs and 95% of protein needs in 2017 (Figure
                                       <a href="#Fig3">3</a>). Indirectly, the same report indicates other food sources that are dependent on
                                       fish (land mammals) and/or impacted by illicit fishing practices (marine mammals).

                                       and local levels but for different reasons. Conversely, from a human security perspective,
                                       indigenous and rural communities throughout the U.S. Arctic remain affected by several
                                       factors, including changing food availability and vulnerability, as well as limited
                                       transportation infrastructure. Caulfield [<a href="#R76">76</a>] underscores that, for smaller and indigenous communities, the problems are even
                                       more manifest because they are impacted by the availability of essentials, fluctuations
                                       in pricing, and a long and often costly distribution process. For many of these communities,
                                       subsistence hunting and fishing are important in both a literal (survival) and cultural
                                       food security context. The use of cash or bartering in Alaska often buys necessities,
                                       such as snowmobiles, fuel, food, and ammunition [<a href="#R77">77</a>]. Moreover, higher prices (e.g., for food and energy) require people to work multiple
                                       jobs, which in turn limits time for subsistence hunting and fishing, thus adding to
                                       food insecurity. Importantly, food security through availability and access, coupled
                                       with subsistence hunting and fishing, plays a critical role in the health security
                                       in rural communities [<a href="#R78">78</a>]. In general, an estimated 65% of Alaska residents utilize some form of subsistence

                                       health, and environmental security but also presents opportunities. Gjørv <i>et al.</i> [<a href="#R80">80</a>] states, “Security in the Arctic has focused on issues of power, resource exploitation,
                                       and territory these issues continue to influence government policy. While the idea
                                       of energy security persists with governments to secure energy resources, often power
                                       is exerted over those who are dependent on those untouched resources” [<a href="#R80">80</a>].

                                       of exportation, which does nothing for communities directly, but could offer indirect
                                       benefits as revenues are collected. However, several obstacles prevent the full use

                              <p id="d1e597">The nexus of both human and national security interests within the U.S. Arctic is
                                 remarkable considering the recognized challenges regarding security in the larger
                                 Arctic setting. The relationship and overlap between human and national security interests
                                 within the U.S. Arctic increasingly demonstrate a strong connection to changing dynamics
                                 of the region and how those changes not only serve as an example to the overlapping
                                 nature of the national and human security, but how this region will continue to serve
                                 as a benchmark in exposing those concerns. While, globally, it is increasingly recognized
                                 that human security concerns are becoming more pronounced as international conflict
                                 between nation states declines [<a href="#R23">23</a>], Alaska remains of significant geostrategic importance to U.S. due to national security
                                 interests and its location [<a href="#R10">10</a>].

                              <p id="d1e605">Human security concerns within the U.S. Arctic are likewise both complex and prominent.
                                 As a land of extremes, Alaska will remain as long as people continue to live in an
                                 environment rife with challenges such as isolation and climate, yet rich in remarkable
                                 beauty, resources, and cultural roots and strengths. While external global threats
                                 might not loom large for individuals within the region [<a href="#R24">24</a>], the changing climate is altering the physical landscape in relation to permafrost
                                 and, as a consequence, the longer term viability of Arctic infrastructure and its
                                 residents way of life. To drill down into the human security aspects of the U.S. Arctic,
                                 climate change has altered the physical landscape such that indigenous peoples of
                                 the U.S. Arctic are finding it difficult to “put food on the table” [<a href="#R83">83</a>]. Still, as a state on the front lines of climate change, its efforts in proactive
                                 adaptation planning will serve to potentially reduce not only the costs but the impacts
                                 of a changing climate [<a href="#R84">84</a>].

                                          requirements of the U. S. is both very real and significant. In historical and contemporary
                                          contexts, Alaska has significantly contributed to and enabled the nation to achieve
                                          both energy dominance and independence [<a href="#R85">85</a>]. Vast oil and natural gas estimates indicate the presence of other production areas,
                                          such as the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas which could prove to further reinforce energy

                                          of a $6 billion U.S. parent industry. Nationally, Dutch Harbor has led the nation
                                          with the highest amount of seafood landed for more than two decades, with approximately
                                          770 million pounds alone in 2017 [<a href="#R75">75</a>]. Likewise, as the report highlights, this industry provides approximately 15% of
                                          rural Alaskans’ employment, with an extended national impact of creating 99,000 full-time
                                          equivalent jobs. The perspectives drawn from this evidence illustrate how the economics
                                          of fisheries relate to both the national security significance of a food rich region,
                                          but further underscore how seafood contributes to the economic basis of human security
                                          at a more localized level. Current impacts to fisheries from illicit activity continue
                                          to represent issues closely associated with national security, with the potential
                                          to escalate into higher tension or conflict. However, as previously developed, the
                                          region is not on the cusp of conflict as diplomatic intervention has proven itself
                                          effective in negotiated agreements to safeguard valuable fishing areas.

                                          are sizeable and are at odds with sustainability and other initiatives related to
                                          longer term climate-change adaptation. At the same time, the traditional need for
                                          energy is real, particularly considering the backdrop of Alaska’s cold winters and
                                          ensuing energy consumption rates as compared to the Lower 48. Beyond the simple need
                                          to meet the energy demands of Alaska through the use of home heating oil and natural
                                          gas, the state’s economy depends greatly on the production of these resources for
                                          its revenue and longer term financial viability. This unique juxtaposition leaves
                                          Alaska at odds with itself. Although the state contributes to the energy and human
                                          security needs of those who live and work there, revenue, resulting from the royalties
                                          realized from the sovereign wealth fund represent the largest contribution toward
                                          investment, and thus, returns (currently Alaska’s largest revenue source)—which comes
                                          at a time when climate change and environmental issues have become more contentious.

                                          other areas of shared concern are worthy of analysis, including the economic, environmental,
                                          and health security challenges of the region. While certain aspects of this paper
                                          have touched on each of these areas, the U.S. Arctic as a sub-region is very different
                                          from other parts of the Arctic, and especially the contiguous United States. The needs
                                          of the individual intersect with those of the region, or the state, on important topics
                                          including subsistence hunting, home heating, and the effects of climate change. A
                                          similar, broader concern is also observed in addressing the health security needs
                                          of the U.S. Arctic during an economic downturn. This concern in itself has the potential
                                          to undermine the national as well as human security stability in a region that is
                                          on the front lines of climate security concerns while great power competition continues
                                          to entrench itself throughout the Circumpolar North.

                                          communities, overfishing of the region has indeed had a longer term impact, as fishing
                                          harvests for a variety of has species have declined appreciably [<a href="#R58">58</a>]. From this loss, however, the “Doughnut Hole Convention” was developed and has global
