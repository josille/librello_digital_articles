                  <p class="first" id="d1e81">Changes in the U.S. Arctic are challenging both the national and human security dynamics
                     of the region. Historically, the region’s significance had been defined by national
                     security concerns, but the emerging concept of human security has come to provide
                     a useful framework through which to define and demonstrate the nexus between the two.
                     This paper provides an overview of the relationship between national and human security
                     and the concerns shared by individuals working in both areas, with a more narrowed
                     focus on the interrelated issues of both food and energy security within the U.S.
                     Arctic. Considering the substantial overlap of aspects of food and energy on both
                     national as well as human security, an analysis of the relationships involving each
                     provides meaningful and extended context of the term “security” for the Arctic region.

            <p id="d1e90">Since satellite observation began in 1979, the Arctic has experienced ever-diminishing
               volumes of summer ice, with 2018 being younger and thinner than previous years [<a href="#R1">1</a>]. From that development alone, numerous implications have been examined for the opening
               of the Arctic region, many stemming from increases in maritime access to Arctic waters
               [<a href="#R2">2</a>]. For those implications raised with the opening of the Arctic, numerous issues are
               presented regarding Arctic shipping routes, the economic benefits of transporting
               goods through the region, and its geostrategic importance as a power projection platform
               for military forces [<a href="#R3">3</a>, <a href="#R4">4</a>, <a href="#R5">5</a>]. Others note the opening of the Arctic and the dash for resources to underscore
               the potential effects of competition and confrontation with other nations, including
               Russia [<a href="#R6">6</a>] and China [<a href="#R7">7</a>, <a href="#R8">8</a>].
               
            </p>
            <p id="d1e117">Historically, national-security challenges involving the U.S. Arctic have been framed
               by the Cold War and the need to provide for the early warning and detection of Soviet
               bombers and, later, ballistic missiles. Previously, Alaska played a major role during
               WWII, as the Japanese invasion of a U.S. territory sparked unprecedented national
               security inertia and ignited a regional military buildup that changed both the demographics
               and future of Alaska [<a href="#R9">9</a>]. Various strategic qualities today continue to demonstrate Alaska’s geostrategic
               importance to national security [<a href="#R10">10</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e125">Since the ’90s, the concept of human security has continued to become an established
               approach centered on a distinct differentiation from the traditional military-state
               context of national security. The United Nations has led the way in developing a purpose
               for the distinction in “a powerful approach” as a “proven analytical and planning
               framework that supports more comprehensive and preventive responses” [<a href="#R11">11</a>]. In the U.S. Arctic, Alaska continues to have a unique relationship with human security,
               including challenges resulting from climate change, social pathologies, and disasters
               that differ greatly than those experienced in the lower 48 states. While Alaska has
               fewer than a million people, the original population consisted of Native peoples who
               have lived in the state for thousands of years. Today, the population is an amalgamation
               of these Native peoples and other Alaska state residents, who co-depend on a safe
               and stable security environment in which to live.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e130">Numerous studies and definitions regarding national security exist, with continued
               strides in human security scholarship, research and analysis being made every day.
               Less common is scholarship that combines both, possibly due to the relative newness
               of human security as an accepted security concept and the complexities involved in
               developing an effective framework that integrates the two concepts. To that end, this
               article offers an example based upon observable connections between national and human
               security under the driving influences of both food and energy security within the
               U.S. Arctic.
            </p>
            <p id="d1e132">National security priorities in the U.S. Arctic have often overshadowed human security
               as a security concept, challenging access to and the sustainability of food and energy
               security requirements. History reminds us that insufficient quantities and types of
               food often lead to food insecurity, malnutrition, civil unrest, or even violence.
               To date, most studies involving food security have focused on three primary discourses:
               access to local foods, Native Alaskan issues, and economic factors [<a href="#R12">12</a>]. In the North, energy can be just as crucial for survival. Oil and the resulting
               petroleum investments and revenue serve as the main revenue source for the state of
               Alaska [<a href="#R13">13</a>]. Oil also remains the primary source of energy for smaller rural areas, which depend
               on diesel electric power [<a href="#R14">14</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e143">The research goal is to illustrate a nexus between national and human security within
               the context of a changing U.S. Arctic. In particular, this study examines the roles
               of energy and food security within the U.S. region of Alaska, with a more narrowed
               examination of the shared energy and food security complexities which overlap the
               two central security categories. Consequently, the authors offer a view to understanding
               how the distinctions, connections, and overlap made between both national and human
               security provide significant insight concerning the northern-related security composition
               of the person, the natural world, and the social-civic construct.

               <p id="d1e151">Defining “national security” remains somewhat problematic due to the changing nature
                  of the national security interests of the U.S. throughout the nation’s history [<a href="#R15">15</a>]. The meaning of national security has continued to expand, contract, and morph across
                  the past several administrations due in large part to changes in focus influenced
                  by both national and international events of significance [<a href="#R13">13</a>]. Following the aforementioned literature, we utilize a definition of national security
                  from a broader context involving not only a state-centric perspective and its application
                  to safeguarding the nation, its people, and their culture but likewise the integration
                  of human security as a noted requisite to address non-traditional security threats
                  [<a href="#R16">16</a>]. Although scholars widely recognize the need to integrate human and national security
                  as a model for international use, Cosby [<a href="#R17">17</a>], supporting a broader definition, underscores the need for the integration of human
                  security as a basis for U.S. National Security development and the conduct of foreign
                  policy.

               <p id="d1e165">This article subscribes to the classification of the Arctic from the <i>U.N. Arctic Human Development Report</i>, which includes the entirety of the state of Alaska [<a href="#R18">18</a>]. Since the attack on Pearl Harbor and the subsequent invasion that materialized
                  during the Aleutian Campaign of World War II, Alaska’s role in national security has
                  required a steady and ever-increasing multilevel government and interagency approach
                  to provide for U.S. national security concerns [<a href="#R10">10</a>]. Today, Alaska continues to serve at the forefront of U.S. national security through
                  significant national defense responsibilities as a primary location for critical missile
                  defense infrastructure, including both the ground-based interceptors located at Fort
                  Greely and the Long-Range Discrimination Rader at Clear Air Station [<a href="#R19">19</a>]. Furthermore, the U.S. Coast Guard, as an organization subordinate to the Department
                  of Homeland Security, continues to provide primary operational surface capabilities
                  for the U.S. Arctic maritime environment as well as the mission to conduct international
                  maritime-related law enforcement. Soon, Alaska will be home to 54, or approximately
                  one fifth, of the entire arsenal of 5th-generation fighters [<a href="#R20">20</a>].

               <p id="d1e185">The concept of human security was developed during the post-Cold War ’90s and has
                  largely been differentiated from national and military security in stressing that
                  individuals as stakeholders are the key focus rather than the state [<a href="#R13">13</a>]. Often, definitions revolve around the need to protect individuals and provide for
                  principles such as freedom, dignity, and/or livelihood. Others focus on protecting
                  individuals from things, such as “freedom from fear” and “freedom from want” [<a href="#R21">21</a>]. According to the UN, “human security is needed in response to the complexity and
                  the interrelatedness of both old and new threats—from chronic and persistent poverty
                  to ethnic violence, human trafficking, climate change, health pandemics, international
                  terrorism, and sudden economic and financial downturns” [<a href="#R22">22</a>].

                  well beyond the national military–centric, if not international military–centric concerns
                  of the past. The extension of these concerns has been demonstrated in the U.S. military’s
                  increased involvement in non-warfighting operations, such as humanitarian assistance
                  and disaster relief, as well as in its newfound efforts to address climate change
                  as a national security interest [<a href="#R23">23</a>]. Within the Arctic, residents currently do not face external nation state–based
                  hostilities due to a system of regional governance and cooperation that has been fostered
                  by the Arctic Council [<a href="#R24">24</a>]. The region does, however, face numerous human-security challenges in the changing
                  dynamics of vegetation, wildlife, and the very environment itself. Still, beyond the
                  external aspects of national security, Alaska in particular faces multiple human security
                  challenges due to food [<a href="#R25">25</a>] and energy security [<a href="#R26">26</a>] issues.

               <p id="d1e231">According to the U.K. Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs, “a country
                  and people are food secure when their food systems operate efficiently in such a way
                  as to remove fear that there will not be enough to eat” [<a href="#R27">27</a>]. At the international level, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United
                  Nations considers food security a success “when all people, at all times, have physical
                  and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary
                  needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life” [<a href="#R28">28</a>]. In a broader sense, food security can effectively be considered on four levels:
                  (a) individual/household, (b) regional, (c) national, and (d) global. Within each
                  level, seven key themes help provide even more in-depth measurement of food security
                  through availability: access, affordability, nutrition and quality, safety, resilience,
                  and confidence [<a href="#R27">27</a>]. Although such definitions provide some meaning, difficulties do exist as food-security
                  metrics might not reflect the problems involving static information, which could impact
                  the flexibility needed to proactively respond to dynamic regional realities [<a href="#R29">29</a>]. Such problems could be the case for the North, especially as the U.S. Arctic continues
                  to experience significant environmental and socio-economic change, where policy and
                  operations will need to consider the looming impacts of food security at the local,
                  state, and regional levels.

               <p id="d1e248">The International Energy Agency defines energy security as the uninterrupted availability
                  of energy sources at an affordable price. Energy security has many aspects. On the
                  one hand, long-term energy security mainly deals with timely investments to supply
                  energy in line with economic developments and environmental needs. On the other hand,
                  short-term energy security focuses on the ability of the energy system to react promptly
                  to sudden changes in the supply–demand balance [<a href="#R30">30</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e253">Dimensions of energy-security definitions, according to the International Energy Agency,
                  include (a) availability, (b) affordability, and (c) acceptability; Hughes [<a href="#R31">31</a>] added a fourth dimension (accessibility). An additional issue related to energy
                  security that will be incorporated into the above is energy independence. Greene examines
                  oil independence, [<a href="#R32">32</a>] noting that, should oil remain a dominant energy source in the near future, oil
                  dependence will continue to be an economic threat in numerous scenarios. He also outlines
                  in his analysis that the U.S. can achieve oil independence through a combined effort
                  to reduce consumption while increasing its oil supply.

               <p id="d1e267">Food security in a changing Arctic is complex and based upon multiple influencing
                  factors that impact the availability, access, distribution, and infrastructure of
                  the indigenous communities, urban-area populations, and industries that support it
                  [<a href="#R33">33</a>]. According to the Alaska Resource Development Council, seafood harvests in Alaska
                  for 2018 accounted for more than 60% of the total U.S. fishing harvest, with an economic
                  impact of $2 billion that extends beyond Alaska and to the entirety of the U.S. [<a href="#R34">34</a>]. To threaten both the food security and economic benefit of Arctic seafood, changes
                  within the Arctic marine food web could be altered soon because of climate change.
                  These changes could affect the migration patterns of fish, with potentially adverse
                  impacts on marine mammals, and, thus, traditional hunting for indigenous coastal communities
                  [<a href="#R35">35</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e278">Another notable consideration to the issue of food security is the conduct of illegal,
                  unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing [<a href="#R36">36</a>]. In the U.S. Arctic today, the consistent security challenge has largely involved
                  the conflicting fishing activity of various nations, especially Southeast Asia. IUU
                  fishing and China is an illustrative example. With the world’s largest population,
                  China’s demand for fish is significant and steady, with supplies unable to be satisfied
                  by resources located in its own coastal waters, driving activity abroad to meet economic
                  and food security needs [<a href="#R37">37</a>]. In response to depletion near inland shores, China has increased subsidies to fishing
                  industries to build larger vessels with increased range, resulting in broader security-related
                  issues beyond near-coastal fishing [<a href="#R38">38</a>]. Furthermore, China’s Beidou navigation satellite system offers the capability to
                  transmit short messages or track other units that could be used to coordinate fishing
                  as well as “maritime reconnaissance” [<a href="#R39">39</a>]. The capability of transiting greater distances with substantially more vessels
                  has continued to pose a threat to U.S. national security in the Arctic, especially
                  when enforcement authorities lack the ability to monitor illicit activity. Moreover,
                  China has consistently demonstrated a willingness to traverse sovereign boundaries
                  and ignore generally accepted international norms [<a href="#R40">40</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e295">Brady observes that food security is key to the Chinese national security strategy
                  and, to that end, related pressures have already adversely impacted local fishing
                  industries globally [<a href="#R8">8</a>]. She likewise points to a Chinese-based report that notes the nation’s interest
                  in Arctic fisheries. Although the previous example focuses on China, the intent is
                  not to associate the State with sanctioned criminal activity but to illustrate a web
                  of the documented complexities often involving several other actors. Although Chinese
                  sub-state actors represent the primary violators, the China government overtly supports
                  the regulation of fisheries while maintaining an active voice to influence frameworks
                  and governance as regulation becomes codified, as demonstrated by the 2017 Central
                  Arctic Ocean Fishing ban, which China has also signed [<a href="#R41">41</a>]. Furthermore, the moratorium on fishing in U.S. Arctic waters also remains one of
                  the strongest protective mechanisms in response to uncertainty of various impacts
                  to fish, which is widely endorsed and supported by virtually all stakeholders [<a href="#R42">42</a>].

               <p id="d1e309">Alaska’s role in national energy security is largely defined by oil production and
                  exportation. The state has in the past been the anchor for U.S. petroleum production
                  and has contributed significantly to the industry since the late 1960s, when oil was
                  discovered in quantities significant enough for large-scale production. While continued
                  development has helped ensure U.S. energy independence and dominance [<a href="#R43">43</a>, <a href="#R44">44</a>], within the larger context of the Arctic, the development of gas and oil is of great
                  interest to numerous countries [<a href="#R45">45</a>, <a href="#R46">46</a>].
               </p>
               <p id="d1e323">Pillar II of the National Security Strategy embraces dominance in the energy sector
                  through diversification and affordable sources [<a href="#R44">44</a>]. In support of that goal, the U.S. finally became an energy net exporter for the
                  first time in 75 years [<a href="#R47">47</a>, <a href="#R48">48</a>]. However, the extent to which U.S. net exportation is sustainable depends on many
                  factors, including Alaska’s contribution to oil and gas. Future production in Alaska
                  partially relies on access to new reserves, including on- and offshore sources. Recent
                  passage of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act required the Secretary of the Interior to establish
                  and administer a competitive oil and gas program from the coastal plain (section 1002)
                  located in Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), effectively ending the 1980 ban
                  [<a href="#R49">49</a>]. ANWR commenced in 2018 with lease sales, which marked the beginning stages of resource
                  exploitation [<a href="#R50">50</a>]; in addition, extraction through shale has further supported the National Security
                  Strategy to ensure energy independence and dominance while reducing leverage against
                  the United States via increases in U.S. net exportation [<a href="#R51">51</a>]. Recent ANWR estimates forecast a 90% increase (3.2 billion barrels) of oil crude
                  production and 6.8 billion barrels of oil from 2031 to 2050 [<a href="#R48">48</a>].
                  
               </p>
               <p id="d1e347">The Beaufort and Chukchi Seas represent the two primary, potential offshore production
                  areas. However, in March 2019, a federal judge ruled and revoked the use of 120 million
                  acres in the U.S. Arctic Ocean nullifying an executive order issued by the current
                  administration [<a href="#R52">52</a>, <a href="#R53">53</a>]. As such, projects in either sea seem unlikely, given regulatory and commodity pricing
                  forces that continue to make production in northern waters economically unappealing
                  at this time.
               </p>
               <p id="d1e355">Aside from Arctic oil, Arctic natural gas has had an increasingly important role for
                  U.S. energy security. However, recovering natural gas in the North has proven difficult,
                  as limited transportation resources and associated costs of extraction challenge the
                  drilling companies’ ability to access resources [<a href="#R54">54</a>]. Moreover, market prices and liquified natural gas ([LNG] which helps boost resource
                  value) technicalities further complicate the appeal of natural gas production. Alaska
                  is not new to natural gas, though. Cook Inlet basin still represents the nation’s
                  oldest natural gas production site since export began in 1967 [<a href="#R55">55</a>]. Notably, operations and transport of natural gas from Cook Inlet are relatively
                  cheap compared to LNG development originating from the North Slope of Alaska. During
                  the Walker Administration, Alaska pursued options to produce its northern gas to market,
                  eventually brokering a deal with China in hopes of establishing a 100-year contract
                  [<a href="#R56">56</a>]; however, the deal fell apart politically and economically, even as aspects of national
                  security emerged as part of the concern, especially in the context of general bilateral
                  foreign trade issues [<a href="#R57">57</a>].

                  <p id="d1e378">Human food security has long been linked to fish as a food source, and U.S. Arctic
                     waters have played an important role in food security for many populations since WWII.
                     A prime example of current impacts to the U.S. Arctic as a result of historical practices
                     is unregulated and unrestricted fishing, which has led to a collapse of the “Donut
                     Hole” located in the Aleutian Basin of the Bering Sea (Figure <a href="#Fig1">1</a>). As a once healthy and thriving fisheries region, known for its productivity of
                     pollock, it drew the attention of numerous international fishing fleets from nations,
                     including the People’s Republic of China, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Poland
                     [<a href="#R53">53</a>]. The Donut Hole, as Balton outlines, is the result of the extension of the fishery
                     zones from both the United States and the former Soviet Union. The area inside of
                     the waters were beyond the jurisdictional control of bordering coastal states.
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e386">The collapse of the Donut Hole was a long time coming considering the historical backdrop
                     provided by Bailey [<a href="#R58">58</a>]. The narrative he provides outlines that the Bering region developed post World
                     War II as an important food source for a Japan that was facing not only “malnutrition”
                     but also “social unrest resulting from food shortages” [<a href="#R58">58</a>]. As Japan developed and modernized its fishing fleet and adapted its wartime radar
                     technology (fish finding), so too did others in the region, including the Republic
                     of Korea and the USSR. Bailey [<a href="#R59">59</a>] escribes that, initially, interest in foreign fishing fleets in the Bering were
                     of little interest, until concern developed in the 1960s that the scope of these operations
                     was beginning to impact the halibut and crab populations, as well as the salmon headed
                     back to spawn in Alaska. In 1976, the United States would take a more assertive role
                     to influence fishing practices of these fleets and prioritize domestic fisherman when
                     it unilaterally extended the Fisheries Conservation Zone (FCZ) out to 200 miles [<a href="#R60">60</a>].
                  </p>
                  <p id="d1e400">The eventual result proved to be one of the most significant global fisheries collapses
                     on record [<a href="#R58">58</a>]. Bailey [<a href="#R59">59</a>] notes the sometimes startling consequences of actions or the lack for taking action.
                     Reported pollock catches from the Donut Hole were at 360,000 tons in 1985, with the
                     total reported catch coming in at 1.5 million tons by 1989. Although interest existed
                     to examine the negative impacts, by this point, it was already too late. Three years
                     later, reported catches in the area amounted to approximately 10,000, signaling a
                     complete collapse of pollock within the area. Ultimately, a moratorium was achieved
                     internationally, with an agreement being signed in 1994, the Convention on the Conservation
                     and Management of the Pollock Resources in the Central Bering Sea.

                  <p id="d1e421">Simply put, Alaska is currently food insecure and, unlike most regions of the United
                     States, does not maintain a balance between locally produced, imported, and exported
                     foods [<a href="#R61">61</a>]. Aside from shorter growing seasons and cold-temperature issues, several other categories
                     of factors explain various agricultural challenges in Alaska, including environmental,
                     geophysical, biological, and socioeconomic difficulties [<a href="#R62">62</a>]. Of all the food consumed by Alaskans, only 5 to 10% is produced in the state [<a href="#R58">58</a>, <a href="#R63">63</a>]. Additionally, as roughly 10% of a family’s income is dedicated to food in the lower
                     48, 14% is the norm for a family in Alaska [<a href="#R64">64</a>]. The more distant one is from an urban area in Alaska, the greater the cost of food,
                     with milk costing $15 a gallon in the community of Kotzebue [<a href="#R65">65</a>]. Importantly, Kotzebue’s study notes that a high cost does not equate to quality
                     but rather reflects the economic cost of distribution to the far end of the supply
                     chain which is largely shouldered by the consumer. Consequently, access, costs, and
                     potential disruption to the supply chain become dynamic contributors to food insecurity.
                     Fairbanks, the second-most densely populated city, sits 180 miles south of the Arctic
                     Circle. As the second largest city, it is estimated to maintain a 3- to 5-day food
                     supply in local stores, compared to Anchorage, which has a 5- to 7-day supply [<a href="#R66">66</a>]. There is also a distinct imbalance between Alaska rural and urban food sources
                     and consumption. For example, wild food harvest [<a href="#R67">67</a>] for 2017 in rural areas averaged 276 pounds per person, while urban harvest accounted
                     for 19 pounds per person on average [<a href="#R68">68</a>] underscoring the reliance on locally procured food in rural areas versus the store
                     bought food in the urban.

               <p id="d1e454">Although improved home construction has increased energy efficiency, the majority
                  of homes in places like Fairbanks were not suitable for the subarctic climate, largely
                  because builders were from the lower 48 states and were not familiar with the environmental
                  conditions [<a href="#R69">69</a>]. Consequently, energy costs for households in the high latitudes remain higher due
                  to their heavy reliance on oil to heat their homes in the winter. Alaska’s harsh winters,
                  energy-intensive oil and natural gas industries, and small population, place the state’s

                  the annual funding of the Power Cost Equalization Program [<a href="#R72">72</a>]. Efforts also include opportunities to transition from fossil fuels. In 2010, Alaska’s
                  legislature established the Alaska State Energy Policy, which set a goal for Alaska
                  to increase its electric generation from renewable and alternative energy sources
                  to 50% by 2025 [<a href="#R14">14</a>]. Hossain, Loring, &amp; Marsik, [<a href="#R26">26</a>] argue that rural Alaska should “have reliable access to socially acceptable energy

                  oil tax regime, energy security for Alaska has been less than nominal, especially
                  since the 2008 global fiscal crisis. Moreover, rural Alaska’s dependence on fuel oil
                  remains vulnerable to problems, some of which involve national and human security.
                  For example, in the fall of 2011, Nome Alaska experienced a severe storm that prevented
                  the annual scheduled delivery of fuel to the community. Estimates of increased fuel
                  prices ranged from $5.40 to $9 per gallon if brought in by plane. In the end, the
                  solution involved a Russian ice-hardened tanker escorted by a USCG ice breaker to
                  deliver vital fuel in January 2012—in mid-Winter—with reserves running low [<a href="#R73">73</a>].

                  industry supports the nation’s $6 billion seafood industry [<a href="#R74">74</a>] and subsequently contributes to not only U.S. but global food security. Alaska led
                  all states in volume, with landings of 60 billion pounds with a value of $1.8 billion,
                  as well as 158 processing plants and wholesalers and nearly ten people employed [<a href="#R75">75</a>]. According to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, [<a href="#R68">68</a>] fish directly accounted for nearly 54% of wild food harvest in rural Alaskan areas
                  while providing about 14% of caloric needs and 95% of protein needs in 2017 (Figure
                  <a href="#Fig3">3</a>). Indirectly, the same report indicates other food sources that are dependent on
                  fish (land mammals) and/or impacted by illicit fishing practices (marine mammals).

               <p id="d1e514">The effects of climate change on food security remain a convergence both at the federal
                  and local levels but for different reasons. Conversely, from a human security perspective,
                  indigenous and rural communities throughout the U.S. Arctic remain affected by several
                  factors, including changing food availability and vulnerability, as well as limited
                  transportation infrastructure. Caulfield [<a href="#R76">76</a>] underscores that, for smaller and indigenous communities, the problems are even
                  more manifest because they are impacted by the availability of essentials, fluctuations
                  in pricing, and a long and often costly distribution process. For many of these communities,
                  subsistence hunting and fishing are important in both a literal (survival) and cultural
                  food security context. The use of cash or bartering in Alaska often buys necessities,
                  such as snowmobiles, fuel, food, and ammunition [<a href="#R77">77</a>]. Moreover, higher prices (e.g., for food and energy) require people to work multiple
                  jobs, which in turn limits time for subsistence hunting and fishing, thus adding to
                  food insecurity. Importantly, food security through availability and access, coupled
                  with subsistence hunting and fishing, plays a critical role in the health security
                  in rural communities [<a href="#R78">78</a>]. In general, an estimated 65% of Alaska residents utilize some form of subsistence

                  health, and environmental security but also presents opportunities. Gjørv <i>et al.</i> [<a href="#R80">80</a>] states, “Security in the Arctic has focused on issues of power, resource exploitation,
                  and territory these issues continue to influence government policy. While the idea
                  of energy security persists with governments to secure energy resources, often power

                  to develop the additional flow needed to mitigate potential increased maintenance
                  costs as well as to ensure continued energy dominance. Adding to the complexity of
                  providing for energy security and economic profitability, the cost for oil and natural
                  gas resource development in Alaska, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration,

                  for natural gas to help offset heating costs and pollution. However, the State of
                  Alaska has had a different focus on its desire for natural gas, namely the pursuit
                  of exportation, which does nothing for communities directly, but could offer indirect
                  benefits as revenues are collected. However, several obstacles prevent the full use
                  of LNG beyond extraction, including treatment, liquefaction, transport, storage, and
                  regasification, to name a few. Gasification alone involves numerous technical difficulties

            <p id="d1e597">The nexus of both human and national security interests within the U.S. Arctic is
               remarkable considering the recognized challenges regarding security in the larger
               Arctic setting. The relationship and overlap between human and national security interests
               within the U.S. Arctic increasingly demonstrate a strong connection to changing dynamics
               of the region and how those changes not only serve as an example to the overlapping
               nature of the national and human security, but how this region will continue to serve
               as a benchmark in exposing those concerns. While, globally, it is increasingly recognized
               that human security concerns are becoming more pronounced as international conflict
               between nation states declines [<a href="#R23">23</a>], Alaska remains of significant geostrategic importance to U.S. due to national security
               interests and its location [<a href="#R10">10</a>].
            </p>
            <p id="d1e605">Human security concerns within the U.S. Arctic are likewise both complex and prominent.
               As a land of extremes, Alaska will remain as long as people continue to live in an
               environment rife with challenges such as isolation and climate, yet rich in remarkable
               beauty, resources, and cultural roots and strengths. While external global threats
               might not loom large for individuals within the region [<a href="#R24">24</a>], the changing climate is altering the physical landscape in relation to permafrost
               and, as a consequence, the longer term viability of Arctic infrastructure and its
               residents way of life. To drill down into the human security aspects of the U.S. Arctic,
               climate change has altered the physical landscape such that indigenous peoples of
               the U.S. Arctic are finding it difficult to “put food on the table” [<a href="#R83">83</a>]. Still, as a state on the front lines of climate change, its efforts in proactive
               adaptation planning will serve to potentially reduce not only the costs but the impacts
               of a changing climate [<a href="#R84">84</a>].

                        requirements of the U. S. is both very real and significant. In historical and contemporary
                        contexts, Alaska has significantly contributed to and enabled the nation to achieve
                        both energy dominance and independence [<a href="#R85">85</a>]. Vast oil and natural gas estimates indicate the presence of other production areas,
                        such as the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas which could prove to further reinforce energy
                        security and independence going into the future. These areas could serve to extend
                        the significance of the U.S. Arctic as an energy resource–rich region well into the
                        future. However, the appetite as well as the cost for development and operations may
                        come into conflict with this region realizing its full potential and the energy security

                        <i>Intersection of Food Security with a National Security Backdrop</i>. The $3 billion seafood industry of Alaska continues to support the economic largesse
                        of a $6 billion U.S. parent industry. Nationally, Dutch Harbor has led the nation
                        with the highest amount of seafood landed for more than two decades, with approximately
                        770 million pounds alone in 2017 [<a href="#R75">75</a>]. Likewise, as the report highlights, this industry provides approximately 15% of
                        rural Alaskans’ employment, with an extended national impact of creating 99,000 full-time
                        equivalent jobs. The perspectives drawn from this evidence illustrate how the economics
                        of fisheries relate to both the national security significance of a food rich region,
                        but further underscore how seafood contributes to the economic basis of human security
                        at a more localized level. Current impacts to fisheries from illicit activity continue
                        to represent issues closely associated with national security, with the potential
                        to escalate into higher tension or conflict. However, as previously developed, the
                        region is not on the cusp of conflict as diplomatic intervention has proven itself
                        effective in negotiated agreements to safeguard valuable fishing areas.

                        longer term climate-change adaptation. At the same time, the traditional need for
                        energy is real, particularly considering the backdrop of Alaska’s cold winters and
                        ensuing energy consumption rates as compared to the Lower 48. Beyond the simple need
                        to meet the energy demands of Alaska through the use of home heating oil and natural
                        gas, the state’s economy depends greatly on the production of these resources for
                        its revenue and longer term financial viability. This unique juxtaposition leaves
                        Alaska at odds with itself. Although the state contributes to the energy and human
                        security needs of those who live and work there, revenue, resulting from the royalties
                        realized from the sovereign wealth fund represent the largest contribution toward
                        investment, and thus, returns (currently Alaska’s largest revenue source)—which comes
                        at a time when climate change and environmental issues have become more contentious.

                        of the region, and yet, its fragility. Whereas Bailey notes that the socioeconomic
                        aspects of the collapse might not significantly affect the local fishing and indigenous
                        communities, overfishing of the region has indeed had a longer term impact, as fishing
