                                 to military aspects has given way to new elements of analysis. New sectors and actors
                                 in the framework of national security took the stage. Starting from the evolution
                                 of the concept of national security, this article presents the modalities through

                              <p id="d1e82">Security is a dimension inherent to human beings [<a href="#R1">1</a>]. It involves the protection of an asset, which could be personal safety, belongings,
                                 wealth or more immaterial elements such as sets of values, identity and traditions.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e87">The perception of security implicates personal constructs and beliefs [<a href="#R2">2</a>] associated with the protection or with the undermining of such elements. It has
                                 been mostly studied at the individual level, but there are important consequences
                                 even on the social sphere [<a href="#R3">3</a>]. This article is built upon the concept that individual experiences are largely
                                 dependent on—and, in turn, influence—social constructs and dynamics. Oftentimes, personal
                                 experiences are fused into group practices, and the boundaries between the self and
                                 the other are frequently blurred. In a context such as a nation, the dual nature of
                                 security, individual and collectivistic, is even more pronounced and complex. Indeed,
                                 we can understand the preservation of national assets as guaranteeing the welfare
                                 of its constituents, the citizens. In turn, citizens are called upon to contribute
                                 whenever possible to the maintenance of a condition of national security.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e95">Starting with a historical overview of how the political sector has taken into consideration
                                 citizens’ perceptions and attitudes, the article will focus on how security studies
                                 have addressed this subject over the last decades. It will highlight how the academic
                                 sector and policymakers have increasingly taken into consideration the public dimension
                                 of measures and decisions aimed at protecting national security. Indeed, in the last
                                 twenty years, both the academic and political sectors redefined the importance of
                                 citizens’ perceptions and attitudes in the matter of national security. On the one
                                 hand, there has been a change of focus in security studies, which, at their birth,
                                 sought to tackle the analysis of security issues from a perspective almost uniquely
                                 centred around military aspects. More recently, they have started to account for the
                                 societal dimension. On the other hand, there has been a growing interest of the political
                                 sector in understanding what citizens perceive and think of issues related to national
                                 security, particularly since the Cold War and even more since the terrorist attacks
                                 occurred on 11/09/2001 in the US.

                                    <p id="d1e103">We can trace the concept of citizenry as it is understood nowadays in Western society
                                       back to the Ancient Greece period. At that time, citizens actively contributed to
                                       the life of the ‘‘polis’’ (city), and politics (the affairs of the city) consisted
                                       of making decisions for the good of it. The mixture of the individual and political
                                       sphere was indissoluble, and since the debate about security was and still is one
                                       of the priorities of politics [<a href="#R4">4</a>], citizens’ voices are crucial in this matter.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e108">Overall, national security consists of the laws, decisions and behaviours aimed at
                                       protecting the fundamental assets of a nation. It is a concept which has been debated
                                       in the academic, security and political sectors for a long time and for which scholars
                                       have provided different definitions [<a href="#R5">5</a>, <a href="#R6">6</a>, <a href="#R7">7</a>]. Although most of them rely on the protection of the state against external invasions,
                                       success in war and defence of borders, others include the human security of citizens
                                       [<a href="#R8">8</a>].
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e122">For different reasons, over the centuries, the involvement of citizens in national
                                       security strategies was scarce. Nevertheless, history has presented cases when citizens
                                       actively participated in decision-making processes for the good of the security of
                                       the political government in force. For example, in Ancient Rome, young citizens were
                                       enrolled in the military to defend the Empire [<a href="#R9">9</a>] and earning trust from the populations of lands just conquered was considered an
                                       asset to protect the security of the borders [<a href="#R10">10</a>]. Other activities carried out by Roman citizens would now be referred to as ‘‘human
                                       intelligence’’ (HUMINT): they acquired information on potential security threats and
                                       reported them to the authorities [<a href="#R11">11</a>]. The city-states in the Italian peninsula make another historical example of the
                                       role of citizens for security during the late Middle Ages. All citizens were entitled
                                       to participate in the so-called assembly [<a href="#R12">12</a>], the primary institution where political decisions were taken. In modern times,
                                       only a few cases of direct democracy of this kind exist; more often, citizens exercise

                                       democracies is debated [<a href="#R13">13</a>], but formally citizenry still has decision-making power via its political representatives.
                                       The role of citizens in national security has historically also taken other forms.

                                       idea of the strength of the nation’s security apparatuses. Indeed, oftentimes, citizens
                                       were shown in the regime propaganda as cheerfully supporting military parades and
                                       displays of military equipment [<a href="#R14">14</a>], and were particularly keen in listening to political leaders while they were showing
                                       off new measures to defend national security.

                                       to national security has been studied. More than that, the modalities through which
                                       they perceive security issues have come into play in the political realm and in academic
                                       investigation [<a href="#R15">15</a>]. The present research is positioned in this thematic area. One of its objectives
                                       is demonstrating how the analysis of citizens’ perceptions of security issues can
                                       modulate the drafting, implementation or termination of national security programs.
                                       In this regard, one of the most emblematic examples is the Total Information Awareness
                                       (TIA) program in the US, aimed at preventing terrorist attacks by collecting and analysing
                                       information from US citizens. In 2003 the US Congress cut the funding of this program
                                       because of US citizens’ negative perceptions of it. Another emblematic example is
                                       the Israeli National Security and Public Opinion Project, which aims at studying the
                                       public opinion concerning security issues involving Israel and, most importantly,
                                       their implications for Israeli national security.

                                    <p id="d1e165">Many of the works in the current literature on perceptions of security issues investigate
                                       how people perceive security threats [<a href="#R16">16</a>, <a href="#R17">17</a>]. This occurrence is interesting for different reasons: why are most of the researchers
                                       particularly keen in studying the perceptions of security threats and not, for example,
                                       citizens’ attitudes towards security services or citizens’ perceptions of security
                                       programs in times of peace? Why did such a significant number of studies on the perceptions
                                       of threats to national security flourish after terrorist attacks in the last two decades?
                                       The perception of the imminence of a security issue might have played a role, but
                                       I here advance another hypothesis. Although security threats have always been a significant
                                       topic in security studies, there was a period when the concept of threat started to
                                       be extended to domains other than the military and possibly closer to every citizen’s
                                       life. We can identify this period with the emergence of critical security studies,
                                       and, more specifically, with the Copenhagen School of security studies. By highlighting
                                       the relevance of threats undermining social dynamics, the economy and the environment,
                                       I hypothesize that the Copenhagen School influenced subsequent research, which not
                                       only aimed to study how people perceive national security issues per se but also the
                                       implications for their lives. Therefore, the Copenhagen School might have had the
                                       merit of initiating the process of democratization of security studies by putting
                                       citizens’ experiences at the centre of the investigation.

                                    <p id="d1e173">With the birth of critical security studies and, in particular, with the contribution
                                       of the Copenhagen School, the definition of national security has grown to encompass
                                       dimensions other than the military and has highlighted the concept of multidimensional
                                       threats. Security was referred to as the situation in which a referent object survives
                                       when a threat undermines its existence [<a href="#R18">18</a>]. A referent object was conceptualized as an entity which could take various forms
                                       depending on the sector which has been chosen as the subject of the investigation
                                       (e.g., economic security, environmental security, political security, etc.). Even
                                       the United Nations (UN) proposed a new concept of security, which shifted from exclusive
                                       stress to territorial security to greater attention put on the people’s security.
                                       The idea of security introduced by the UN encompassed seven main categories, namely
                                       economic, food, health, environmental, personal, community and political security
                                       [<a href="#R19">19</a>].
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e181">This new definition of security is revolutionary in itself: it does not make explicit
                                       reference to military security, the state or external aggressors. However, it does
                                       not remove it from the discussion either: the classical concept of security could
                                       still be implemented in this theoretical approach. It is now not the only one but
                                       one of many sectors which could be analysed. Moreover, independence and sovereignty
                                       are only two of the many referent objects that should be defended to preserve national
                                       security.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e183">The Copenhagen School redefined the objective of security studies, whose novel aim
                                       was to analyse the origins and consequences of threats to referent objects. Another
                                       dimension brought into the discourse of security was securitization, which might be
                                       considered an extreme version of politicization [<a href="#R18">18</a>]. It is the process according to which an event is transformed into the object of
                                       political debate. Securitization can be thought of as a step forward, not only an
                                       alternative version of politicization. It encompasses the political discussion of
                                       potential security threats but also transforms the debate into practical actions to
                                       protect national security.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e188">The Copenhagen School’s analysis can be considered ground-breaking even from another
                                       angle: it not only proposed the exploration of sectors relevant for security different
                                       from the military but also introduced different levels of investigation—that is, global,
                                       national, regional, etc. [<a href="#R20">20</a>]. Moreover, it stressed the dual nature of the investigation, which could be top-down
                                       or bottom-up. In particular, the latter explores the influence of human nature and
                                       individual differences on the functioning of collective entities such as regions,
                                       nations and states. The crucial aspect is understanding the characteristics of each
                                       level and identifying the best-suited methods of analysis to investigate them. In
                                       light of a bottom-up process of investigation, this theorization is justified: smaller
                                       entities constitute the founding pillars of more prominent structures (e.g., nations).
                                       Nevertheless, in a top-down process, the analysis of the dynamics at different levels
                                       might be perceived as unnecessary. Since the measures taken to preserve security are
                                       imposed on citizens, behaviours are constrained by these impositions, and their analysis
                                       is likely to produce distorted results.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e193">The differentiation of levels, and implicitly the legitimization of studying the individual-level
                                       dynamics, is justified for another reason. According to Buzan and colleagues, a securitizing
                                       move is accomplished only when the audience accepts it as such [<a href="#R18">18</a>]. An essential aspect to note is that the success of a securitizing move is decided
                                       not by the securitizing actor but by the audience of the securitizing move. Therefore,
                                       as proposed by Waever [<a href="#R21">21</a>], security exists not within the object of security itself but rather among the subjects
                                       which contributed to make an issue a security issue.

                                    <p id="d1e201">In a nutshell, one of the most significant contributions of the Copenhagen School
                                       was moving from the classical conception of security studies as military security
                                       studies and including new sectors and security actors. They will be presented in the

                                    <p id="d1e206">An innovative aspect brought by critical security studies is the introduction of sectors
                                       not strictly related to the classical conception of security studies, and therefore
                                       not exclusively linked to the military sector. Indeed, the Copenhagen School identified
                                       new sectors vital for a nation’s life; it specified their assets, the securitizing
                                       moves to protect them and the actors involved. These dimensions will be further analysed
                                       in this section. The process of ‘‘democratization’’ of security studies, mentioned
                                       earlier, finds application in the theorization of the Copenhagen School. Indeed, most
                                       of the recent studies which analysed people’s perceptions of threats to national security
                                       had their focus on threats to the economy [<a href="#R22">22</a>], social dynamics [<a href="#R23">23</a>] and everyday life [<a href="#R24">24</a>], and rarely on military threats not directly involving citizens.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e217">The introduction of different sectors into the analysis of security studies puts forward
                                       the necessity to investigate the dimensions which, in their totality, define security:
                                       these are the referent objects, the securitizing actors and the functional actors.
                                       The referent objects are those entities that are threatened and whose survival justifies
                                       the securitizing move. The securitizing actors are those actors who define an entity
                                       as a referent object and who propose its securitization. The functional actors are
                                       those actors who, without being securitizing actors, influence the process by affecting
                                       its dynamics. The referent objects are specific to each sector. Traditionally, the
                                       securitizing actors are stakeholders and often politicians. This concept has been
                                       implemented even by the Copenhagen School, and it is in line with the classical theorization
                                       of critical security studies. Nevertheless, if we consider the claim about citizens
                                       as security stakeholders valid [<a href="#R25">25</a>], we cannot help but include citizens in the group of securitizing actors. Indeed,
                                       through the exercise of their voting right, through the participation in governmental

                                       actively contribute to the securitizing process of an issue. The functional actors
                                       are nonetheless important since they influence the decisions in the field of security
                                       [<a href="#R27">27</a>]. Traditionally, citizens have been included in this group, but the studies mentioned
                                       earlier demonstrated that they can be legitimately considered as both securitizing
                                       and functional actors.

                                       play important roles since they are actors or even referent objects of national security

                                          <p id="d1e233">The military sector has been, for a long time, the only sector present in national
                                             security strategies [<a href="#R28">28</a>]. Although critical security studies transformed the view on national security, the
                                             military sector, given its nature, is the sector most institutionalized and with a
                                             traditionally more rigid sectorization of roles and functions. The referent object
                                             has conventionally been the state, although it is not the only one. In other terms,
                                             the state’s diverse constituents, such as sovereignty, independence and wealth, represent
                                             referent objects per se.
                                          </p>
                                          <p id="d1e238">The threats posed to the referent objects in the military sectors might be internal
                                             or external military threats. They might be even non-military [<a href="#R18">18</a>], such as immigration, ideologies and values. In this sense, individuals may be involved
                                             not only in the securitizing process but may also constitute the source of a threat.
                                             With regard to the securitizing actors, politicians and military officials are often
                                             considered the only responsible for a securitizing move. Moreover, intelligence services
                                             often consider themselves as the guardians of national security [<a href="#R18">18</a>]. Nevertheless, if we consider the intricate process of acquisition of information
                                             from human intelligence, the military sector cannot ignore the involvement of citizens
                                             in this process. Moreover, in some states, the influence of tribes and ethnic groups
                                             are so influential in national security issues that they cannot be disregarded as
                                             securitizing actors. For example, as Cordesman pointed out, the tribal—or Fouji forces—in
                                             Saudi Arabia conduct operations vital to national security, such as border patrols
                                             [<a href="#R29">29</a>]. On the other hand, ethnic militant groups may be responsible for escalating national
                                             security crises, as it happened in Nigeria since the mid-2000s [<a href="#R30">30</a>].
                                          </p>
                                          <p id="d1e252">Although their role might be perceived as not strictly relevant to the military sector,
                                             some functional actors can influence the decisions made by the military apparatuses.
                                             For example, the governments are those entities which could massively influence the
                                             securitizing process despite, in many cases, having interests different from national
                                             security, such as the retention of power [<a href="#R31">31</a>]. The population can be considered a functional actor in the sense that it can oppose
                                             security measures in the name of the lack of respect for human rights. Some characteristics
                                             may play an essential role in influencing the dynamics of a securitizing move and
                                             thus can be considered functional actors. For instance, geographic factors are crucial
                                             in altering the perception of a threat which could be close or far in space, imminent
                                             or distant in time. More specifically, distance and terrain may change how a threat
                                             perpetrated by an external agent is perceived. Another element highly relevant for
                                             perception of threats in the military sector is history: a recent history of wars
                                             and clashes makes it easier to trigger the perception of an imminent threat in the
                                             population as well as in the political and military representatives.

                                             is state sovereignty, but its securitization follows a different pathway in the political
                                             realm.

                                             could be the object of a politicizing discourse. Nevertheless, political security
                                             has a distinctive feature from politics as it is commonly understood: it deals with
                                             threats to the internal legitimacy of political units and with the external recognition
                                             of the state.

                                             discourse is not only the defence of the territorial state, as it might appear in

                                          <p id="d1e281">The societal sector is central to the present investigation. Counter intuitively,
                                             when talking about national security, the nation has often received less attention
                                             than its political counterpart—the state. Consequently, its constitutive elements—the
                                             people—have been repeatedly excluded from national security discourses. With the emergence
                                             of critical security studies, the social dimension acquired a new interest in academic
                                             research.
                                          </p>
                                          <p id="d1e283">In the societal sector, identity is a crucial element: it defines the expectations
                                             and rights of the individuals in relation to society [<a href="#R34">34</a>]. When a group of individuals recognizes a common identity and shared values, a societal
                                             group exists. Although societies can be discovered at regional, national and international
                                             levels, my focus here is on the national level. When a threat undermines group identity,
                                             the entire societal group is threatened. For this reason, some scholars in international
                                             relations use the concept of identity when referring to this type of security [<a href="#R35">35</a>]. Therefore, group identity can be considered the main referent object of societal
                                             security. At the same time, we can consider the nation as the referent object of societal
                                             security [<a href="#R36">36</a>]. This concept is relevant for this study if we consider that what keeps nations
                                             together is national identity, which is characterized by religious or ethnic factors.
                                             Generally, the nation corresponds to its political counterpart, the state. For this
                                             reason, the object of societal security is often the state.

                                          <p id="d1e294">Some threats could undermine group identity and, consequently, the nation. For example,
                                             migration may lead to a shift in the composition of the population. This may happen
                                             by altering the cultural and linguistic identity of a nation. It can also happen that
                                             a superordinate program aims to integrate different national groups (e.g., the European
                                             Union) or separate one national group (e.g., secessionist movements). It is worth
                                             noting that all of these issues have implications, even at the individual level, and
                                             the sum of personal experiences makes them issues for societal security.

                                          <p id="d1e296">According to Buzan and colleagues, society can respond to threats in two ways: via
                                             activities conducted by the community itself or by shifting the problem to the political
                                             and military sector [<a href="#R18">18</a>]. The latter option, which has often occurred, explains why the societal, political
                                             and military sectors are so interdependent and why society and, consequently, citizens,
                                             although overlooked in classical security studies, are a determinant of national security.

                                       and the new concepts introduced by critical security studies, greater attention was
                                       paid to the consequences that security issues have on individuals’ lives. Even this

                                       in those years. The terrorist events that disrupted the lives of thousands of people
                                       highlighted the necessity to investigate the consequences of national security events
                                       in citizens’ lives. This necessity triggered the flourishing of studies on how citizens
                                       felt during security incidents and how those events would affect their future behaviours.
                                       This section explores how security studies evolved from being a discipline almost
                                       entirely focused on military security aspects to comprise, in more recent times, the
                                       study of citizens’ perceptions of security issues.

                                    <p id="d1e375">Security studies were born as a sub-field of International Relations discipline, after
                                       World War II [<a href="#R43">43</a>]. The subject of investigation of classical security studies as they were conceived
                                       in the Cold War era was the state’s security and military security. At the same time,
                                       the space given to citizens was minimal: researchers and politicians saw national
                                       security as the defence of national borders [<a href="#R44">44</a>] and military preparedness in the case of an external attack. Consequently, citizens’
                                       experiences were not at the centre of academic investigation. However, if we consider
                                       a nation as a group of citizens who share the same feeling of identity [<a href="#R45">45</a>], limiting the investigative horizon only to military aspects might constitute an
                                       oversimplification of the elaborate matrix of variables at stake. Only with the advent
                                       of academic works that we now identify as ‘‘critical security studies’’ [<a href="#R46">46</a>], dimensions other than the military began to be taken into consideration and analysed
                                       in the context of national security.

                                       became an essential factor in security studies [<a href="#R47">47</a>] and individual experiences were frequently put at the centre of the research in
                                       this area. The input given by the 9/11 terrorist attacks played a crucial role. It
                                       made people in general, and researchers in particular, more aware of how individual
                                       factors shape the experience of security issues [<a href="#R37">37</a>]. Indeed, since 9/11, several studies emerged, investigating how people subjectively
                                       felt during the events which undermined US national security [<a href="#R48">48</a>]. This shift of investigative focus can be considered as important as the emergence
                                       of critical security studies. Within the space of a few decades, security studies
                                       changed considerably. It started with being almost exclusively focused on military
                                       aspects, then encompassed new dimensions of security, such as immigration, transnational
                                       crimes and societal intra-state dynamics. In the last two decades, the literature
                                       has included extensive research on the individual experiences of people who have been
                                       involved in events related to national security. The academic research on this topic
                                       narrowed down the breadth of the issues investigated. Indeed, the individual experiences
                                       which recently have acquired so much interest form in their totality the societal
                                       dimension which the Copenhagen School proposed in its innovative writings [<a href="#R18">18</a>, <a href="#R49">49</a>].

                                    <p id="d1e421">The shift of research focus from critical to contemporary security studies went hand
                                       in hand with a greater awareness of the importance of citizens within the political
                                       sector [<a href="#R50">50</a>]. There were examples of national security programs halted because of the lack of
                                       public consensus [<a href="#R51">51</a>]. Moreover, some programs aimed at investigating what people think of security measures
                                       were introduced by governments [<a href="#R52">52</a>]. Additionally, calls for participation of citizens in the definition of security
                                       strategies [<a href="#R53">53</a>] were put in place. Previously, politicians rarely took into consideration the public
                                       dimension of security issues; one of the few examples is the outburst of research
                                       investigating public opinion towards the Vietnam War [<a href="#R54">54</a>]. Particularly in Western society, the emergence of academic works providing evidence
                                       of differential individual experiences associated with security threats stimulated
                                       an interest in the political sector for better understanding of what citizens feel
                                       and think of national security.

                                    <p id="d1e446">Citizens’ perceptions of threats to national security have been studied in different
                                       fields [<a href="#R55">55</a>, <a href="#R56">56</a>, <a href="#R57">57</a>]. However, a lack of combination of research designs, methods and topics explored
                                       still affects the current literature. The fact that critical security studies are
                                       a new discipline should, on the contrary, stimulate a greater integration of methods
                                       and results, thus favouring the applicability of findings.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e457">As stated earlier, the research in this field received a massive boost following the
                                       9/11 terrorist attacks. In the subsequent years, much of the literature on threat
                                       perception in security studies has been centred around threats posed by international
                                       terrorism [<a href="#R22">22</a>, <a href="#R58">58</a>]. This focus on only one type of threat is probably due to a methodological bias:
                                       as illustrated by Lupia and Menning [<a href="#R59">59</a>] and taken up by Stevens and Vaughan-Williams [<a href="#R60">60</a>], researchers have the habit of asking about events that they think have elicited
                                       reactions in the population. This occurrence brings a series of consequences such
                                       as not considering that this might not have been the case or that other factors may
                                       have had an influence. Moreover, most of the investigations of this kind took place
                                       in the immediate aftermath or only a few months after the terrorist event. This might
                                       bias the results by making people’s responses stronger because the event is close
                                       in time. The new stream of security studies widened the discussion to topics and situations
                                       not directly related to conflicts, terrorism and imminent threats, by including actors,
                                       situations and habits that constitute the nation’s security sector. For this reason,
                                       the analysis of event-related reactions might be only partly informative. In fact,
                                       Huddy and colleagues [<a href="#R22">22</a>] stated that Americans were concerned about terrorism well before the 9/11 attacks.
                                       A study conducted by the Rand Corporation in 1988 and 1989 [<a href="#R61">61</a>] showed that a large part of Americans considered terrorism a severe issue in the
                                       US. In particular, this study showed that 98% of respondents considered terrorism
                                       a serious problem. Other survey studies conducted in the following years showed the
                                       same type of results. Specifically, the research carried out by Sönmez and Graefe
                                       highlighted that 57% of respondents that the possibility of terrorist events would
                                       discourage them from travelling internationally [<a href="#R62">62</a>]. Despite the evidence of this concern about terrorism in the population, it took
                                       years before terrorism was recognized as a major concern for the population [<a href="#R22">22</a>]. For example, Nacos and colleagues reported that in July 2005, shortly after the
                                       terrorist attacks occurred in London, 75% of Americans reckoned that another terrorist
                                       event was very likely or somewhat likely to happen. This value was 4 percent more
                                       than the percentage of Americans expressing this feeling shortly after the 9/11 events
                                       [<a href="#R37">37</a>].
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e487">Only in more recent years has research broadened to include those topics not strictly
                                       connected to terrorism. Among others, the most analysed cases have been immigration
                                       [<a href="#R63">63</a>], ethnic issues [<a href="#R64">64</a>], cyber-security [<a href="#R65">65</a>] and natural disasters [<a href="#R66">66</a>]. A specific stream of research in the psychology literature on perception of threats
                                       to national security examines the psychological predispositions to certain types of
                                       reactions. For example, people with a diagnosis of one or more anxiety disorders tend
                                       to show stronger responses to threats compared to controls [<a href="#R67">67</a>]. Similarly, other variables come into play when investigating the modulation of
                                       reactions to threats: the literature abounds with studies about differences in threat
                                       perception based on gender [<a href="#R58">58</a>], age [<a href="#R68">68</a>] and values [<a href="#R58">58</a>]. Some other works analysed the different behavioural outcomes of citizens in response
                                       to threats [<a href="#R22">22</a>]. However, it is essential to note that all effects are at least partly mediated
                                       by innate predispositions or contextual situations.
                                       
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e517">In terms of its usefulness for the security services and political sector, the analysis
                                       of citizens’ perceptions of security threats is essential for different reasons. Firstly,
                                       perceived threats to national security have, as existing research suggests [<a href="#R69">69</a>, <a href="#R70">70</a>], negative impact on political tolerance. Secondly, the perception of existential
                                       threats may result in intergroup fairness and endorsement of pacifism and less aggression
                                       toward outgroups (e.g., foreigners and people of other religions) [<a href="#R71">71</a>]. Moreover, as mentioned earlier, a public who feels threatened is more likely to
                                       accept security measures and interventions that might not be accepted in ordinary
                                       conditions; as such, it is crucial to understand the time and the modalities through
                                       which those policies should be presented. Thirdly, since by definition power pertains
                                       to citizens in democracies, the political sector should take into account what citizens
                                       feel, what they think and how they react to issues related to such a crucial element
                                       as national security. Incidentally, previous studies have highlighted that the political
                                       sector is not immune from being affected by these mechanisms [<a href="#R72">72</a>]; instead public opinion may influence the political elites and vice versa. This
                                       process would necessitate an analysis of the perception of threats at the community
                                       and individual level.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e531">Moreover, from a methodological perspective, the importance of the national context
                                       in studying the perception of security threats has been demonstrated [<a href="#R73">73</a>]. Most of the current knowledge derives from studies conducted in the US or the UK.
                                       Hence, most of the theories and inferences on this topic originated from results of
                                       studies conducted in just two countries. For this reason, the need for less generalized
                                       and more contextualized works has been identified [<a href="#R60">60</a>].
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e539">The lack of integration among the disciplines involved will hopefully be alleviated
                                       in future research. This interdisciplinary approach is applied to the exploration
                                       of a crucial topic, emotional responses to security threats, which is undertaken below.

                                    <p id="d1e544">As is the case with other constructs in scientific research, the term ‘‘perception’’
                                       encompasses different dimensions such as social [<a href="#R74">74</a>], cognitive [<a href="#R75">75</a>] and affective [<a href="#R76">76</a>]. Until the 1980s, the focus of research in threat perception was on cognitive aspects,
                                       probably mirroring what has happened in the realm of experimental psychology. With
                                       the advent of affective science and neuroscience in the 1980s, more attention was
                                       put on emotional processes. Moreover, previous evidence demonstrated that some emotional
                                       experiences can have a great influence on future behaviour [<a href="#R77">77</a>, <a href="#R78">78</a>, <a href="#R79">79</a>]. Even political discourses on national security targeted at citizens often aim to
                                       trigger emotional reactions in the audience, with the hope that this could influence
                                       their political views. Nevertheless, there is still significant uncertainty regarding
                                       which emotions play a role when a threat is perceived. Common sense would suggest
                                       that fear is the most probable reaction to such stimuli. In fact, the picture could
                                       be more complex and diverse emotional experiences could take place, leading to very
                                       different consequences in terms of future behaviour. This section’s objective is to
                                       provide a brief overview of one of the main topics of the present research, that is,
                                       the importance of emotional responses to national security threats.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e565">As mentioned above, threat perception has been studied in a wide range of disciplines,
                                       but mostly in psychology. In the literature on threat perception, the phenomenon has
                                       been analysed in relation to clinical conditions [<a href="#R80">80</a>] and threatening stimuli depicting animals [<a href="#R81">81</a>]. Until the 1980s, most of it was centred around cognitive biases originating from
                                       the perception of threats. In the 1980s, the academic world witnessed the advent of
                                       affective neuroscience, which has the objective of studying neural correlates of emotions.
                                       From that period onwards, research on threat perception took the emotional dimensions
                                       of the phenomenon more into account. The focus on cognitive aspects which characterized
                                       the research until that point is understandable if we take into account that it was
                                       commonplace in psychology to consider cognitive processes—usually referred to as ‘‘superior
                                       processes’’—as overriding and independent from phenomena of different nature. In more
                                       recent years, scientific findings highlighted the link between emotions and cognition
                                       [<a href="#R82">82</a>]. These findings boosted new research on the affective correlates of psychological
                                       processes.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e576">The investigation of threat perception in national security has been biased to a lesser
                                       extent by this misconception on the importance of the emotions. The relevant studies
                                       on threat perception in national security emerged mostly in the last two decades,
                                       and the acceptance of the role of emotions within the scientific community was by
                                       then already established. Indeed, it is not infrequent to find questions on how a
                                       person felt during an event related to national security, which emotions were prevalent
                                       and how that person would behave in the future following those feelings [<a href="#R22">22</a>].

                                    <p id="d1e581">Nevertheless, for a long time, there has not been agreement on which emotions come
                                       into play when a person perceives the existence of a security threat. Indeed, one
                                       of the emotions which has been more frequently associated with the perception of threat
                                       is fear. Fear is mainly present in individual experiences of threat, but existing
                                       studies have shown that it is not the only emotion involved. For example, in 2009
                                       Huddy proposed what has been one of the most detailed reviews on emotional correlates
                                       on threat perception in the context of national security [<a href="#R72">72</a>]. She started from an examination of the antecedents of threat perception before
                                       analysing the two dimensions which she considered prevalently associated with the
                                       perception of security threats: anxiety and anger. In doing so, she showed that diverse
                                       emotional responses occur when different dimensions come into play. For example, realistic
                                       and symbolic threats are likely to induce very different reactions in the perceiver.
                                       The same is valid for collective and individual threats. These variables have been
                                       associated with two basic motivational systems: the approach system and the avoidance
                                       system [<a href="#R83">83</a>]. As Huddy noted, till the 2000s, the approach of scholars on this topic was to combine
                                       anxiety, anger and other emotional responses as a unique reaction to threats. More
                                       recently, the literature has included anxiety as a response to threats undermining
                                       individual security or the security of people who are close in social relationship.
                                       At the same time, anger has been connected to the perception of threats towards the
                                       group to which the perceiver belongs or threats posed by events seen as unjust. According
                                       to recent literature, fear is generally one of the most common responses to the perception
                                       of threats to individual security, while anxiety characterizes specific clinical and
                                       sub-clinical conditions. However, it is interesting to note how fear and anxiety share
                                       some biological underpinnings. For example, both of them have been associated with
                                       activity in the hypothalamus and midbrain periaqueductal regions [<a href="#R84">84</a>]. Huddy highlighted how anxiety and anger show different patterns of effects on the
                                       processing of stimuli: anxiety is characterized by higher vigilance and augmented
                                       sensitivity to threats while anger is connoted by a more superficial analysis of the
                                       stimuli and risk-orientated decisions and behaviours [<a href="#R72">72</a>]. These varied responses may partly explain the different behavioural outcomes of
                                       threat perception mentioned before: fear of a threat is more likely to induce people
                                       to endorse and vote for more conservative security policies. At the same time, anger
                                       probably encourages people to support more aggressive policies and more authoritarian
                                       leaders. This occurrence could have important implications for the political sector.
                                       In particular, if the objective of politicians is to receive public support for policies
                                       which in ordinary times might be seen as aggressive, they might try to make citizens
                                       feel angry towards the source of the threat the nation has to face. Otherwise, citizens
                                       could feel afraid that their response might be in total contrast to what politicians
                                       aim to achieve.

                                    <p id="d1e595">There could be noteworthy implications of different affective responses to foreign
                                       policies. For example, anger is likely to make people see possible aggression toward
                                       identified enemies as more acceptable. However, a topic that has not been fully explored
                                       and that is relevant for national security strategies is how the emotional processing
                                       of threats modulates acceptance or opposition to homeland security policies. Some
                                       research provided insightful evidence of differential responses [<a href="#R52">52</a>]. Still, from both a scientific and practical application perspective, it would be
                                       interesting to investigate which emotions are involved, and to what extent they come
                                       into play when dealing with threats towards the individual or the nation, and how
                                       they direct behaviours as opposing or endorsing homeland security controls. Such an
                                       investigation would be coherent with the theory of securitization presented earlier,
                                       which stresses the importance of the societal sector not only for international relations
                                       but even within a single nation. Another element in common with the securitization
                                       theory concerns national identity. As explained in previous sections, national identity
                                       can be considered a referent object and, therefore, something that must be securitized.
                                       Moreover, it seems that higher levels of anger are perceived by those people who have
                                       a strong sense of national identity [<a href="#R72">72</a>]. Consequently, investigating the level of national identity among citizens might
                                       provide useful information on how they react to threats to national security.

                              <p id="d1e606">This article presented the fundamental theoretical shift in security studies in the
                                 last fifty years: the focus of investigation passed from an analysis encompassing
                                 almost uniquely military aspects to a broader focus, one that comprised new elements
                                 of security, such as new security actors, new security sectors and new securitizing
                                 objects. This shift has elevated social actors such as citizens to the status of security
                                 actors. In this respect, the Copenhagen School of security studies elaborated an innovative
                                 theory according to which citizens could be identified as referent objects, securitizing
                                 actors, and functional actors. In fact, they concurrently are recipients of security
                                 measures, security stakeholders [<a href="#R25">25</a>] and part of the society capable of influencing decisions in the field of security.
                                 More recently, citizens’ perceptions of issues related to national security began
                                 to be systematically investigated. Since the beginning of the 21<span class="inline-formula">

                                 of security studies.

                              <p id="d1e627">The element of novelty of the present research resides in the analysis of the literature
                                 on citizens’ perceptions of issues related to national security studies over the last
                                 few decades. The main conclusion of such an analysis is that citizens’ perceptions
                                 of security issues have become a crucial topic within the security studies literature.
                                 Although this stream of research has received a great deal of attention in the last
                                 few decades, this paper pointed out that several areas of enquiry still need to be
                                 systematically covered by academic research. One emblematic example of this areas
                                 is the emotional responses of citizens to national security threats. The analysis
                                 of this topic might have direct effects on the implementation or termination of measures
                                 aimed at protecting national security (e.g. TIA).

                              <p id="d1e629">Moreover, the analysis of citizens’ perceptions of security issues may elucidate a
                                 rather unexplored area of investigation: the relationship between intelligence services
                                 and citizens. By exploring this topic, issues such as citizens’ trust in intelligence
                                 services, attitudes towards intelligence operations and the effects of historical
                                 and cultural elements on citizens’ perceptions of intelligence issues may be systematically
                                 investigated. Recent influential research highlighted that citizens’ can be considered
                                 beneficiaries, producers and generally actors of intelligence [<a href="#R85">85</a>]. In addition, citizens’ perceptions, opinions, attitudes and behaviours represent
                                 elements of the idea of intelligence culture [<a href="#R86">86</a>]. Thus, the analysis of citizens’ perceptions can be a crucial topic even in the
                                 intelligence studies literature.
                                 Overall, the analysis of citizens’ perception of security issues may shed light on
                                 urgent matters such as the public acceptance or opposition to measures aimed at protecting
                                 national security, the attitudes towards intelligence services and the psychological
                                 and behavioural antecedents and consequences of national security incidents.
