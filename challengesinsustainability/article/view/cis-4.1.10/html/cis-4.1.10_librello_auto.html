                                 such as farming within the city, in its interstitial areas and wastelands? In this
                                 perspective, urban agriculture becomes a common good, bringing people together and
                                 reshaping the whole urban fabric that would eventually propose a radical remaking
                                 of the urban. Urban agriculture lends particularly well to long-lasting urban policies,
                                 especially those turning environmental “bads”—such as brownfields and wastelands—into
                                 environmental “goods” and urban amenities. Urban agriculture in interstitial abandoned
                                 urban areas may be one of cities’ main seedbeds of creative innovation. It is all

                              <p id="d1e81">Traditionally, sustainable urbanization is identified with the historical model of
                                 European cities, with their dense centers and their suburbs, while low density cities
                                 are usually associated with soil squandering and heavy traffic—when taking one’s car
                                 is the only solution to move from one place to another [<a href="#R01">1</a>]. Thus, the compact city is often perceived as a universal model for urban transition
                                 to sustainability [<a href="#R02">2</a>]. Even more so given the fact that urban sustainability is generally discussed in
                                 the light of making a better use of what already exists, which is well in line with
                                 the spatial dynamics of a compact city: Recycling the urban fabric and the urban functions
                                 without going through phases of obsolescence and degraded neighborhoods [<a href="#R03">3</a>, <a href="#R04">4</a>]. But this view is becoming controversial for at least three reasons. First, high
                                 densities also generate huge environmental nuisances and constraints [<a href="#R05">5</a>], and besides climate policies introduce arguments for considering positively lower-density
                                 urbanization: For example, green neighborhoods planted with trees presenting a high
                                 water loss coefficient can lower the local temperature (10% of vegetation increase
                                 lowers the temperature as much as 1<span class="inline-formula">

                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e111">Second, establishing a compact city may prove impracticable in the long run because
                                 it goes against market preferences and people’s desires for individual housing [<a href="#R07">7</a>, <a href="#R08">8</a>]. We must admit that whatever huge efforts were made by public authorities wherever
                                 in the world over more than fifty years to limit urban sprawl, they failed [<a href="#R09">9</a>, <a href="#R10">10</a>, <a href="#R11">11</a>]: Sprawl has become the usual mode of production of the contemporary city, whatever
                                 its size, its administrative configuration or its policies [<a href="#R12">12</a>, <a href="#R13">13</a>]. Even “shrinking cities” and those facing decline and abandonment, have to deal
                                 with fragmentation and urban sprawl [<a href="#R14">14</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e138">Third, many aspects of urban sustainability cannot be addressed within the limits
                                 of the compact city. For example, any city—be it sustainable or not—has to provide
                                 water and energy to its inhabitants, while reducing pollution and processing all the
                                 urban waste [<a href="#R15">15</a>]. Beyond all the well-known technical solutions—smart grids, selective sorting, urban
                                 heating, wastewater treatment plants, intelligent buildings, etc.—the energy, the
                                 resources, the water and the food still come from outside the city limits. Sewage
                                 plants and garbage dumps are also outside. Even a large number of the people that
                                 work in the city live outside, when they cannot afford the expensive—and sometimes
                                 gentrified—urban centers [<a href="#R16">16</a>, <a href="#R17">17</a>]. When a place looks sustainable by giving to other places the burden of its sustainability—exporting
                                 pollution and polluting activities, while siphoning resources—this place is not really
                                 sustainable. It benefits from what David Pearce calls imported sustainability [<a href="#R18">18</a>], which is a major bias against the implementation of sustainability policies.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e152">Thus, it is impossible to address urban sustainability by considering only urban centers.
                                 It is crucial to design sustainability across areas large enough to include most of
                                 the fluxes of the urban metabolism, which means areas encompassing suburban, periurban,
                                 and dependent rural or natural places [<a href="#R19">19</a>]. As a matter of fact, the social, economic, scientific, technical and cultural transformations
                                 of the last few decades have produced deep changes in how society relates to space.
                                 Today, urban areas have either no boundaries or very fuzzy ones, as showed by Bernardo
                                 Secchi [<a href="#R20">20</a>, <a href="#R21">21</a>] with the notion of <i>Citta Diffusa</i> or by Thomas Sieverts [<a href="#R22">22</a>] with the notion of <i>Zwichenstadt</i>. Why on earth are we supposed to set up a false dichotomy between urban and rural
                                 area, given that lifestyle, facilities and amenities are not so different? It is much
                                 more consistent to start addressing a whole “urban region” when considering urban
                                 transition to sustainability as shown by the European project PLUREL [<a href="#R23">23</a>, <a href="#R24">24</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e179">How to address sustainability across the urban-rural continuum—suburban, periurban,
                                 and dependent rural or natural areas—, considering (i) that urban sprawl has proven
                                 very difficult to stop (if not impossible), and (ii) that distinguishing between rural
                                 life and urban life makes no real sense anymore?
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e181">Since lower-density urbanization offers some advantages as far as sustainability is
                                 concerned and is no more considered an absolute evil, why not counteract urban sprawl
                                 by fostering what could be called “rural sprawl”, by introducing nature and rural
                                 characteristics such as farming within the city—within its interstitial areas and
                                 wastelands? After all, low-density urbanization was once the rule than the exception
                                 for centuries all around the world [<a href="#R25">25</a>]: In villages and hamlets, small communities had a very dynamic social life in a
                                 nice environment. Such a position postulates that urban agriculture might be the source

                                 systems while contributing to a more sustainable future. But what do we really call

                              <p id="d1e189">Basically, urban agriculture is the practice of cultivating, processing, and distributing
                                 food in or around a village, town, or city [<a href="#R26">26</a>]. This notwithstanding, there are very different types of urban agriculture that
                                 don’t have much in common except that they consist of growing edible plants in the
                                 city: Intensive vertical farming, micro-farming, kitchen and community gardens, etc.

                              <p id="d1e194">Thus, are we speaking of the new farming architectures that have been proliferating
                                 since the nineties in the wake of the Smart Cities movement, such as Vertical Farming—cultivating
                                 plants or breeding animals within tall greenhouse buildings or vertically inclined
                                 surfaces [<a href="#R27">27</a>]—epitomized by the mainstream medias as the paragon of urban agriculture? Vertical
                                 farming takes form in several ways [<a href="#R28">28</a>]: Crops being grown in the interior floors of midrise buildings with apparatuses
                                 that rotate crops on belts (http://www.verticalfarm.com/), rooftop farming, tree-like
                                 skyscrapers (http://agritecture.com/). The point of this farming laden with eco-technologies
                                 is exploiting synergies between the built environment and intensive—if not industrial—agriculture
                                 [<a href="#R29">29</a>]: Recirculating hydroponics and aeroponics that significantly reduce the amount of
                                 water needed, collecting rain and treating wastewater, producing photovoltaic green
                                 energy, etc. [<a href="#R30">30</a>].

                              <p id="d1e208">It was Dickson Despommier who started using the term “vertical farming” in 1999, first
                                 to qualify the cultivation of plants on flat roofs, and then inside retrofitted empty
                                 mid-rise buildings [<a href="#R31">31</a>]. But his vision of a vertical farm was that of “a neighborhood concept couched in
                                 futuristic terms, but with a homespun intent” [<a href="#R32">32</a>]. This is quite different from the brand-new smart buildings—tree-like skyscrapers
                                 and high-rise agritectures—proposed today as the be-all-and-end-all of urban agriculture,
                                 which eventually are projects that remain projects: None have ever been built, which
                                 says a lot about their feasibility. There are many huge problems inherent to this
                                 vertical farming:

                              <p id="d1e231">In real life, vertical farmers are far more modest, and much closer to Despommier’s
                                 intuition: A three-story building with solar panels on its roof in the South Korean
                                 city of Suwon; a three floors underground farm in the city of Den Bosch in the Netherlands,
                                 with plants cultivated without sunlight by a private company—PlantLab. And it is logical,
                                 since vertical farming is an old idea finally, that is not necessarily linked with
                                 Smart Cities, ecotechnology and big data. Indigenous people in South America have
                                 long used vertically layered growing techniques, and the rice terraces of East Asia
                                 follow the same principle; as did the hanging gardens of Babylon, thousands of years
                                 ago. And, by the way, it was Gilbert Ellis Bailey who first coined the term “vertical
                                 farming” in 1915, long before anybody heard about any smart-<i>whatsit</i> [<a href="#R34">34</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e239">As beautifully put by Stan Cox and David Van Tassel, recent vertical farming
                                 looks like a dreamy idea with a solid financial and political hidden agendas, which
                                 would ultimately become even more industrialized than modern rural agriculture [<a href="#R35">35</a>]. Indeed, to defend this type of urban farming many authors argue that fossil fuels,
                                 fertilizers, and government subsidies to industrial farming are also expensive [<a href="#R36">36</a>]. Doing so, they consider implicitly that vertical farming and industrial farming
                                 should be of the same nature and have the same standards. It says a lot about the
                                 financial interests and real objectives. Such a type of urban agriculture is all but
                                 sustainable, and can certainly not foster urban sustainability.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e247">Besides, there are many good reasons why high-rise buildings do not already have trees:
                                 It is hot or cold or windy or both, up there. Nearly every climate variable is more
                                 extreme than at street level. As mentioned by Tim De Chant: “If—and it’s a big if—any
                                 of these buildings ever get built, odds are they’ll be stripped of their foliage quicker
                                 than a developer can say ’return on investment”’ [<a href="#R37">37</a>]. Besides, what would be the economic and social cost to water and fertilize these
                                 trees? Concerning cattle, what would be the real productivity of such farms, when
                                 a single cow needs more than 1.5 ha of grassland in his life. And even vegetable crops
                                 grow better on natural soil than indoors or on roofs [<a href="#R38">38</a>]. There is obviously a huge discrepancy between the dream—or the nightmare—and the
                                 reality.

                              <p id="d1e255">The final point, which for me constitutes the first on the sustainability planning
                                 level, is: How the urban fabric may be inclusive of this type of farming? As highlighted
                                 by Saskia Sassen, in the broader perspective of the Smart Cities movement: “These
                                 technologies have not been sufficiently ‘urbanized’. That is, they have not been made
                                 to work within a particular urban context. It is not feasible simply to plop down
                                 a new technology in an urban space” [<a href="#R39">39</a>]. Focusing on these agritectures may lead to ignoring promising alternatives of urban
                                 development [<a href="#R40">40</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e263">Eco-technologies are not an end in themselves, and may certainly not be considered
                                 sustainable by nature: A hammer can be used indifferently to knock in nails or to
                                 shatter skulls, but the hammer is neither bad nor good. It is the person that uses
                                 it who decides. The same goes for eco-technologies. Never underestimate the negative
                                 effects of the new technological and networked infrastructures needed for a city to
                                 be smart [<a href="#R41">41</a>]. Thus, the success of sustainability policies depends on their objectives and their
                                 local ownership by the people concerned [<a href="#R42">42</a>]: An issue too often dodged by the designers of smart-agritectures. When trying to
                                 determine if urban agriculture may contribute to a sustainable future, the primary
                                 question to ask is: Will this agriculture be at the service of the inhabitants—and
                                 not the other way around. Indeed, it is crucial to keep in mind that the “environment”,
                                 far from being pure transcendence, is embedded in societies, as demonstrated by Maarten
                                 Hajer [<a href="#R43">43</a>, <a href="#R44">44</a>]. In a former article for <i>Challenges in Sustainability</i> I explained how the human being builds a representation of the ecosystems he lives
                                 in and calls it “environment” out of the usages he makes of its resources: takings
                                 (usage of air, water, minerals), inputs (pollution), alterations (housing, transport)
                                 [<a href="#R45">45</a>]. Thus to address urban sustainability, it is crucial to know what a “good environment”
                                 is for the people and the communities living there; one in which the enhancement of
                                 environmental conditions <i>stricto sensu</i> (water quality, air, biodiversity, prudent use of resources, land and energy, etc.)
                                 improves living conditions and facilitates new lifestyles. A polluted environment
                                 can be a place where life is good. Just think about the price of a square meter in
                                 the very center of the very noisy and very polluted Manhattan, Paris or London. Conversely,
                                 an environment with clean air and clean water can be quite intolerable as evidenced
                                 by windswept, segregated social-housing blocks settled in the middle of nowhere.

                              <p id="d1e290">All of the above leads us to consider that to design a more sustainable future in
                                 the rural-urban continuum we should rather focus on a more traditional type of urban
                                 agriculture that gives consistency to the whole urban fabric. That is to say an urban
                                 agriculture made of community gardens, kitchen gardens, crofting and micro-farming,
                                 land sharing, low-rise rooftop gardens or schoolyard greenhouses—which are different
                                 things but strongly linked to each other because they develop the potential for people
                                 to exercise significant influence over the place where they live [<a href="#R46">46</a>, <a href="#R47">47</a>]. The point is longer-lasting change, in the spirit of Rob Hopkins’ <i>Transition Towns</i> [<a href="#R48">48</a>, <a href="#R49">49</a>]. Tim Beatley’s <i>Green Urbanism</i> also resonates with the type of urban agriculture we contemplate in this paper. <i>Green Urbanism</i> identifies six issues by which a city complies with urban sustainability all of which
                                 may apply to community and kitchen gardens, as well as crofting: The city should be
                                 (i) living within its ecological limits, (ii) functioning in ways analogous to nature,
                                 (iii) striving to achieve a circular rather than a linear metabolism, (iv) striving
                                 toward local self-sufficiency, (v) facilitating more sustainable lifestyles, and (vi)
                                 last but not least emphasizing neighborhood and community life [<a href="#R50">50</a>, <a href="#R51">51</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e320">This urban agriculture varies a lot according to the climate, and the economic and
                                 social situation of the city. In many urban areas of Central and South America, Africa
                                 or South East Asia, urban agriculture is essentially a food security issue, related
                                 to the fight against poverty and malnutrition [<a href="#R52">52</a>, <a href="#R52">52</a>, <a href="#R53">53</a>]. The situation is quite different in European cities [<a href="#R54">54</a>], North American cities [<a href="#R55">55</a>], or Japanese cities [<a href="#R56">56</a>]. In these regions, many official urban agricultural projects result from “greening”
                                 agendas created under the umbrella of the <i>Green New Deal</i>, which aims to address global warming and the financial crises rather than food issues
                                 as mentioned by Tim Jackson [<a href="#R57">57</a>]. In most other cities, the landscaping aspect and the recreational dimension are
                                 highlighted. In all these cases, urban agriculture is mainly seen as a social innovation
                                 that improves the quality of life, fosters social links among neighbors, and enhances
                                 urban landscapes. In so-called “Northern” cities urban agriculture is not so much
                                 about food, really [<a href="#R58">58</a>]. In any event, all these urban agricultures—whatever their form, their goal and
                                 their means—share significantly common features: The size and shape of the field plots,
                                 the informality, the ability to create or foster neighborhoods relations, etc. [<a href="#R59">59</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e353">Their common features result from the fact that all these agricultures have been in
                                 the cities—where they met the same needs and fulfilled the same purposes—since time
                                 immemorial. Urban agriculture is not such a fresh idea. Moreover, it is certainly
                                 not an offspring of sustainable development. Urban agriculture existed for centuries
                                 in very different places around the world, such as the <i>chinampas</i> in Tenochtitlan—the actual Mexico city—since the 15th century or sooner [<a href="#R60">60</a>], the <i>hortillonnages</i> in Amiens—a French city north of Paris—for more than twenty centuries [<a href="#R61">61</a>], or the interstitial gardens (<i>agriculture d’interstice</i>) in Yaoundé—Cameroon’s capital—where they accompanied the foundation of the city
                                 in the 19th century [<a href="#R62">62</a>].

                              <p id="d1e374">Urbanization has gone hand-in-hand with agriculture from the beginning, as matter
                                 of fact since the Neolithic period [<a href="#R63">63</a>]. Agricultural activities have been crucial to the foundation of new colonies since
                                 Greek and Roman ages [<a href="#R64">64</a>]. Even in medieval times when walls and defensive structures left out most of the
                                 farmland, agricultural patches were available inside the city and next to the city
                                 walls [<a href="#R65">65</a>, <a href="#R66">66</a>]. Jane Jacobs even assumes that agriculture was initially within human settlements
                                 that could be called primitive urban places, and migrated to the countryside only
                                 later [<a href="#R67">67</a>].

                              <p id="d1e391">But while cities and agriculture have long been inseparable and mutually reinforcing,
                                 everything changed during the twentieth century: Increased mobility and progressive
                                 globalization made pointless the previous need for geographical proximity between
                                 the farmers and the urban consumers. Farming was then more or less banned from the
                                 city under the combined forces of urban densification and planning regulation [<a href="#R68">68</a>]. This period could be qualified as the great rupture.

                              <p id="d1e396">The new craze for the form of urban agriculture that we are dealing with in this paper
                                 began 20 years ago. It renewed—but also transformed deeply—the old tradition of nineteenth
                                 century backyard gardens that existed before the great rupture. Beyond traditional
                                 allotment gardening, urban agriculture appeared in front lawns, kitchen gardens, pavement
                                 verges, railway embankments and any interstitial spaces, which is more unusual. In
                                 many ways, the citizens involved in this type of urban agriculture claimed ownership
                                 over the city, and particularly over the policies and projects developed by the city
                                 [<a href="#R69">69</a>].

                              <p id="d1e401">It means that the relation between urban agriculture and the sustainable city is not
                                 just a matter of food or greening, it is also about inclusiveness and ownership. One
                                 among the many challenges of urban sustainability is reestablishing the inclusiveness
                                 of the urban fabric instead of just popping-up parks, green spaces or smart-buildings.

                                 to become suddenly sustainable. Shocking but understandable: mayors, representatives
                                 and more generally elected officials adore showcasing actions that are very visible.
                                 They are less interested in citizen ownership and holistic approaches, which are more
                                 important to make the city sustainable but harder to implement and less profitable
                                 as an electoral issue. Besides, French <i>espaces verts</i> (green spaces) do not necessarily bring people together. They may also be used to
                                 separate, in line with the Parisian history: The introduction of greenery by Haussmann
                                 was an attempt to control the use of public space by a technical approach [<a href="#R70">70</a>]: “…by losing its name, the old park is deprived of its positive attributes… the
                                 espace vert is no longer a place but rather an indistinct area whose boundaries are
                                 decided in the abstract world of the master plans…” [<a href="#R71">71</a>].

                              <p id="d1e421">All things considered, when trying to make a city sustainable, there may be some good
                                 sense in promoting urban agriculture instead of manicured sophisticated green areas.
                                 In this perspective urban agriculture would propose a radical remaking of the urban
                                 [<a href="#R72">72</a>], which breaks with the urban-rural dichotomy. This option paves the way to a reinvention
                                 of the urban form and its management through new lifestyles and through the reconstruction
                                 of some kind of urban commons [<a href="#R73">73</a>, <a href="#R74">74</a>]. Such an urban agriculture should be considered as a common good, bringing people
                                 together and reshaping the whole urban fabric.

                              <p id="d1e432">Is it really doable? Has it already been done, and if so where and how? In all the
                                 historical examples given before—<i>hortillonnages, chinampas, agriculture d’interstice,</i> etc.—as well as in recent cases where urban citizens and gardeners gain ownership
                                 of the city, it appears that urban agriculture “works better” when no public or private
                                 actor explains to the population what the procedure should be and how people should
                                 act. To say it otherwise, it looks like urban agriculture “works better” when nobody
                                 looks: That is when the inhabitants first transform their living environment outside
                                 of any legal framework or official urban project, and their actions are only integrated
                                 afterwards into urban planning or urban policies. In France, the <i>Trames Vertes et Bleues</i> (Green and Blue Grids) are a perfect example of what not to do. These Trames are
                                 land management tools dedicated to the preservation of biodiversity—especially in
                                 urban and periurban areas—created in the aftermath of the <i>Grenelle de l’Environnement</i> [<a href="#R75">75</a>], after 2007 [<a href="#R76">76</a>]. The procedure was way too formal and technocratic to succeed in the constitution
                                 of a true regional <i>Trame Verte</i> [<a href="#R77">77</a>]. Nobody asked the local communities and the inhabitants for their views. Thus, in
                                 many places the implementation of the Trames turned confrontational, and resulted
                                 finally in inconsistent and incomplete grids [<a href="#R78">78</a>].

                              <p id="d1e459">On the other hand, the remarkable history of La Fournillière shows how a squatted
                                 wasteland in a poor place near social housing blocks turned into a very popular park
                                 based on urban agriculture. The inhabitants created this place by themselves, seeking
                                 their own objectives. In the end, the local authorities had no choice but to enact
                                 their initiative and legalize it, re-commoning urban land through agriculture.

                              <p id="d1e464">To understand what happened at La Fournillière it is necessary first to apprehend
                                 the historical context. The place was a village—annexed to the French city of Nantes
                                 in 1908—that became an industrial suburb with fruit and vegetable canneries (Figure
                                 <a href="#Fig01">1</a>). A rich soil that allows cultivation of field peas, baby carrots, or asparagus,
                                 explains why the canneries settled there. These companies provided kitchen gardens
                                 to their employees within the policy framework of industrial paternalism. During the
                                 post-war boom major changes took place: Social housing complexes were built and successive
                                 projects were developed on the site of these kitchen gardens. The first one was an
                                 access highway to downtown Nantes. The gardeners were evicted and their gardens ceased
                                 to exist. This first project was finally abandoned. Others projects followed but they
                                 failed to become effective due to local political turmoil. Finally, nothing happened
                                 and in the seventies the place turned into wasteland of more than 3 hectares [<a href="#R79">79</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e472">The people living nearby—especially those from the social housing blocks who didn’t
                                 have access to nature—started eyeing this abandoned land and its rich soil with interest
                                 (Figure <a href="#Fig02">2</a>). From the mid-seventies—one after the other—they progressively occupied La Fournillière,
                                 first at night and finally in broad daylight. By the end of the nineties, there were
                                 more than 70 squatting gardeners there. As mentioned by Elisabeth Pasquier, to get
                                 a piece of land there you simply had to start digging the ground somewhere—a corner
                                 that looks vacant—and wait. If nobody were coming at you, you could keep digging and
                                 start tending your future garden. A few days more, or a week, without any hostility
                                 from your neighbors meant that this piece of land was ostensibly yours. You could
                                 than start fencing, sowing, and socializing with your neighbors [<a href="#R80">80</a>]. At the end, two categories of squatting gardeners worked a piece of land at La
                                 Fournillière [<a href="#R81">81</a>].

                              <p id="d1e483">On the one side, some of the former evicted gardeners—or their children—came back.
                                 They were locals, most of them descended from Brittany or Vendée (two French regions).
                                 They were few. They stuck together and kept closely connected via common emblematic
                                 activities, such as <i>pétanque</i> (bocce tournament), <i>apéritif</i> (before-dinner drinks) or barbecues. This category of gardeners was made of poor
                                 but not marginalized people. They lived in substandard one-family houses. There were
                                 usually old people with a small retirement pension or younger poor workers; they knew
                                 how to cultivate a small piece of land.

                                 disadvantaged social housing complexes around La Fournillière. They had different
                                 origins and ethnic background, being mainly North Africans. Many among them were unemployed
                                 and lived on social benefits. For them, ”owning” a piece of land at La Fournillière
                                 was a way of keeping active, and it was a place where they could settle symbolically—a
                                 “circulatory space” (<i>territoire circulatoire</i>), within the meaning of Alain Tarrius—, a place where they could grow roots, literally
                                 [<a href="#R82">82</a>]. These gardeners were called “<i>les autres</i>” (the others) by the local gardeners from the first category, but they represented
                                 an overwhelming majority with nearly 4 gardeners out of 5.

                              <p id="d1e516">Both groups tended to ignore each other, but an element of solidarity brings them
                                 together: They were all fully aware of how precarious and uncertain their future in
                                 La Fournillière was. As squatters, they could be expelled at any time. They all knew
                                 they had to stand united to respond effectively to any of the many menaces that might
                                 threaten their plot—a new urban project, theft and vandalism from the people outside,
                                 etc. Such a situation fosters social links.

                                 again in La Fournillière. This time the new project was a neighborhood park. Something
                                 unusual happened then. The two groups of gardeners started uniting their forces and
                                 organizing to impose their views on the project. They also knew that the game of illegally
                                 occupying pieces of land couldn’t go on forever. It was time for them to make their
                                 situation legal, preferably on their own terms. A form of collective intelligence
                                 emerged, and with it the seeds of a collective identity [<a href="#R83">83</a>].

                              <p id="d1e523">Rather than making demands and organizing protests, they decided to draw out an in-depth
                                 report on the actual situation at La Fournillière, providing an exact overview plus
                                 maps of the different pieces of land, including the spatial pattern of the different
                                 gardens and their history. The report displayed the long work of clearing and planting
                                 that they had done as well as the public goods they had created. It illustrated the
                                 social and ecological value of these gardens for the whole city. The gardeners demonstrated
                                 that La Fournillière was a well of common good as it was, whereas the project developed
                                 by the municipality could very well fail and destroy the whole site unless they took
                                 into account their own experiences and the actual organization of La Fournillière.
                                 Finally, they claimed that they wanted to be decision-making partners in the project
                                 and have a seat at the decision-making table.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e525">The planners of the city of Nantes understood that the opposition of the gardeners
                                 was not a negative NIMBY reaction but the expression of collective wills and skills
                                 [<a href="#R84">84</a>]. Once they realized that an alternative proposal with strong local community (and
                                 therefore, electors) support was emerging, they agreed to discuss with the gardener’s
                                 collective. At the end of a long process of negotiations—and against all odds—the
                                 city council decided to support the gardeners’ alternative project and to abandon
                                 its own proposal. The new project envisioned a park organized around the existing
                                 gardens, forming islets or patches. Paths for walkers and runners entwined with the
                                 islets, connecting them. At the very center of the park a venue was placed to initiate
                                 visitors to the recycling of material and waste in urban gardening, including waste
                                 sorting and composting to enhance biomass and biodiversity. The gardeners determined
                                 themselves the rules for living together: More frugal and wiser water-management;
                                 a ban on cutting any tree in one’s own gardens, since trees are considered to be common
                                 goods etc. [<a href="#R85">85</a>]. In some sense, the case of La Fournillière is prototypical of Alberto Magnaghi’s
                                 idea of combining both bottom up and top down processes of decision-making in the
                                 urbanization process [<a href="#R86">86</a>].

                              <p id="d1e537">Today, La Fournillière is a particularly charming and unusually large urban farming
                                 land that one can only reach by walking. Two narrow lanes lead to a kind of huge clearing
                                 covered by gardens, scattered trees, and bushes (Figure <a href="#Fig03">3</a>). Large colored water tanks surround shacks made out of recycled materials gathered
                                 in small patches. A maze of service alleys spreads around five key items: three wells,
                                 a pond, and an improvised <i>pétanque</i> court. La Fournillière is also a social theater. These kitchen gardens give grown-ups
                                 a place where they can get away from it all and become kids again: a parenthesis in
                                 their ordinary lives since at the end of the day they go back home. They indulge themselves
                                 by putting things in the garden that wouldn’t be permitted anywhere else in the city:
                                 a doll’s head impaled on a pole, a teddy bear crucified on a picket fence, etc. Apart
                                 from the magic of the place, they are also kitchen gardens and also have, as such,
                                 straightforward economic interests: cabbages, potatoes, and other vegetables are planted
                                 to feed the family year-round. Two larger paths cross the whole area. They were created
                                 by the footsteps of thousands of people. Placed in the middle of the city, traversing
                                 La Fournillière is a shortcut for many men and women going to school, to work, or
                                 simply to the market in Nantes.

                              <p id="d1e548">As I discussed in a recent paper a city does not arise from the sole will and skill
                                 of architects, planners, surveyors, and politicians [<a href="#R78">78</a>]. It has to be nurtured and molded by its inhabitants to bring it to life. Such a
                                 process needs time, quite differently from the frenetic timeline and knee-jerk reactions
                                 to any opposition that elected officials and planners, guided by their own short-term
                                 interests impose on urban policies (the next election, compliance with construction
                                 deadlines etc.).
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e553">Urban agriculture lends particularly well to long-lasting urban policies, especially
                                 those turning environmental “bads”—such as brownfields and wastelands—into environmental
                                 goods and urban amenities. Naturally, it will not be possible everywhere. There are
                                 also health issues when redeveloping brownfields for urban agriculture, due to potentially
                                 polluted groundwater and soils. Nonetheless, it would make sense to establish productive
                                 lands as a key component of urban design when possible, as proposed by Andre Viljoen
                                 and Joe Howe [<a href="#R87">87</a>]. A network of agricultural plots, which would penetrate the smallest nooks and crannies
                                 of the urban fabric, should be a wonderful tool to link the different components of
                                 the city, while providing other ecosystem services such as walking and leisure activities.
                                 Besides, such a network would greatly improve urban resilience, by linking formerly
                                 scattered vegetated places within a consistent system. Squares, parks, gardens—community
                                 gardens and kitchen gardens, as well as public gardens—and more generally all vegetated
                                 urban public spaces will be connected by urban agriculture.

                              <p id="d1e565">In this perspective, urban agriculture embodies the proper use of slowness (Le bon
                                 usage de la lenteur) in urban planning and design as depicted by Pierre Sansot [<a href="#R88">88</a>]. And the history of La Fournillière illustrates it perfectly: Had only one of the
                                 successive lunatic projects designed in the seventies been built, these gardens would
                                 have never existed. It is also a symbol of what can be done when everybody is involved
                                 in the planning procedures, which means sitting everyone at the table so that all
                                 the inhabitants understand that the urban affairs are also their affairs. This urban
                                 agriculture is about the right to decide and the power to create, renewing and deepening
                                 what Henri Lefebvre called <i>Le Droit à la Ville</i> (The Right to the City) [<a href="#R89">89</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e576">As a general rule, urban transitions to sustainability—to which these urban agricultures
                                 relate—require involving every citizen in the decision that affect them, and especially
                                 in the designing of the urban projects—and not only by “consulting” them. The more
                                 top-down repairing planning procedures the less results, if not linked with grassroots
                                 collaborative process and with negotiation between local communities and local authorities
                                 [<a href="#R90">90</a>]. Grasping what happened at La Fournillière eventually means deciphering the eternal
                                 game between what the authorities—whatever their form—try to impose on the social
                                 fabric, and what the social fabric—represented by the gardeners—impose on the authorities,
                                 through deception or force, through confrontation or bargaining. It is all about how
                                 people take ownership over their own city. In this way, urban agriculture can really
                                 be the cornerstone that helps reconfigure urban areas, and the backbone of a new and
                                 more sustainable urban arrangement to foster urban transition to sustainability.
