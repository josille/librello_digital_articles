                                 (TMNs) in governing sustainable development. As associations, one key task of TMNs
                                 is to represent their members through production and dissemination of information
                                 and knowledge concerning municipal action for sustainable development. Case studies,
                                 often emphasising best practice, are used by many TMNs to fulfil this task. Nevertheless,
                                 despite strong scrutiny concerning the use of case studies in “policy mobilities”
                                 research, there have been limited attempts to quantify the ways in which TMNs present
                                 and disseminate case studies and, by doing so, generate trends of presence and absence
                                 in literature on sustainable development. Assessing patterns of representation for
                                 continents, countries, municipalities and themes across nine international case study
                                 collections published by ICLEI - Local Governments for Sustainability since 1991,
                                 this study responds to this research gap and identifies the presence of “usual suspects”
                                 in the ICLEI case study collections, along with notable absentees. By doing so, the
                                 study contributes to policy mobilities research and literature on TMNs, by encouraging
                                 reflection and further research concerning the representation patterns influencing
                                 which municipalities and what topics are presented in discourses on sustainable development.</span></div>

                              <p id="d1e104">This paper explores the role of transnational municipal networks (TMNs) in governing
                                 for sustainable development, with specific focus on the production and dissemination
                                 of information and knowledge concerning municipal efforts to increase sustainability.
                                 Municipalities, it is claimed, play an important role in a transition to sustainable
                                 development that requires multi-level governance and diverse forms of action [<a href="#R01">1</a>, <a href="#R02">2</a>, <a href="#R03">3</a>]. As such, municipalities have initiated a diverse range of experiments aiming to
                                 contribute to sustainable development at the local and global level [<a href="#R04">4</a>, <a href="#R05">5</a>]. Various TMNs have been established to provide coordination and support functions
                                 that may add value to, and help spread knowledge about, the actions of single municipalities
                                 [<a href="#R06">6</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e125">TMNs are typically associations, organised as networks of members who may pay subscription
                                 fees and usually receive services in a variety of forms [<a href="#R07">7</a>]. TMNs may address multiple themes or single issues, be formed of particular types
                                 of municipality, or represent different geographic areas [<a href="#R08">8</a>, <a href="#R09">9</a>]. As such, it is difficult to directly compare TMNs [<a href="#R10">10</a>]. ICLEI - Local Governments for Sustainability (commonly known as ICLEI, and formerly
                                 known as the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives) has, since
                                 its foundation in 1990, emerged as a prominent TMN addressing sustainable development
                                 [<a href="#R11">11</a>, <a href="#R12">12</a>, <a href="#R13">13</a>].
                                 
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e149">ICLEI provides a range of information services aimed at members, stakeholders and
                                 the general public. This paper focuses on ICLEI’s use of case studies as an information
                                 tool, assessing the continents, countries, municipalities and themes represented in
                                 nine collections of case studies. The paper identifies patterns of representation
                                 across these collections and assesses ways in which the composition of the case study
                                 collections (i.e. the representation of certain types of activities in particular
                                 locations) may influence the framing of the practice and study of sustainable development
                                 in municipalities, and the possible implications of such representation for research
                                 and practice [<a href="#R14">14</a>]. By doing so, this paper contributes to literature considering the role of materials
                                 (e.g. publications) in “policy mobilities” [<a href="#R15">15</a>, <a href="#R16">16</a>].

                              <p id="d1e163">TMNs are said to help municipalities address local, national and transnational concerns
                                 by providing services that fulfil local (intra-municipal), horizontal (inter-municipal)
                                 and vertical functions (national, international) [<a href="#R17">17</a>, <a href="#R18">18</a>]. Kern and Bulkeley [<a href="#R12">12</a>] identify three main characteristics of TMNs: 1) voluntary membership; 2) self-governing
                                 polycentric and non-hierarchical structures; and, 3) provision of implementation support
                                 to members (as opposed to the lobbying of conventional non-governmental organisations
                                 (NGOs)). As such, TMNs often act as mediators and convenors, promoting “governance
                                 by diffusion” [<a href="#R05">5</a>, <a href="#R19">19</a>, <a href="#R20">20</a>]. TMNs may be seen as a dynamic alternative to traditional forms of government [<a href="#R08">8</a>] or as “quasi-governmental” actors representing conventional interests embedded in
                                 the international system [<a href="#R17">17</a>]. Giest and Howlett [<a href="#R21">21</a>] argue that TMNs function more effectively when working with the support of national
                                 governments and when focused on specific geographical regions (cf. [<a href="#R07">7</a>]).
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e196">This suggests that the <i>location</i> of TMN activities may be as relevant as the topics or themes that they address. Studies
                                 by Dolowitz et al. [<a href="#R22">22</a>] support this perspective and downplay the diffusion effects of TMNs, noting that
                                 the policy searches of municipalities tend not to be systematic but are more often
                                 based on convenience and geographic proximity. That said, <i>when</i> there is evidence of careful and comprehensive searches, diffusion (or at least learning)
                                 may be said to occur [<a href="#R23">23</a>]. In order to be representative of their members (and/or constituency group), TMNs
                                 thus face a challenge to accommodate the interests of both the typical and more ambitious
                                 municipalities, for whom different types of information and services may be relevant.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e210">Representing members and their interests is a sizeable challenge for TMNs. Various
                                 authors observe the over-representation of certain cities or categories of cities
                                 in literature on sustainable development and within TMNs [<a href="#R24">24</a>, <a href="#R25">25</a>, <a href="#R26">26</a>]. In some cases, this may lead to the development of “core-periphery” dynamics influencing
                                 the operations, activities and thematic focus of TMNs [<a href="#R01">1</a>, <a href="#R07">7</a>, <a href="#R08">8</a>]. On such occasions, prominent and active members may contribute to the consolidation
                                 or diffusion of particular norms, themes or solutions, or dominate the internal governance
                                 of TMNs. Given that TMN members only ever account for a fraction of their possible
                                 constituency, issues or perspectives relevant to the large group of non-members may
                                 be downplayed or silenced in TMN agendas (indeed, the non-representative nature of
                                 TMNs, and their overall significance, remains under scrutiny, see e.g. [<a href="#R27">27</a>]). TMNs should thus be careful to avoid representing only “the usual suspects” [<a href="#R08">8</a>, <a href="#R28">28</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e240">An overview of several theoretical frameworks proposed to describe the roles and functions
                                 of TMNs can be found in Table <a href="#Tab01">1</a>. One task that is common to these frameworks is the production and dissemination
                                 of information and knowledge, and specifically the communication of best practices
                                 aiming to facilitate learning for improved sustainability performance. Best or good
                                 practice has no clearly defined meaning, yet may be assumed to refer to Jänicke and
                                 Weidner’s definition of “success in comparative terms as best (or nearly best) achievement”
                                 and thus encompass pioneering, radical and incremental approaches in comparison to
                                 the status quo ([<a href="#R29">29</a>], pp. 14–15). Nevertheless, McCann and Ward write that “neither success nor failure
                                 is absolute. One does not make sense without the other” ([<a href="#R30">30</a>], p. 828). The absence of best practices, indeed the absence of a case, may reveal
                                 and legitimise “attempts to change and embed new policy models” ([<a href="#R30">30</a>], p. 829). There is thus a need to critically assess patterns of presence and absence
                                 and their implications in collections of materials such as case studies.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e254">Best practices may also play a role in vertical governance, demonstrating “what is
                                 possible” to national governments, and thereby becoming tools for the advocacy and
                                 lobbying efforts of TMNs. Similarly, some municipalities use TMNs as platforms when
                                 aiming to raise their profile for green place branding purposes [<a href="#R31">31</a>, <a href="#R32">32</a>], although this may not be the primary aim of all municipalities in such networks
                                 [<a href="#R33">33</a>]. Finally, best practice examples may enable benchmarking processes [<a href="#R34">34</a>, <a href="#R35">35</a>]. In this case best practice would contribute to the internal governance of TMNs
                                 and their rule setting processes, as well as learning in municipalities.

                              <p id="d1e360">Although the precise aims of TMNs when disseminating information may vary, various
                                 TMNs use case studies as an information tool (e.g. C40 Cities, Energie Cités, Eurocities)
                                 [<a href="#R38">38</a>]. The publication of case studies enables TMNs to fulfil multiple objectives, e.g.
                                 by sharing information between members and more broadly, to society. Such case studies
                                 may focus on general issues of relevance to sustainable development, or more specifically
                                 on activities linked to specific themes that in turn may be linked to associations’
                                 thematic priorities or financing; case studies may also promote members or be offered
                                 as an incentive to get non-members to join. Case studies thus act as a functional
                                 tool for awareness-raising, exchange of ideas and capacity-building. However, recent
                                 literature has highlighted a number of possible problems with the ways that case studies
                                 present concepts or information.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e365">For example, many case studies focus on a single action in a specific municipality
                                 addressing a single theme. This striation of “sustainable development” may risk making
                                 the concept appear geographically or thematically specific or limited, and thereby
                                 consolidate isolationist or elitist norms [<a href="#R26">26</a>, <a href="#R39">39</a>, <a href="#R40">40</a>]. For example, some writers (such as [<a href="#R41">41</a>, <a href="#R42">42</a>, <a href="#R43">43</a>, <a href="#R44">44</a>, <a href="#R45">45</a>]) note an imbalance in the presentation of “developed” and “developing” world narratives
                                 in academic literature, leading to over-representation of cases from Europe and North
                                 America. Similarly, McFarlane [<a href="#R24">24</a>] and Pierre [<a href="#R46">46</a>] suggest theories of urban governance developed in studies of North American and
                                 European cities dominate over alternatives. In other words, the frequency, framing
                                 and form of assessments used by academics may distort understanding of urban contexts
                                 and result in the presentation of frequently-occurring cases dubbed “usual suspects”
                                 [<a href="#R28">28</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e401">There are other potential problems with the use of case studies. For example, solutions
                                 proposed in some case studies may accentuate the problems identified in others [<a href="#R29">29</a>, <a href="#R34">34</a>, <a href="#R47">47</a>, <a href="#R48">48</a>] and context-specific analysis is often developed and presented with limited reference
                                 to the global challenges that stimulate local action; such lack of performativity
                                 means that analysis is frequently detached from, or devoid of, meaning [<a href="#R39">39</a>]. Comparison between cases may be difficult because, as even advocates of comparative
                                 urban research note, comparative analysis depends on “some degree of reductionism
                                 as a step in preparing empirical observations” ([<a href="#R46">46</a>], p. 447; cf. [<a href="#R14">14</a>]).
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e425">Others contend that case studies have limited utility, even when they provide interesting
                                 information, as the scope and format of case studies tends to limit the amount of
                                 information that can be provided. Even in a non-comparative format, complex issues,
                                 such as institutional, political, socio-economic or environmental dimensions, may
                                 be presented in an overly simplified manner, or even discounted by readers on the
                                 basis of assumptions about perceived relevance [<a href="#R22">22</a>]. Such perceptions have led to criticisms of municipalities as being “purposefully
                                 conservative” doing little more than that which they consider practical or convenient
                                 [<a href="#R35">35</a>, <a href="#R49">49</a>]. Whilst there are not necessarily clear alternatives to the use of case studies,
                                 McCann and Ward are among the authors stating the need to explore the implications
                                 of presence and absence in more detail [<a href="#R30">30</a>].
                                 
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e439">In sum, recent works suggests that the over-representation of case studies in academic
                                 literature on urban sustainability may contribute to an over-representation of certain
                                 kinds of municipalities, e.g. cities of a certain size or in certain locations—at
                                 the expense of others. Cities that are not represented, under-represented or less
                                 visibly active may thus be considered to be either “free riders” or “silenced” in
                                 debates on sustainable development. Against this background, this article focuses
                                 on the extent to which different continental regions, countries, municipalities and
                                 themes are represented in nine collections of international case studies published
                                 by ICLEI. In particular, the paper investigates a claim made in a major ICLEI publication.

                              <p id="d1e441">In 2012, ICLEI published the global review “Local Sustainability 2012: taking stock
                                 and moving forward” [<a href="#R50">50</a>]. As a complement to the review, a compendium of case studies, “Showcasing progress”,
                                 was also published. “Showcasing progress” included short versions of 14 case studies
                                 in the main ICLEI Case Study series. ICLEI was keen to stress that the featured case
                                 studies were “not the usual suspects”, suggesting their awareness that some case studies
                                 perhaps risk becoming too familiar, repetitive or informative due to their frequent
                                 appearance in collections [<a href="#R28">28</a>]. How well does ICLEI’s claim stand up? Did the compendium feature a new group of
                                 municipalities? Or did the “usual suspects” reappear? By illustrating patterns of
                                 representation, the article will explore if “usual suspects” exist in this report
                                 and across ICLEI’s collections of case studies, and consider the implications of such
                                 occurrences for both theory and practice.

                                    <p id="d1e455">In September 2015, ICLEI celebrated the 25th anniversary of its foundation. A short
                                       history of ICLEI follows (cf. [<a href="#R51">51</a>]). In 1989, 35 local government leaders from North America met and pledged to establish
                                       local regulations to phase out the use of ozone-depleting chemicals. At this meeting,
                                       “Larry Agran, Mayor of Irvine, California, USA and Jeb Brugmann imagined an agency
                                       that could coordinate local government responses to global environmental problems”
                                       [<a href="#R52">52</a>]. An international consultation with local government officials was held, and in
                                       September 1990, more than 200 local governments from 43 countries attended the World
                                       Congress of Local Governments for a Sustainable Future. The Congress concluded with
                                       foundation of the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI)
                                       and adoption of ICLEI Charter [<a href="#R52">52</a>].

                                    <p id="d1e466">Operations began in March 1991, with the basic organisational structure of ICLEI being
                                       established: ICLEI World Secretariat, hosted by the City of Toronto, Canada, and a
                                       European Secretariat in Freiburg, Germany, opened. This world-regional structure has
                                       developed over time and today, ICLEI maintains eight regional Secretariats and four
                                       national offices [<a href="#R53">53</a>]. ICLEI regions broadly correlate with the UN Geoscheme of regions and sub-regions,
                                       which is used for statistical purposes in the international system. Since 2010, ICLEI
                                       World Secretariat has been hosted by the City of Bonn, Germany, with six thematic
                                       centres located at offices around the world [<a href="#R54">54</a>]. The thematic centres partly reflect the widening and deepening of ICLEI’s mandate
                                       and activities over time, as did the formal change in the organisation’s name made
                                       in 2003, when ICLEI became ICLEI - Local Governments for Sustainability. Recent years
                                       have also seen an increase in ICLEI membership. In 2006, New Delhi became the 500th
                                       active ICLEI member, and by November 2008, membership doubled when Mumbai joined.
                                       There are presently around 1000 active members of ICLEI in over 80 countries.

                                    <p id="d1e477">ICLEI defines itself as having a triple role: as an association of municipalities,
                                       a movement of municipalities, and an agency for municipalities. In other words, ICLEI
                                       provides a forum for members to meet and represents its members in other arena (e.g.
                                       UNCSD, UNFCCC), whilst initiating and participating in actions to raise awareness
                                       or increase capacity of municipalities and other stakeholders. The broad and multi-dimensional
                                       role of ICLEI is realised through a variety of initiatives, including campaigns, projects,
                                       alliances and awareness-raising activities including conferences.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e479">For example, at the UN Conference on Environment and Development in 1992, ICLEI proposed
                                       the Local Agenda 21 initiative, which subsequently developed into a significant conceptual
                                       and practical tool for municipalities to frame and develop their work around environmental
                                       issues. Similarly, the Cities for Climate Protection Campaign (CCP), launched at the
                                       First Municipal Leaders Summit on Climate Change in 1993, subsequently developed into
                                       a significant reference point for municipal work on climate change [<a href="#R55">55</a>]. ICLEI also plays a central role in a number of other initiatives, such as the European
                                       Sustainable Cities and Towns Campaign, and the EcoMobility Alliance.

                                       international and national/regional in scope. The publication of case studies and
                                       promotion of particular practices suggests a willingness to influence other municipalities
                                       and promote replication (in appropriate contexts) of the described approach. Interest
                                       is generated by describing an approach that is considered singular or unique, innovative

                                       a project and its results; identifying lessons learned; and assessing the “replication

                                    <p id="d1e503">Case studies may represent the experiences of member municipalities or ICLEI initiatives
                                       to specific or general audiences; highlight specific themes or topics (advocacy);
                                       or support capacity-building by illustrating particular methods, ideas or processes.
                                       For example, the main ICLEI Case Study series, issued by ICLEI World Secretariat,

                                    <p id="d1e517">In early 2013, ICLEI launched a new global website (www.iclei.org). This replaced
                                       the previous website, which was archived at (http://archive.iclei.org). The archived
                                       website remains online, although many of the internal links no longer function. On
                                       the old website, ICLEI displayed its publications in the section “ICLEI Publications”.
                                       There were five categories, each of which contained sub-sets of publications with
                                       varying themes, purposes or target groups. These categories were: ICLEI Case Studies;
                                       ICLEI Briefing Sheets; ICLEI Papers; ICLEI Global Reports; and, ICLEI Annual Reports.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e519">On 21 February 2013, unaware of ICLEI’s intention to archive the website, the researchers
                                       downloaded all ICLEI case studies. A subsequent check ensured no further publications
                                       were added prior to archiving, meaning the downloaded files may be said to provide
                                       a complete and accurate record for the period from ICLEI’s foundation up until the
                                       end of February 2013. Case studies published during 2013–2015 have subsequently been
                                       downloaded from the new website, providing an almost complete record of ICLEI case
                                       studies and enabling assessment of the collections’ development over time. It is possible
                                       that other documents relevant to the study but unavailable on the website exist in
                                       other forms or locations, e.g. as paper copies, or in collections not mentioned on
                                       the Publications page. However, notwithstanding this uncertainty, it may be reasonably
                                       inferred that the case study collections used as the empirical data for this study
                                       are representative and likely to provide interesting insights into the ways in which
                                       municipal work for issues concerning sustainable development are portrayed by this
                                       particular TMN.

                                                global and continental/regional. As such, some, but not all, ICLEI regional Secretariats
                                                issues case study collections that focus exclusively on their member countries. Including
                                                such collections would thus distort the balance of this study. The second choice thus
                                                limits the scope of the case study collections assessed in this study to those that
                                                are international in scope, as opposed to collections primarily defined by their geographic

                                                development) and other collections that are thematic or project-related yet international
                                                in scope, the ability to draw conclusions concerning thematic focus is likely to be
                                                skewed somewhat in favour of the themes addressed in such collections.

                                    <p id="d1e542">In other words, it is possible to be quite categorical about data concerning continents,
                                       countries and cities, whereas the study of themes or topics addressed in case studies
                                       necessarily implies some degree of interpretation and subjectivity, in the sense that
                                       themes or topics may overlap, or there may be discrepancies between words and content
                                       within or between case studies. It is not possible to be quite so categorical. Thus,
                                       to clarify, the thematic results presented in this study have been developed in the
                                       following way.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e544">First, the key words from the titles of case studies have been added to the main data
                                       sheet (see below) in which empirical data are stored. Key words are verbs, adjectives
                                       or nouns that influence the composition of the title and its emphasis. To ensure data
                                       was collected from all studies, in the absence of a clear title this information was
                                       extracted from the case study’s summary or abstract. In the same way, approximations
                                       or synonyms were used to simplify data collection. As such, the thematic analysis
                                       provides a reasonably good overview of the thematic focus of case studies, but little
                                       information about the content of studies. The thematic data are indicative and should
                                       only be interpreted as such. Deeper review or content analysis would be required to
                                       make any larger claims concerning its significance or the evidence of trends, etc.

                                    <p id="d1e546">In addition, it should be noted that the collections do not only present municipal
                                       examples. A small number of other sub-national entities such as counties, regions
                                       or states are represented, as are several national initiatives (e.g. from Mexico,
                                       Norway and India), one company (from the USA), and ICLEI CCP campaign. There is also
                                       a risk that municipalities represented for specific actions in the main ICLEI Case
                                       Study series reappear in the other collections (i.e. that the main topic of a case
                                       study is repeated across collections). Ultimately, the main focus of this paper is
                                       not to provide methodological certainty about such issues, but rather to identify
                                       the frequency at which municipalities are represented in international collections
                                       and illustrate general trends concerning themes.

                                          <p id="d1e747">During the first period, case studies from six African countries were represented
                                             in the collections, including one study from Senegal in West Africa, a Francophone
                                             nation. This example stands out, being the only such case during the two periods.
                                             Indeed, despite an overall, if small, increase in the number of studies on African
                                             examples during the second period, fewer African countries are represented in this
                                             period. South Africa emerges as the dominant subject of case studies. During both
                                             periods, there are no examples from Northern Africa, the Sahara or the Horn, including
                                             populous countries such as Nigeria, Ethiopia, Egypt or DR Congo. South Africa is,
                                             of course, a fairly urbanised nation, yet so too are nations such as Algeria, Libya,
                                             or Tunisia. It is thus interesting to consider why the presentation of “Africa” in
                                             ICLEI case study collections has increasingly come to mean Anglophone, Southern (South)

                                             decades has been subject to rapid urbanisation. It is thus no surprise that there
                                             was an increase in studies on Asian nations over time. In particular, examples from
                                             India and Japan were the subject of a large number of case studies, particularly compared
                                             to the first period. Perhaps surprisingly, China—with its large population and economy,
                                             significant environmental challenges, and rapid urbanisation—is not so well represented,
                                             although several other populous countries in the region, such as Iran, Pakistan and
                                             Vietnam are not subjects of any case studies. Interestingly, South Korea, as host
                                             to ICLEI offices, receives no more representation than Thailand. No countries from
                                             Central Asia are represented in case studies.

                                          <p id="d1e757">The pattern of representation in case studies for European countries was fairly consistent,
                                             albeit with increased volume and diversity after 2002. However, few examples from
                                             former-Soviet countries are recorded as case studies, and together, Germany and Sweden
                                             account for 47% of all European case studies. In the case of Germany this is perhaps
                                             unsurprising as the country has Europe’s largest population and economy and a long
                                             history of environmental engagement. Moreover, ICLEI’s European Secretariat has been
                                             located in Freiburg since 1991, and since 2010, the World Secretariat has been based
                                             in Bonn.

                                          <p id="d1e759">However, the number of Swedish examples may appear, given the country’s size, surprising,
                                             despite the country’s history with Local Agenda 21 and its other efforts to increase
                                             sustainability. The Swedish share perhaps reflects the strong degree of municipal
                                             autonomy and resource base of Swedish municipalities [<a href="#R60">60</a>, <a href="#R61">61</a>]. It may also be influenced by resources of those seeking to access (and produce)
                                             information, in that some forms of policy search and information collection (e.g.
                                             search engines) may favour examples that are (a) already disseminated, (b) documented,
                                             and (c) in English. Many Swedish municipalities have, over a long period of time,
                                             successfully managed to document and disseminate their experiences in English to wide
                                             audiences via Internet.

                                             first, that Mexico is the only country from Central America and the Caribbean with
                                             case studies in the collection; and second, the reduction in examples from the USA
                                             during the second period (offset by seven publications during 2015). Indeed, Canadian
                                             municipalities are the subject of almost as many case studies as US municipalities
                                             since 2002. This may reflect a number of issues, e.g. US domestic politics (although
                                             some would argue Canadian politics with regard to environmental issues has not been
                                             dissimilar); an increase in the availability of other platforms (e.g. the US Conference
                                             of Mayors); or the strong role of Canadian municipalities in ICLEI, with Toronto hosting
                                             the World Secretariat from 1991-2010, Edmonton hosting the 2009 World Congress, and

                                       Europe (47.5), South America (40) and North America (31) have the largest number of

                                       region’s total varies considerably (see Figure <a href="#Fig04">4</a>). This measure reveals the relative diversity of the case studies represented per

                                       region have in the total 298 case studies. Figure <a href="#Fig05">5</a> shows that multiple case studies from Europe (16%) and South America (13%) account
                                       for 29% of all case studies. Together with North America (10%), multiple case studies
                                       from these three continental regions account for 39% of all studies. In other words,
                                       specific municipalities from these continental regions are represented so frequently
                                       that their combined total is greater than that of the combined total for all case
                                       studies from Africa, Asia, Central America, the Middle East and Oceania combined (35%).
                                       Likewise, the total is greater than that for the combined total of single examples
                                       (i.e. those appearing only once) from Europe, North America and South America.

                                       looking exclusively at multiple case studies. The countries named in Figure <a href="#Fig06">6</a> account for 79% of multiple case studies and approximately 41% of all studies.

                                       collections, i.e. the multiples. These are all represented in the countries named
                                       in Figure <a href="#Fig06">6</a>, and it is perhaps no surprise that the three of the six most-represented municipalities
                                       are located in Brazil.

                                       the 23 municipalities are located in Europe, North America and South America; there
                                       are no Central American, Middle Eastern or Oceanic examples.

                                    <p id="d1e838">The prominence of these municipalities may have various causes and it is possible
                                       to speculate about possible implications of these choices. It could be that these
                                       cases were or are judged, according to some criteria or purely subjective terms, to
                                       be the most relevant, successful, innovative, etc. However, other criteria may have
                                       played a role, e.g. participation in ICLEI projects, status as an ICLEI host city
                                       (Freiburg, São Paulo, Toronto), host to ICLEI World Congresses (Belo Horizonte, Cape
                                       Town, Edmonton), or other roles in ICLEI (e.g. representative in Executive Committee).
                                       As ICLEI is a membership organisation, it would be surprising if there were no such
                                       effects. Indeed, such representation is an important function of the organisation.

                                       inhabitants on the island of Mallorca, are obvious outliers in terms of size, although
                                       there are no smaller (i.e. village/rural) municipalities. Sixteen of the municipalities
                                       in Figure <a href="#Fig07">7</a> have populations in the range of approximately 400,000 to 5,000,000, accounting for
                                       72% of studies on these 23 municipalities, and 23% of all studies. (The municipalities

                                       Seoul and Växjö). In other words, 16 municipalities account for almost one quarter
                                       of all ICLEI case studies on sustainable development at the local level. The 12 most-represented

                                    <p id="d1e856">A number of verbs and adjectives are deployed when constructing titles. Those that
                                       appeared most frequently were synonymous with “Involving” (34), “Reducing” (19), “Promoting/encouraging”
                                       (17), “Implementing/action” (15), “Managing” (15), and “Integrated/integration” (15).
                                       11 studies referred to “leadership/best” but only 3 mentioned “ambition”. Of other
                                       categories, 3 mentioned “fighting/combating” and 3 “benefiting”. The use of such words
                                       seems to imply an emphasis on participation and awareness-raising, strategic management,
                                       and actions to reduce negative impacts.

                                       (37) or energy conservation/energy efficiency (31). Other prominent sub-themes/measures

                                 by testing ICLEI’s claim that the case studies presented in a 2012 report were “not
                                 the usual suspects” [<a href="#R28">28</a>], it is possible to both substantiate and refute their claim. Seven of the case studies
                                 featured in “Showcasing progress” involved municipalities (and a national programme)
                                 that had not previously been included in the nine case study collections assessed
                                 in this study.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e925">However, seven case studies did present examples from municipalities already featured
                                 in the nine collections. Two of these municipalities (Iida and Reykjavik) had only
                                 previously featured in one collection (Climate Roadmap), but five municipalities had
                                 featured on multiple occasions: Betim (6.5 other studies), Cape Town (2 other studies),
                                 Ethekwini (Durban), Portland, and Toronto (each 3 other studies). The last three municipalities
                                 have subsequently appeared in a total of five more studies and must therefore be considered
                                 to be very much the usual suspects. In contrast, only one (Thane, India) of the “unusual”
                                 suspects included in the 2012 report has subsequently been the subject of a new case
                                 study. This indicates that although the overall number of municipalities represented
                                 in the collections has increased, some of the “usual suspects” have consolidated their
                                 position (indeed, Belo Horizonte is the study of another case study published in 2016).
                                 
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e927">This tends to underline the validity of claims that certain kinds of municipalities
                                 appear more frequently than others in discussions on sustainable development. The
                                 author do not take the view that such imbalances arise from any particular biases
                                 or wilful distortions, but are more likely to offer insights into limitations to ICLEI’s
                                 organisational resources and capacities, conditions of project financing, or lack
                                 of knowledge or information about alternative possible cases. Municipalities that
                                 have been engaged in ICLEI’s work in an active way, over a long period of time, may
                                 feature more prominently.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e929">Nonetheless, the financial resources and administrative capacity of municipalities
                                 may also play an important role in determining who are the subject of case studies.
                                 Municipalities with limited resources or capacity are unlikely to have time to invest
                                 in working collaboratively on the content of a case study. These findings indicate
                                 that TMNs such as ICLEI may need to make a more determined effort to address absences
                                 in collections, or adopt clearer criteria for case selection in order to justify presence.
                                 There are not necessarily inherent reasons why repetition of examples is problematic
                                 (indeed, such repetition may highlight progress or stagnation over time); nevertheless,
                                 there is a need to be explicit about why selections are made and disseminated.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e931">Some authors cite unequal access to resources as a key determinant of power relationships
                                 (see e.g. [<a href="#R62">62</a>]), but such arguments will not be explored here, as the results of this paper provide
                                 only superficial evidence for such claims. Nevertheless, the results do highlight
                                 a number of interesting points, which may support or refute different theoretical
                                 claims about the use of case studies. For example, the results suggest some degree
                                 of ethnocentrism, or at least a lack of plurality, in line with the claims made by
                                 authors such as [<a href="#R40">40</a>, <a href="#R41">41</a>, <a href="#R42">42</a>, <a href="#R43">43</a>]. This should not be interpreted as a criticism of ICLEI, as 51 countries are featured
                                 in the nine collections, and there is no inherent reason for any or all countries
                                 to be included, just as there is no clear way of evaluating which particular municipality
                                 should be considered the most appropriate for any given case study, or indeed if practices
                                 in one context may or may not be diffused to other contexts.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e948">However, the issue is worthy of discussion. The majority of case studies in the nine
                                 collections present examples from Europe and the Americas, at the expense of other
                                 continental regions. Moreover, a lack of plurality is observed within Europe (i.e.
                                 few former-Soviet countries) and the Americas (i.e. few Central American or Caribbean
                                 countries, overwhelming emphasis on Brazil, Canada and USA). The reasons for this
                                 are unclear, perhaps reflecting resources, history, specific themes or roles within
                                 ICLEI. Similarly, Oceania appears to be a synonym for Australia (and New Zealand),
                                 and examples from vast tracts of Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia are absent
                                 from the collections. Within North America, another trend is the declining number
                                 of case studies addressing the USA in the second period of the study (a trend masked
                                 only by a flurry of case studies issued in 2015). Again, a number of inferences may
                                 be made about this, some of which may appear oppositional e.g. an increased scepticism
                                 on the part of the USA concerning environmental issues, or an increased concern, leading
                                 to national initiatives on sustainability issues, such as that spearheaded by the
                                 US Conference of Mayors.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e950">The population size of countries appears to play a limited role in determining the
                                 subjects of case studies. Various populous countries are not represented at all (e.g.
                                 Nigeria, Pakistan, Russia), while others (e.g. Bangladesh, China) are seldom featured.
                                 Nonetheless, frequently-represented examples tend to come from medium-large municipalities
                                 (with an interest in green branding, see e.g. [<a href="#R32">32</a>]), with megacities and small municipalities less frequently represented. Again, it
                                 is only possible to speculate at the reasons for this, which may include resources,
                                 languages and the linguistic capacity of ICLEI staff in different continental regions,
                                 or perhaps a lack of political organisation or perceptions concerning the limited
                                 relevance of the sustainable development agenda (and lack of potential studies) in
                                 some contexts. It is also entirely possible that municipalities in some regions are
                                 active in other municipal associations or disseminate information about their work
                                 in other ways (e.g. through initiatives such as “Villes Durables” of the International
                                 Organisation of La Francophonie or equivalent networks). This does not preclude the
                                 importance of scrutinising representation in ICLEI collections, but rather emphasises
                                 the need for further research of this kind.

                              <p id="d1e958">This paper aimed to assess the ways in which the composition of ICLEI case study collections
                                 may influence the framing of the practice and study of sustainable development in
                                 municipalities. More specifically, by identifying the patterns of representation in
                                 the collections, the paper aimed to identify whether any “usual suspects” are obvious
                                 in ICLEI’s case study collections. The results of this study suggest that there is
                                 evidence of both over- and under-representation of continental regions, countries
                                 and themes in the nine international case study collections published by ICLEI. Moreover,
                                 a number of municipalities from a small number of countries emerge as “usual suspects”
                                 in the collections. This underlines the importance of theoretical claims concerning
                                 the risks of imbalances when using case studies to portray municipal work for sustainable
                                 development and the need to reflect on the implications of presence and absence in
                                 framing sustainable development.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e960">Future research could add to understanding by deepening the study. For example, content
                                 or discourse analysis could be used to assess the actual content of case studies.
                                 An alternative variation would be to consider the membership status of case study
                                 subjects and attempt to investigate whether membership/insider status influences the
                                 selection of case study subjects. Another approach would be to widen the study and
                                 contrast the composition of ICLEI collections with similar collections published by
                                 other municipal networks, or to complement the study by contrasting the overall composition
                                 of associations’ literature with that of academic literature or other interest organisations.
                                 Alternatively, a study of “invisible” or absent municipalities operating outside of
                                 TMNs could improve understanding of their actions, thereby making a significant contribution
                                 to literature on municipalities and TMNs.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e962">In sum, this study provides insight into a core function of TMNs, the production and
                                 dissemination of information, knowledge and best practice. A significant body of literature
                                 has explored the role of TMNs in capacity-building and evaluation, as representatives
                                 of municipalities in the international system, and the case studies and practices
                                 of specific municipalities. However, to date, there has been limited discussion or
                                 quantification of the ways in which TMNs present and disseminate information and in
                                 doing so, generate representational trends that emphasise “usual suspects” and avoid
                                 discussion of others.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e964">The case of ICLEI illustrates this point, yet a wider study including other TMNs and
                                 case study collections would perhaps result in a similar conclusion. Indeed, the presence
                                 of “usual suspects” may not necessarily be entirely negative. The point is, there
                                 is a clear need to improve our understanding of who the “usual suspects” are or are
                                 not. Such understanding would assist in understanding the appropriateness of using
                                 such cases as illustrations of different phenomena, and may well promote an increase
                                 in the diversity of examples in case studies on urban sustainability published by
                                 TMNs and scholars. Moreover, understanding the representation patterns influencing
                                 <i>which</i> municipalities and <i>what</i> topics are presented in discourses may also contribute to scientific understanding
                                 of other processes, such as the role of non-state actors in climate governance. These
                                 issues are worthy of exploration in future research.
