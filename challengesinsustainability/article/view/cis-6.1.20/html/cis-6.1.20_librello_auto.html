                                 reach that has been developed to encourage responsible and sustainable forest management.
                                 Despite its broad appeal, there is little scientific assessment to substantiate the
                                 effectiveness of FSC in the boreal zone. In this study, an ecosystem-based and participatory
                                 approach was applied to a case study in the Arkhangelsk Region of the Russia Federation
                                 to assess the potential influence of the principles, criteria and indicators of the
                                 Russian FSC standard. An ECOSEFFECT theoretical plausibility analysis was conducted
                                 to evaluate the potential effectiveness of FSC in safeguarding the ecological integrity
                                 of the ecosystem. Besides spatial analysis and a field visitation, core elements of
                                 the methodological procedure were workshops with experts and stakeholders who directly
                                 contributed to knowledge mapping and analysis. The results of the study suggest FSC
                                 can potentially influence and improve forest management including monitoring and evaluation,
                                 foster the institutional capacity, and enhance knowledge on the impacts of forest
                                 management. Theoretically, FSC has a certain potential to reduce a range of anthropogenic
                                 threats to the ecosystem, such as large-scale deforestation and forest degradation,
                                 logging of High Conservation Value Forests, large size of clear-cuts, excessive annual
                                 allowable cuts, damage to trees during forest operations, and hydrological changes.
                                 However, human-induced fire is the only ecological stress that was assumed to be effectively
                                 tackled through a strong and positive influence of FSC. The results of the theoretical
                                 analysis with a semi-quantitative evaluation revealed the potential for FSC to generate
                                 much more effective outcomes for biodiversity by prudently targeting key ecological
                                 problems. The biggest problem is the large-scale clear-cutting practice, especially
                                 within IFL. These devastating practices are not promoted by, but are compliant with
                                 the current Russian FSC standard. This feeds doubts about the consistency of FSC practice
                                 and its credibility.</span></div>

                                 to promote responsible management of the world’s forests that is environmentally appropriate,
                                 socially beneficial, and economically viable [<a href="#R01">1</a>]. Based on a generic certification system with a given set of general principles
                                 and criteria, 46 national standards for 38 different countries have been formulated
                                 and approved, each with their own specific indicators, verifiers, norms, and guidance
                                 [<a href="#R02">2</a>]. FSC is a market-based tool that has been prepared by a multi-stakeholder group
                                 and is the most widely adopted forest standard, already covering 196 million hectares
                                 of the forest across 83 different countries worldwide [<a href="#R03">3</a>]. Motivated by ethical concerns for the environment and underpinned by the Sustainable
                                 Development Goals as well as international directives to safeguard biodiversity, FSC
                                 is regarded as a powerful instrument to achieve Sustainable Forest Management (SFM)
                                 [<a href="#R04">4</a>]. SFM aims to commercially use forests without compromising biodiversity, biomass
                                 productivity, the capacity for natural regeneration, vitality, and the functionality
                                 to provide ecosystem services in the long-term and without threatening other ecological
                                 systems [<a href="#R05">5</a>].

                                 use of natural resources taking into account the inherent dynamics and complexity
                                 of ecological systems [<a href="#R08">8</a>]. It acknowledges the close interrelation and interdependency of ecological and anthropogenic
                                 systems as well as the need for protecting biodiversity when utilizing natural resources
                                 [<a href="#R09">9</a>]. The reduction of present and future anthropogenic threats to biodiversity fosters
                                 ecosystem resilience by supporting ecosystem functionality in the long-term, and in
                                 doing so, increasing the ability of ecosystems to cope with perturbations and environmental

                                 as improved communication processes and the resolution of conflicts [<a href="#R13">13</a>]. For instance, FSC certification induced beneficial social outcomes in terms of
                                 living conditions of forest workers and benefit-sharing in the Congo basin [<a href="#R14">14</a>]. In Tanzania, FSC-certified community forests showed improved forest structure and
                                 forest regeneration as well as a less fire incidents [<a href="#R15">15</a>]. Nevertheless, the effects of FSC certification on the management of community forests
                                 are often limited and do not necessarily refer to certification itself, but to the
                                 emphasis of public policy and positive institutional influence [<a href="#R16">16</a>]. Regarding short-term environmental impacts, FSC certification led to a slight reduction
                                 in logging damage, impacts from skidding trails and roads, and loss of above-ground
                                 biomass in Gabon [<a href="#R17">17</a>]. In Indonesia, FSC certification decreased deforestation and air pollution and was
                                 associated with benefits to local communities including health issues, but still,
                                 forest management for timber harvesting causes ecosystem disturbance [<a href="#R18">18</a>]. Amongst three different commercial forest reserves in Malaysia, mammal species
                                 richness including threatened species and above-ground biomass were highest in a FSC-certified
                                 area [<a href="#R19">19</a>]. In Mediterranean oak woodlands, FSC had a positive effect on stream quality after
                                 five years by enhancing riparian vegetation [<a href="#R20">20</a>]. In a global panel analysis it was concluded that forest certification can reduce
                                 deforestation directly and indirectly [<a href="#R21">21</a>]. However, logging activities under FSC cannot always be associated with lower carbon
                                 emissions [<a href="#R22">22</a>].

                                 Federation [<a href="#R03">3</a>]. The increasing demand for certified timber together with an active promotion from
                                 international organisations, especially from environmental NGOs, has been the main
                                 driving force behind FSC certification in the Russian Federation [<a href="#R23">23</a>]. However, evidence for the environmental benefits of FSC is to be found mainly in
                                 the tropical and subtropical biomes. In contrast, there have been very few studies
                                 published on FSC practices in boreal forests, and those that have are restricted to
                                 EU-countries such as Sweden or Finland, and to North America. A study conducted in
                                 12 stands in the USA concluded that FSC-certified harvesting showed no significant
                                 differences at stand level in comparison to non-certified forestry, except for an
                                 increase in woody residues [<a href="#R24">24</a>]. In the boreal forests of the Russian Federation less evidence about the impacts
                                 of FSC certification was produced. Maintaining the functionality of the Russian forests
                                 is highly relevant, as forest cover in the Russian Federation is the most extensive
                                 of all the larger countries [<a href="#R25">25</a>]. In 2010, forest was estimated to cover almost 800 million hectares of the Russian

                                 allowed in accordance with the forest code [<a href="#R28">28</a>]. In more recent times, the predominantly high intensity timber logging, clear-cuttings,
                                 and human-induced fires have caused substantial tree cover losses and ecosystem degradation
                                 [<a href="#R29">29</a>]. The transformation from intact forest landscapes (IFL) to forests that are deeply
                                 fragmented, especially in European Russia, changed the ecology of the region and threatens
                                 to reduce ecosystem functionality in the long-term [<a href="#R30">30</a>]. At present, within the Arkhangelsk Region and the Komi Republic, large tracts of
                                 IFL remain [<a href="#R31">31</a>], but at the same time these areas continue to suffer from substantive tree cover
                                 loss [<a href="#R29">29</a>, <a href="#R32">32</a>]. The FSC promotes the preservation of IFL as part of high conservation value forests
                                 (HCVF) [<a href="#R33">33</a>]. The reduction of logging in primary forests and the identification of HCVF were

                                 conservation in the Russian Federation [<a href="#R23">23</a>]. Specifically, in tracts of forest managed as clear-cut, those areas spared from
                                 felling are important landscape elements for biodiversity and are promoted by FSC
                                 certification [<a href="#R34">34</a>]. Nevertheless, most studies about the impacts of FSC in the Russian Federation focus
                                 on issues relating to governance and society [<a href="#R35">35</a>, <a href="#R36">36</a>, <a href="#R37">37</a>, <a href="#R38">38</a>], and much less on ecological effects.

                                    <p id="d1e344">The methodological framework ECOSEFFECT (<i>ECOsystem-based assessment of Sustainability standards and their EFFECTiveness</i>), used in this study is based on MARISCO, an adaptive and proactive conservation
                                       management tool [<a href="#R45">45</a>, <a href="#R46">46</a>]. The applied method is grounded in an ecosystem approach which includes the principle
                                       that humans and their economic activities are an integral part of the global ecosystem
                                       and depend on the full functioning of ecosystems. In the case of forests and their
                                       management it becomes especially apparent that both economic and social sustainability
                                       entirely depend on the functioning of the ecosystem. For this reason we postulate
                                       a clear ‘hierarchy of sustainabilities’ reflecting that the sustainable existence
                                       and functioning of the ecosystem is a <i>conditio sine qua non</i> for any dependent subsystem. To justify the development and use of a sustainability
                                       standard for ecosystem management such as FSC requires proof of its effectiveness
                                       in safeguarding the ecology and the integrity of the service-provisioning system.
                                       Beneficial influences of FSC on the social and economic sphere can be important achievements,
                                       which are very much appreciated, but if short-term benefits for human well-being do
                                       not translate into potential ecological outcomes then they are irrelevant to our study
                                       (e.g., safety requirements that lead to reduced injuries of forest workers does not
                                       induce any positive impacts in the forest ecosystem [<a href="#R47">47</a>]). Nevertheless, we fully recognize the complexity inherent in nature and its relationship
                                       with society. The evaluation of the benefits and gains made by applying certification
                                       cannot focus solely on changes in forests and forest management operations, but also
                                       requires an analytical framework that carefully considers the causal origin of outcomes
                                       [<a href="#R48">48</a>]. ECOSEFFECT scrutinizes the human-induced threats to ecosystems and the ability
                                       of sustainability standards to reduce the resulting ecological stresses by abating
                                       the underlying drivers of negative environmental change. The human dimension, including
                                       social and economic aspects, appears in the analysis as the drivers of environmental
                                       change on the one hand and on the other hand human well-being is directly affected
                                       by the consequences of deteriorated ecosystems. The approach taken deliberately applies
                                       a systemic framework with as much of the complex situation and prevailing conditions
                                       represented as possible. It pools information from experts and stakeholders, and is

                                    <p id="d1e848">Ecosystem Diagnostics Analysis (EDA) is the first step in ECOSEFFECT and comprises
                                       a desktop assessment of available spatial data combined with quick field visitations
                                       of a designated project site or landscape. In the spatial analysis, forest cover and
                                       evidence of land cover change were examined as preparation for both the conceptualisation
                                       of the situation analysis and a field inspection. Data on annual tree cover loss between
                                       2001 and 2014 [<a href="#R50">50</a>] was used to look at logging patterns and to calculate tree cover loss before and
                                       during FSC certification, as well as in the forest landscape outside of FSC-certified
                                       concessions. Maps on the spatial distribution of FSC-certified forest management units
                                       (FMU) as of May 2016 [<a href="#R51">51</a>] were processed, the issue date for each certificate holder was revised according
                                       to available certificates [<a href="#R52">52</a>], and the dataset was clipped with annual tree cover loss [<a href="#R50">50</a>] using the software ArcGIS [<a href="#R53">53</a>]. In the spatial analysis, the relative year in relation to the implementation of
                                       FSC was computed. In particular, tree cover loss that occurred within a logging concession
                                       before it was FSC-certified was classified as “before FSC”. Tree cover loss classified
                                       as “during FSC” implies that the tree cover was lost while an FSC-certificate was
                                       valid. Tree cover loss in the initial and final year of certification as well as tree
                                       cover loss after FSC certification (altogether accounting for 12% of the dataset within
                                       FSC concessions) was excluded from the analysis to reduce uncertainty, as it was unclear
                                       if that particular moment of tree cover loss was recorded just before or after certification.

                                    <p id="d1e887">A situation analysis describes the process of systemically collecting available knowledge
                                       to assess the conditions within a region of interest, including the vulnerability
                                       of biodiversity, and the complex interaction of the main drivers of change. A three-day
                                       workshop was launched in June 2014 close to the city of Arkhangelsk to conduct a situation

                                       analysis were visualised in a conceptual model presenting a systemic knowledge map
                                       depicting causally interlinked factors that are responsible for shaping the actual
                                       situation within the scope (Figure <a href="#Fig1">1</a>).

                                    <p id="d1e897">The systemic analysis began with the identification of the main ecosystem types and
                                       the fundamentals necessary to maintain full ecological function, the so-called key
                                       ecological attributes (KEA). Other information imported into the conceptual model
                                       include a list of aspects relating to human well-being, which is supported by ecosystem
                                       services provided by functional ecosystems on the one side, and by social services
                                       generated by social systems on the other side. Observable and also speculated environmental
                                       stresses that represent negative impacts on biodiversity were compiled as well as
                                       the contribution and interaction of the different pressures or threats that cause
                                       environmental stresses. The respective drivers of threats, called contributing factors,
                                       were also incorporated into the conceptual model. After cumulating and arranging all
                                       elements comprising the conceptual model (Table <a href="#Tab3">3</a>), the various systemic components were interlinked according to the most logical

                                       in order to generate a complex and complete picture of the forests and the impacts
                                       of human interventions. The key question for this ‘backward-moving’ procedure detecting
                                       potential causality was “Where does this come from? What are the direct drivers?”.

                                       and refining of the analysis by the stakeholders participating in the process based
                                       on their knowledge and assumptions, until the best possible representation of the

                                    <p id="d1e1317">The Arkhangelsk Region comprises an area of around 31 million hectares of which almost
                                       half is classified as forest (as of 2000) [<a href="#R50">50</a>]. The complex ecosystem mosaic of forests, rivers and mires is fragmented by roads.
                                       Large tracts of managed forest are under FSC certification (Figure <a href="#Fig3">3</a>).
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e1325">The implementation of FSC in the Arkhangelsk Region first started in 2004 with the
                                       certification of two companies encompassing around 235 thousand hectares. FSC-certified
                                       areas have been increasing up to more than 9 million hectares, leased under 41 different
                                       companies in 2016 (Figure <a href="#Fig4">4</a>).
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e1330">Over the years commercial logging has reshaped the natural boreal forest ecosystem
                                       into a patchwork of checkerboard-like patterns created by systematic geometric clear-cutting
                                       (Figure <a href="#Fig5">5</a>a).
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e1335">The clear-cuts appear as geometrical rectangles, and forest roads become visible as
                                       straight lines of tree cover loss, whereas larger irregular patches of tree cover
                                       loss are most likely burnt sites, but could also be the results of deforestation for
                                       mining activities. Due to the inaccessibility of remote forest areas and the absence
                                       of local population, the small and diffuse patches of tree cover loss were not referred
                                       to logging but classified as forest die-back. Examples of die-back, particularly in
                                       spruce forest, were noticed in unmanaged stands during field-trips in the neighborhood
                                       of clear-cuts. Across most of the study area, the systematic harvesting of timber
                                       brought about a distinctive ‘checkerboard’-pattern that has been steadily increasing
                                       both within and outside FSC-certified areas. [15]The consecutive, year-by-year clear-cuts
                                       add up to larger continuous clear-cuts without any substantial remaining tree cover
                                       that can be several square kilometers across (Figure <a href="#Fig5">5</a>b). Legal logging activities, also in FSC-certified logging concessions, have contributed
                                       to a considerable decrease in the extent of IFL in 2013 in comparison to 2000 and
                                       logging patterns in the example area show how the remaining IFL has been shrinking
                                       in recent years and how formerly continuous tracts of forest are now fragmented and
                                       can be prone to tree dieback (Figure <a href="#Fig5">5</a>c).

                                       were affected by tree cover loss, of which more than half was recorded within the

                                       experts and stakeholders suggests that all identified and rated contributing factors
                                       are important or extremely important in increasing the overall vulnerability of the
                                       conservation objects, which is represented by high values of <i>‘criticality’</i>. <b>Contributing factors</b> relating to governance and socio-economics, forest management, institutional capacity
                                       and knowledge as well as nature protection are assumed to be the major and persistent
                                       drivers of negative changes in the taiga of the Arkhangelsk Region. The <b>threats</b> that are rated highest for criticality are linked to problems of <i>“Deforestation and forest degradation”, “Infrastructure within the forest”</i>, the <i>“Construction of non-forest roads”</i>, and <i>“Extreme weather events”</i>. The problem of large-scale clear-cuts (<i>“Too big size of clear-cut”</i>), which in turn links up to <i>“Harvesting in HCVF, including intact forests”</i>, and <i>“Forest infrastructure”</i> is recorded as highly critical to the long-term security of biodiversity.

                                       are linked to governance and include <i>“Too many norms, legislations &amp; regulations”, “Poor legislation &amp; guidelines”</i> as well as the institutional factor <i>“Lack of long-term multipurpose planning”</i>. This suggests ambiguous and contradictory legal instruments and governance, together
                                       with insufficient specifications, hamper the effective implementation of ecologically
                                       relevant legislations. The strategically most relevant threats refer to large-scale
                                       forest degradation, infrastructure, landform configuration, and climate change. Changes
                                       to the natural structure and character of habitats are considered to be the most strategically
                                       relevant stresses including <i>“More homogenous and contrast spatial structure”, “Diversity of forest ecosystem is

                                       addressed only once, but several strategies refer to the same contributing factor
                                       several times (Figure <a href="#Fig8">8</a>).

                                       influence of the strategies ranges from weak and negative to strong and positive,
                                       whilst most strategies appear to influence contributing factors in a weak and positive
                                       way (Figure <a href="#Fig9">9</a>).

                                    <p id="d1e1610">All contributing factors that are rated as being highly and very highly strategically
                                       relevant are addressed by FSC, whereas the two strategically relevant contributing
                                       factors <i>“Inadequate government control (of nature use)”</i> and <i>“Mining”</i>, as well as the two strategically less relevant factors <i>“Wish to make quick money”</i> and <i>“Violations of technological regulations”</i>, are understandably not covered by FSC (Figure <a href="#Fig10">10</a>).

                                    <p id="d1e1627">Most of the strategies derived from the FSC criteria are assumed to target one or
                                       several of the contributing factors. A total of 17 strategies (including nine based
                                       on criteria describing principle 10: “Plantations”) do not target any of the threats
                                       or contributing factors in the conceptual model. Some of the strategies are seen to
                                       relate more often to certain contributing factors than others. For example, criterion

                                       to be documented and promptly paid. The attendance by staff on training in the proper
                                       implementation of FSC and on forest management planning would, hypothetically enhance
                                       their level of knowledge, expertise, and proficiency. The expectation would be for
                                       clear and obvious compliance with laws and international treaties ratified by the
                                       Russian Federation.

                                    <p id="d1e1673">According to the experts, all factors relating to forest management would be directly
                                       influenced by various FSC criteria. As a possible outcome, the management objectives
                                       of a certified company would be defined in the long-term, at least for a minimum of
                                       five years. Poor forest management is expected to improve in certified forest companies
                                       by amending the forest management plans according to the findings of an Environmental
                                       Impact Assessment (EIA). In theory, the EIA would be conducted and a forest monitoring
                                       system would be established according to the guidelines anchored in the FSC standard.
                                       Moreover, it is assumed an economic analysis would be conducted and the findings incorporated
                                       into the forest management plan. A monitoring program is supposed to be established,
                                       being clearly documented, consistent, replicable, and regularly revised by the FSC-certified
                                       forest companies. Deviations from the management plan and discrepancies between actual
                                       and expected results would be assessed and considered in the revision of the management
                                       plan. It is presumed that transparency would be enhanced through the publication of
                                       management documents and monitoring results for certified companies, except in cases
                                       where confidentiality is required. Consequently, the quality of available information
                                       would be enhanced, including environmental, economic, and social aspects of forestry
                                       as well as improved access to information on natural resources for planning purposes.
                                       In addition, FSC is expected to deliver improvements in the availability of data on
                                       yields, growth rates, forest composition, regeneration, and changes in the composition
                                       of flora and fauna.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e1675">The analysis concludes that FSC would lead to a reduction of logging in primary or
                                       old-growth forests. In theory, FSC requires HCVF areas to be identified and considered
                                       in the planning and the implementation process of forest management operations. Stakeholders,
                                       such as local people, authorities, administrations, and forest managers would be technically
                                       consulted, especially in the frame of a social impact analysis. Land-use rights for
                                       indigenous people and their access to natural resources are requirements for companies
                                       operating under FSC. The interests of local communities extend to unrestricted access
                                       to timber and non-timber forest resources. In principle, the FSC PCI are designed
                                       to reduce the risk of disputes and grievances between local communities and commercial
                                       companies, and in part, this is achieved through an anticipated enhancement in environmental
                                       and social awareness amongst forest workers and staff by providing training, and by
                                       employing predominantly local people with strong concerns for the forest and its natural
                                       resources.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e1677">In theory, the planning and implementation of forest management under FSC takes into
                                       account international treaties as well as conventions on biodiversity conservation
                                       and protected areas. For example, the identification, monitoring, and protection of
                                       rare, threatened and endangered species, key habitats, and HCVF would be developed
                                       by researchers and in consultation with specialists and other stakeholders, and then
                                       implemented by the certified company. Thus, in theory, it is assumed that HCVF and
                                       undisturbed areas would be protected from forestry activities and buffer zones would
                                       be established around sensitive sites. Under FSC, water protection zones would be
                                       maintained and riparian areas that have been degraded by forest operations would be
                                       restored. Moreover, a network of representative examples of existing ecosystems is
                                       supposed to be established and management restrictions observed. The effectiveness
                                       of conservation measures on HCVF would be assessed annually by the certified company.
                                       Participants assume that under FSC, the annual allowable cut (AAC) is calculated sustainably.
                                       Forest operations would take account of economically inaccessible regions and areas
                                       where logging is restricted, such as in HCVF. The rationale for the calculation of
                                       AAC and planned harvesting level is expected to be provided in the management plan
                                       of FSC-certified logging companies. The financial resources needed to implement the
                                       forest management plan would be available at certified companies. As a potential result,
                                       it is postulated that forest management would be conducted according to the management
                                       plan and any negative environmental impacts due to forest operations described as
                                       “cut-and-go practice” are reduced.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e1679">FSC promotes the use of all merchantable woody resources and the diversification of
                                       utilized and processed forest products. Thus, it is assumed that a FSC-certified forest
                                       company would optimize their expenses by an effective economic analysis being incorporated
                                       into the management plan. Data on costs, productivity, and efficiency of the forest
                                       management are supposed to be collected and analyzed by FSC-certified forest companies.
                                       This is expected to result in high profitability and economic sustainability that
                                       would also contribute to stabilizing the local economy. As a theoretical result, income
                                       opportunities for the local population are enhanced by getting the chance of an employment
                                       in the forestry sector and the possibility to increase incomes of forest workers by
                                       negotiating with their employers. The illegal use of natural resources would be banned
                                       under FSC.

                                    <p id="d1e1681">The changes to contributing factors by FSC are assumed to initiate a strong and positive
                                       influence on 45%, and a weak and positive influence on 30%, of the identified threats.
                                       All of the strategically least relevant threats are anticipated to have a stong influence
                                       in a positive way (Figure <a href="#Fig12">12</a>).
                                       
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e1686">Half of the threats believed by the participants to be strategically relevant, in
                                       theory, are, likely to be influenced by FSC in a weak and positive way, whilst 17%
                                       are considered to be effected in a strong and positive way. For each of the targeted
                                       threats, threat-reduction-results are formulated (Annex 6). Only one of the threats,
                                       namely <i>“Gathering of forest litter”</i>, is assumed to be negatively influenced due to the diversification and optimal use
                                       of forest that increases the collection of forest residues. A strong and positive
                                       influence is postulated for 60% of the identified threats. The strong and positive
                                       influence of FSC is assumed to mitigate all identified threats leading to large-scale
                                       tree cover loss. In theory, the strong positive influence of FSC would reduce the
                                       size of clear-cut patches and also decrease the percentage of clear-cuttings, prevent
                                       logging in HCVF, reduce the deterioration of soil quality, avert the change of soil
                                       composition and hydro melioration, lower the excess of allowed cut during selective
                                       logging, induce selective logging without damaging trees, and foster a more sustainable
                                       use of non-timber forest products. Potentially, the identified negative impacts of
                                       infrastructure on the forest ecosystem induced by the construction of new roads and
                                       bridges would be slightly reduced. Moreover, the weak and positive influence of FSC
                                       requirements would reduce the overexploitation of timber resources and encourage negotiations
                                       as well as agreements between the certified forest company and communities about the
                                       location of pastures. Moreover, changes in the hydrological regime are supposed to
                                       be avoided, and water quality would be maintained.

                                    <p id="d1e1691">The anticipated reduction of perceived threats to the forest environment is estimated
                                       to reduce almost half of all identified stresses (Annex 7). Most of the stresses are
                                       anticipated to be moderately reduced. The three most relevant stresses are expected
                                       to be influenced in a weak and positive way (Figure <a href="#Fig13">13</a>).

                                       influence of FSC. The presumed reduction of tree cover loss in HCVF, key habitats,
                                       and representative samples of ecosystems would contribute to a loss of habitat for
                                       forest-dwelling species in general, but forest operations and habitat degradation
                                       would continue elsewhere within the concession.

                                    <p id="d1e1702">FSC certification does not specifically require the restoration of degraded forests.
                                       The homogeneity and loss of forest diversity are assumed to be reduced by the promotion
                                       of smaller and fewer clear-cuts, and retaining mature and old trees in primary forests
                                       under the FSC regime. The potential for regeneration in logged forests is supposed
                                       to be improved by supporting natural rejuvenation and retention of seed-trees. The
                                       extinction of vulnerable species and the disturbance of forest fauna would be possibly
                                       reduced where rare, threatened and endangered species and their habitats are identified
                                       and where protection or restoration measures are implemented. The intensity of flooding
                                       is supposed to be reduced by retaining or restoring riparian vegetation. The quality
                                       of water would improve thanks to reduced pollution after FSC-certification.

                                       threat <i>“Extreme weather events”</i>, are supposed to be impacted by forest management operations and could potentially

                                       analysis. The specific FSC criterion 4.3 (<i>“The rights of workers to organize and voluntarily negotiate with their employers

                                 carried out on the effectiveness of FSC in that compliance with FSC standards has
                                 the potential to influence substantially most activities associated with commercial
                                 forestry [<a href="#R56">56</a>]. Previous assessments on the effectiveness of FSC using interviews and questionnaires
                                 concluded there was a positive ecological benefit to forest biodiversity and ecosystem
                                 integrity from FSC [<a href="#R57">57</a>]. In our conceptual model of the Arkhangelsk Region, a considerable proportion of
                                 contributing factors relating to forest management, including monitoring and evaluation
                                 but also the institutions’ capacity and knowledge, were assumed to be transformed
                                 towards the better by FSC. Consequently, following the theory of change, FSC has the
                                 potential to reduce a range of anthropogenic threats such as large-scale deforestation,
                                 logging in HCVF and intact forests, large clear-cuts, excessive AAC, tree damage,
                                 and hydrological changes. However, the reduction of human-induced forest fires was
                                 assumed to be the only stress abated effectively.
                                 
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e1785">The semi-quantitative evaluation of the FSC-induced influence, as estimated during
                                 the theoretical plausibility analysis, suggests that FSC could produce even more effective
                                 outcomes for biodiversity by targeting identified problems more specifically and precisely
                                 in order to generate a strong and positive influence on relevant drivers of negative
                                 environmental impacts. Quite a few FSC-induced measures seem to induce rather minor
                                 improvements. For instance, the concept of safeguarding biodiversity by adopting a
                                 ‘set-aside’ area such as HCVF is in contrast to more contemporary thinking that advocates
                                 the ecosystem-based approach targeting functional landscape ecosystems rather than
                                 small even though representative patches. The protection of parts of commercially
                                 used forests with high conservation values and key biotopes by FSC is important for
                                 biodiversity conservation in Russia [<a href="#R58">58</a>]. However, the size and quality of HCVF were found to be much more related to the
                                 scale and type of tenure but were also regarded as a means of demonstrating compliance
                                 with existing legislation for designated protected species, and not for maintaining
                                 or promoting ecosystem function [<a href="#R59">59</a>]. A more in-depth analysis and evidence-based study is recommended to determine the
                                 effectiveness of current HCVF in reducing biodiversity loss and maintaining ecosystem
                                 functionality, especially in the boreal zone. More specific guidance for forest managers
                                 on the control and restoration of habitats, including riparian vegetation and wildlife
                                 corridors is strongly recommended.

                              <p id="d1e1793">A key finding is that the participatory situation analysis does not entirely match
                                 with findings gathered from the spatial analyses and field visitations. According
                                 to the conceptual model developed by the workshop participants, large-scale clear-cuts
                                 present a key problem of unsustainable forestry practices in the region. Apart from
                                 fragmenting habitats and reducing populations of organisms, this creates massive impacts
                                 on soil and hydrology, leads to large-scale land cover change and is likely to change
                                 micro- and mesoclimate. The clear-cuts do not resemble large-scale natural disturbance
                                 such as forest fires. Fires do not lead to almost complete loss of biomass and nutrients,
                                 and do not mechanically change the soils – as industrialized timber mining does. FSC
                                 PCI would encourage small-scale, close to nature practices of harvesting that would
                                 mimic natural gap dynamics in boreal forests. This is not supported by the spatial
                                 analysis and site visits, which indicated substantial clear-cuts of 50 hectares or
                                 more, after a few years covering much larger areas of consecutively cleared forest.
                                 The conventional ‘checkerboard’ clear-cutting continues even after certification,
                                 and clearly progresses into IFL as shown for the example area. The loss of tree cover
                                 under certification appears to increase over time in response to a greater up-take
                                 of certification by commercial companies operating in the field. Our analysis does
                                 not suggest that FSC certification promotes large-scale clear-cutting in primary forests,
                                 but equally, there is no evidence for either a decrease or avoidance of large-scale
                                 degradation of forest cover in certified areas. Theoretically, deviations observed
                                 from expected outcomes can also be related to an incomplete implementation of FSC
                                 criteria and indicators. This would be corrected during the audits. Indeed, more than
                                 half of the so called corrective action requests (CAR) that were raised during FSC
                                 audits were related to environmental issues [<a href="#R60">60</a>]. However, the key problem of large-scale clear-cuts in primary forests seems to
                                 be compliant with the Russian standard which gives reasons for serious concerns.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e1798">The continued practice of large-scale clear-cuts has far reaching consequences for
                                 the forest environment. In particular, it causes long-term degradation to soils and
                                 the hydrological regime, and also affects local climatic conditions. The complex ecosystem
                                 with its mosaic of mires, peats, and water systems contributes substantially to the
                                 resilience of the planet, specifically, they contribute to the global temperature
                                 balance [<a href="#R61">61</a>] and store huge amounts of carbon [<a href="#R62">62</a>]. However, the boreal is also a deeply vulnerable ecosystem, responding rapidly to
                                 human disturbance. Most of the fires in recent times can be attributed to human activity,
                                 and also the change in fire frequency and intensity that threatens the survival and
                                 resilience capability of the boreal zone. Regarding climate change, FSC refers to
                                 the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and whilst certain criteria
                                 target climate change mitigation by restricting forest conversion (6.10), reducing
                                 erosion (6.5), and supporting forest regeneration (6.3 and 8.2), a more specific guidance
                                 on developing and adopting climate change adaptation measures is urgently needed to
                                 foster sustainable development and to ensure the provision of ecosystem services by
                                 the boreal forest of the Arkhangelsk Region in the long-term. The findings of our
                                 spatial analysis are in line with recent studies from other continents that found
                                 no or very limited effects of certification on halting tree cover loss [<a href="#R18">18</a>, <a href="#R48">48</a>, <a href="#R63">63</a>, <a href="#R64">64</a>]. Especially in the case of poor forest governance, forest certification alone cannot
                                 limit deforestation [<a href="#R65">65</a>].

                              <p id="d1e1827">The theoretical plausibility analysis revealed that FSC is able to address various
                                 elements critical for the effective functioning of forest ecosystems in the Arkhangelsk
                                 Region. However, any perceived benefits on forest management were, according to the
                                 theoretical assessment, deemed to be weak and likely to result in ineffective outcomes
                                 for safeguarding biodiversity and ecosystem services in the long-term. An ecosystem-based
                                 forest management, which is specially tailored to the present situation, is highly
                                 recommended, under certification or not. The postulated success in reducing identified
                                 environmental threats and stresses through a smaller size of clear-cuts, more selective
                                 logging, and harvesting in secondary forests needs further investigation and evidence
                                 on the ground, including additional spatial analysis.

                              <p id="d1e1829">Sustainability standards that are unable to translate principles into effective action
                                 with measurable outputs will fail in meeting intended objectives of safeguarding the
                                 environment and securing human well-being. The discrepancy between the guidance provided
                                 by the PCI and its interpretation by certification bodies and the implementation on
                                 the ground are noted even within the FSC itself [<a href="#R13">13</a>]. Inevitably, the setup of certification systems reflects the philosophy and expertise
                                 of its designers [<a href="#R66">66</a>]. In the case of FSC, the three chamber system was designed to balance ecological,
                                 economic and social impacts of certification. Actually, this is not compatible with
                                 an ecosystem approach that accepts that humans and their activities are dependent
                                 components of the ecosystem, which therefore must be kept functional by all means.
                                 Recent FSC decisions on rejecting ‘Motions’ such as the “Landscape Approach to Protect
                                 Intact Forest Landscapes at the Landscape Level” (Motion GA2017/17, FSC 2017) at the
                                 general assembly 2017 in Vancouver, Canada, give the impression that the development
                                 of relevant ecological issues can easily be outvoted by one of the other chambers
                                 [<a href="#R67">67</a>].

                              <p id="d1e1840">The modus operandi of FSC based on the development of national interpretations of
                                 the global principles and criteria seems to provide a solid fundament for creating
                                 an effective, regionally adequate sustainability standard. But there is no evidence
                                 that beyond the audits of certified companies or concessions, FSC systematically compiles
                                 overarching assessments on certification effectiveness for further development of
                                 the various national standards. The franchising-like approach, where a good part of
                                 the responsibility for the national standards is delegated to national experts influenced
                                 by the corresponding conceptual and legal frameworks, does not allow for consistency
                                 and credibility of the standard. The simple fact that, according to the Russian FSC
                                 standard (and legislation), it seems to be acceptable to exploit primeval forests
                                 by creating large-scale clear-cuts, seriously undermines the credibility of FSC.
