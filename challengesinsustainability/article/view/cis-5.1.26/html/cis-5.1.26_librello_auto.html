                              science can change the way planners engage with urban problems on three points: First,
                              that effective standard planning is an illusion, and the crucial task for urban planners
                              should be considering—on a place-based rationale—the long-term consequences of decisions,
                              policies and, technology change. Second,how it is necessary to develop collaborative
                              planning and co-production of knowledge. Third, to build effective actions on the
                              basis of collaborative planning, it is crucial to take first into account how the
                              population and the institutions respond to and resist change. Conversely, this paper
                              shows that urban planning is also a breeding ground for consolidating the theoretical
                              framework of sustainability science, considering that cities can be seen as paragons
                              of both socio-ecological systems and complex adaptive systems—a position that is discussed
                              throughout the article. Bringing sustainability science and urban planning in closer
                              dialogue with each other, to exploit their potential synergies, has not been done
                              sufficiently: It is an important gap in the academic literature that this article
                              aims at filling.</span></div>

                              <p id="d1e81">Addressing urban planning issues usually means confronting countless wicked problems,
                                 which is quite appropriate considering Horst Rittel and Melvin Webber coined urban
                                 planning as “inherently wicked”: Namely, difficult to define, unpredictable, and defying
                                 rational decision-making [<a href="#R01">1</a>]. More recently, Jane Jacobs observed that urban matters are neither rational problems
                                 waiting for solutions, nor a complete chaos, but rather organized complexity: “Problems
                                 which involve dealing simultaneously with a sizeable number of factors which are interrelated
                                 into an organic whole” [<a href="#R02">2</a>]. Unlike tame problems, which lend themselves to resolution through clear definition
                                 and clear indicators and data, wicked problems challenge the very idea that it is
                                 possible to produce authoritative knowledge [<a href="#R03">3</a>, <a href="#R04">4</a>, <a href="#R05">5</a>]. In fact, wicked problems are characterized by multiple conflicting and equally
                                 valid scientific and social solutions [<a href="#R06">6</a>, <a href="#R07">7</a>]. One of the core reasons why urban planning generates wicked problems is because
                                 it addresses decision-making in a context involving different socio-economic, political
                                 and biophysical systems and actors [<a href="#R08">8</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e108">Sustainability science deals with the same kind of wicked problems. As a problem-driven
                                 endeavor addressing the boundaries and interactions between human and natural systems
                                 [<a href="#R09">9</a>, <a href="#R10">10</a>], sustainability science is pervaded with contested values and as such generates
                                 wicked problems of its own for three major reasons [<a href="#R11">11</a>, <a href="#R12">12</a>]. First, disagreement on the nature of the problem to solve is not uncommon in sustainability
                                 science, since the sustainability of a place may compromise that of others, as observed
                                 by Anthony Jakeman [<a href="#R13">13</a>]. Second, it is likely that sustainability science will never reach consensus regarding
                                 dynamics of complex systems [<a href="#R14">14</a>], due to the pervasive existence of unstated value preferences [<a href="#R15">15</a>] and to the difficulty in incorporating values through deliberation and collective
                                 consideration of issues and answers [<a href="#R16">16</a>]. As observed by Peter Balint, arguments in the context of environmental wicked problems
                                 are often framed around scientific uncertainty while the real issue is disagreement
                                 on values [<a href="#R17">17</a>]. And third, it proves tricky to incorporate scientific knowledge into decision-makers'
                                 decisions and vice-versa [<a href="#R18">18</a>]. Confronting and integrating values and knowledge from different stakeholders, in
                                 a context of high uncertainty and no “blueprint solutions” as observed by Arnim Wiek
                                 is not an easy task [<a href="#R19">19</a>]. All these characteristics can also be applied to urban planning. A good example
                                 combining how planning and sustainability science issues may foster together wicked
                                 problems is the biofuel debate. The efforts made to push the opportunities for fossil-free
                                 fuels are backfiring: How do you decide on the sustainability of biofuel? Its development
                                 may contribute to widening of social injustice and poverty, as staple foods become
                                 economically inaccessible due to scarcity, since biofuel absorbs the largest part
                                 of land and crops [<a href="#R20">20</a>]. As William Rees puts it in a unique and humorous style: “Human (un)sustainability
                                 is a truly wicked problem” [<a href="#R21">21</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e151">The difficulties in adequate decision-making of wicked problems are often tied to
                                 social and political factors such as the public understanding or the politicization
                                 of data [<a href="#R22">22</a>]. Wicked problems are most likely to yield when all the stakeholders and concerned
                                 people come together [<a href="#R23">23</a>]. But even then, the possibility of scientific, social and political consensus on
                                 the course of an action is unlikely due to conflicting interpretations of what the
                                 real problem is and what its causes are [<a href="#R24">24</a>], which may vary a lot with the different values and interests of the actors. It
                                 means that defining a wicked problem is inherently value-laden [<a href="#R25">25</a>, <a href="#R26">26</a>]. In such a situation, the planner plays a dual role of both participant and observer
                                 of the procedures [<a href="#R27">27</a>]. As put beautifully by Jan Gehl, the actual value of a street far exceeds its assets
                                 such as pavement, traffic lights, benches, streetlights etc. [<a href="#R28">28</a>]. The services it provides to the economy and the urban society are much more important.
                                 So city street planning is all but a technical issue concerning road widths or traffic
                                 light control. In fact it is a rather political issue, an answer to the following
                                 question: Who and what should take priority on the city's crowded streets? In this
                                 perspective street planning is typically a wicked problem: If one user group wins—by
                                 designing a new pedestrian crossing for example—another group may lose—the local stores
                                 nearby the pedestrian crossing may face slower delivery times and the residents be
                                 exposed to more noise. Therefore, designing a city street planning that allows moving
                                 and living, efficiently and equitably, for all citizens is a tricky issue.

                              <p id="d1e175">We can distinguish with Sybille Van den Hove what can be called “science for action”
                                 and “science for science” [<a href="#R29">29</a>]. Within such a typology, sustainability science—a use-inspired and issue-driven
                                 approach aiming at the creation knowledge for decision-making in sustainable development—is
                                 clearly “science for action” [<a href="#R30">30</a>], as is urban planning. Both address “real-world” problems and share the necessity
                                 to build a “new social contract with science…that would more adequately address the
                                 problems of the current century” to quote Jane Lubchenco [<a href="#R31">31</a>]. While the methodological framework of sustainability science is still not consolidated,
                                 Rob Swart and his colleagues clearly identify challenges for sustainability science
                                 (Figure 2 in [<a href="#R32">32</a>]). The last one—namely, linking science with policies and action through stakeholder
                                 participation—is crucial. As put by Pim Martens, the methods required for sustainability
                                 science should be participatory, subjective, exploratory and uncertain [<a href="#R33">33</a>]. The point is developing in the stakeholders an interest in being part of the research
                                 process and to explore solutions [<a href="#R34">34</a>, <a href="#R35">35</a>], which entails a strong sense of ownership about the problems they are supposed
                                 to solve [<a href="#R36">36</a>, <a href="#R37">37</a>]. Here too, when trying to foster participatory policies or action research, urban
                                 planning and sustainability science shares the same concerns [<a href="#R38">38</a>]. The research process itself is likely to be twisted and contested on a regular
                                 basis by both the scientists and the other stakeholders for two main reasons. First,
                                 because there is nothing like value-free science: Every actor has its own specific
                                 interests to defend [<a href="#R39">39</a>, <a href="#R40">40</a>]. Second, because—to quote William Rees again—people are usually not conscious that
                                 they are “acting out of various socially constructed beliefs and ideologies acquired
                                 automatically simply by growing up in a particular culture” [<a href="#R41">41</a>], which makes dialogue difficult.

                              <p id="d1e218">A further connection between sustainability science and urban planning lies in the
                                 fact that,over the last twenty years, sustainability has progressively become a landmark
                                 for urban planning, leading to the emergence of so-called sustainability planning
                                 [<a href="#R42">42</a>, <a href="#R43">43</a>]. Many of the wicked problems that cities face are actually related to sustainability
                                 issues, or to issues concerning risk, vulnerability and tipping-points, three topics
                                 typically addressed by sustainability science [<a href="#R44">44</a>, <a href="#R45">45</a>, <a href="#R46">46</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e235">Take, for example, the case of Ponka City in Oklahoma, where the inhabitants incriminated
                                 a nearby coal plant in an excessive amount of fine black dust in the air [<a href="#R47">47</a>]. The state Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) investigated and finally stated
                                 that there was no problem. Unsatisfied with this answer the City Hall brought lawsuits,
                                 which eventually prevailed: It appeared that the procedure used by the DEQ mentioned
                                 that dust crossing the property line of the plant had to be “physically seen”, which
                                 obviously, is almost unfeasible. The verdict imposed to change the procedure from
                                 “physically seen” to detecting “clear evidence of fugitive dust crossing the property
                                 line, such as dust on cars”, which is much easier to observe. Only a few months after
                                 the lawsuits, dust in Ponca subsequently reduced. At first sight, this case might
                                 look like a tame problem: Air standards had been established by law and could be controlled
                                 straightforwardly with the help of data and quantified information. But it was not:
                                 The real problem was that the different stakeholders disagreed on what was significant
                                 to determine the quality of air (“physically seen” vs “clear evidence of fugitive
                                 dust crossing the property line”) and this difference took root in different values,
                                 which is typically wicked [<a href="#R48">48</a>]. The DEQ had a positivist “by the book” calculation: “physically seen” concretely
                                 meant a quantitative threshold level of PM2.5 in the air. The City Hall had another
                                 approach that put the focus on the sense of ownership of the inhabitants and their
                                 local perception. What they say is: I can see black dust on my car, in my lawn or
                                 in my house, which degrade my quality of life whether the PM2.5 thresholds are exceeded
                                 or not, and this dust comes from the coal plant. This case shows that divergences,
                                 in the perception of a resource or a nuisance by different stakeholders, can result
                                 in the emergence of a wicked environmental problem as mentioned by Colleen Hiner in
                                 the case of rural-urban water fights in California [<a href="#R49">49</a>].

                              <p id="d1e246">There is a strong pressure on the urban planner to provide solutions to complex problems
                                 in a general context of uncertainty and permanent political, economic, social and
                                 environmental change [<a href="#R50">50</a>]. It is really challenging since there is often no “right” answer, and all solutions
                                 usually look messy from an exterior point of view [<a href="#R51">51</a>, <a href="#R52">52</a>]. But still, the planner has no latitude to be ”wrong”, since he/she is liable for
                                 the consequences of his actions: It is a paradox. To cope with this fundamental paradox,
                                 many methodological frameworks have been designed, such as transactive planning [<a href="#R53">53</a>], learning networks [<a href="#R54">54</a>], deliberative planning [<a href="#R55">55</a>], community-based participatory research and community-based planning [<a href="#R56">56</a>], communicative rationality [<a href="#R57">57</a>, <a href="#R58">58</a>], or collaborative planning [<a href="#R59">59</a>]. But finally, addressing urban problems is all about trying to provide answers to
                                 questions like: What is a city? How could we represent it so as to address effectively
                                 the wicked problems it generates [<a href="#R60">60</a>]?

                              <p id="d1e282">Sustainability science puts a special focus on understanding the behavior of social-ecological
                                 systems—in the sense of Elinor Ostrom [<a href="#R61">61</a>]—to multiple, cascading and interacting perturbations [<a href="#R62">62</a>]. Similarly, a growing number of scientists in urban planning propose to consider
                                 cities as complex adaptive systems to deal with problems encompassing multiple and
                                 interacting scales, levels, dynamics and actors [<a href="#R63">63</a>, <a href="#R64">64</a>, <a href="#R65">65</a>]. Can we sensibly consider cities as a particular type of social-ecological systems?
                                 This is what is examined now.

                                    <p id="d1e305">Urban planning research tirelessly tries to identify the nature of the cities [<a href="#R66">66</a>, <a href="#R67">67</a>, <a href="#R68">68</a>]. It is the planner's curse—a Sisyphean task indeed. The idea that cities and urban
                                       areas could be considered as complex systems took shape in the sixties from two standpoints.
                                       On one side, Eugene Odum in his seminal book “The Strategy of Ecosystem Development”,
                                       describes the urban areas as ecosystems [<a href="#R69">69</a>]. Continuing in this vein, many authors later described cities as ecological systems
                                       with both biological and technological metabolisms [<a href="#R70">70</a>, <a href="#R71">71</a>, <a href="#R72">72</a>]—one of the more famous being Wackernagel and Riess's book “Our Ecological Footprint”
                                       [<a href="#R73">73</a>]. On the other side, many authors remarked that the general system theory from Ludwig
                                       Van Bertalanffy [<a href="#R74">74</a>] combined well with Norbert Wiener's Cybernetics [<a href="#R75">75</a>] and Warren Weaver's organized complexity [<a href="#R76">76</a>]; providing a conceptual framework to represent the structure and functioning of
                                       the city. In this period, the big trend in social and human sciences was applying
                                       cybernetics to urban planning [<a href="#R77">77</a>, <a href="#R78">78</a>].
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e348">In the late seventies and in the eighties, two linked visions of cities as systems
                                       were encapsulated in two metaphors: The machine metaphor, usually associated with
                                       rigid urban projects, and hub and spoke transport models—which eventually generated
                                       dysfunctional social design, ineffective land use, pollution and congestion—and the
                                       organic one, built in analogy to organisms. Two more visions emerged: The first one
                                       considered cities as social-economic systems, as developed by Jane Jacobs [<a href="#R79">79</a>]; the second one, supported by Manuel Castells, primarily saw cities as networks
                                       for information exchange [<a href="#R80">80</a>]. But beyond their diversity, all these visions emphasized the five characteristics
                                       that distinguish whatever system as demonstrated by Irene Sanders: Namely heterogeneity,
                                       interconnection, scaling, circular causality, development and change over time [<a href="#R81">81</a>].
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e359">Later, urban planners and scientists began to realize that cities could not be modeled
                                       as equilibrium systems changing smoothly and progressively. Discontinuous and chaotic
                                       change reigned everywhere in urban areas [<a href="#R82">82</a>]. New structures and behaviors emerged constantly, in an unpredictabe way, within
                                       cities. A consequence of this new insight is that urban planners started focusing
                                       on how emergent patterns could be generated in the city, by examining how people make
                                       decisions—or even micro-decisions—and how local actions confront and aggregate into
                                       global patterns [<a href="#R83">83</a>, <a href="#R84">84</a>]. To do so, it proved necessary to consider cities not only as systems, but as complex
                                       adaptive systems [<a href="#R85">85</a>, <a href="#R86">86</a>].
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e376">Mitchell Waldrop explains in his key book “Complexity—The Emerging Science at the
                                       Edge of Order and Chaos”, that complex adaptive systems can learn from experience
                                       and change accordingly [<a href="#R87">87</a>]: The constituent agents of these systems are constantly adapting to each other and
                                       to external perturbations so that the system as a whole is prone to self-organization
                                       [<a href="#R88">88</a>]. New structure and new functions emerge — a mechanism traditionally referred to
                                       as “emergence” [<a href="#R89">89</a>]. The idea of self-organization has been applied to the spatial evolution of urban
                                       systems since the nineties [<a href="#R90">90</a>, <a href="#R91">91</a>]. Two characteristics of complex adaptive system is of significant importance to
                                       urban planning: Simple decisions made by individuals aggregate to give rise to complex
                                       global patterns, and each agent is co-evolving with the structure resulting from the
                                       actions of all the others; change stays dormant up to a tipping point at which these
                                       systems flip dramatically and irreversibly into a different state, which is almost
                                       impossible to predict. Many irreversible futures are possible.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e393">The agents that interact in the complex adaptive systems of the cities are social
                                       and biophysical by nature. From this point of view, can they be considered as social-ecological
                                       systems, also called social-environmental systems, or still coupled human-environment
                                       systems [<a href="#R92">92</a>]? Many authors consider that cities should be treated as such [<a href="#R93">93</a>, <a href="#R94">94</a>]. Marina Alberti showed that it is impossible to explain how human societies can
                                       be integrated in the ecological systems of a city, except by considering the city
                                       as a social-ecological system [<a href="#R95">95</a>]. Nancy Grimm calls for incorporating “human decisions, culture, institutions and
                                       economic systems” in the cities [<a href="#R96">96</a>]. In some way, her approach is echoed in the field of urban political ecology: Erik
                                       Swingedouw highlights the circulation and metabolism of nature in urban areas, the
                                       role of history in producing them, and how this production drives, and is driven,
                                       by unequal power relationships, economic inequities, and competing knowledge [<a href="#R97">97</a>].

                                    <p id="d1e414">Even if the exact nature of social-ecological systems is still open to debate—the
                                       Resilience Alliance describes them in the very vague terms of “complex, integrated
                                       systems in which humans are part of nature” [<a href="#R98">98</a>]—their features are well delineated. What differentiates social-ecological systems
                                       from non-human complex adaptive systems is—as mentioned by Frances Westley—that the
                                       former deals with humans who apprehend their world through abstract thought [<a href="#R99">99</a>]. This symbolic construction is based on the ability to use language and symbols,
                                       to communicate across space and time. It has to do with the capacity of human beings
                                       to learn from the past, imagine the future, and finally materialize these thoughts
                                       in technologies, in new types of entities that only exist in the noosphere (institutions,
                                       political and economic structures, as well as values, norms and beliefs).

                                       and more specifically to change the way planners engage with urban sustainability
                                       issues. Conversely urban planning can also be a breeding ground to consolidate the
                                       theoretical framework of sustainability science, since cities can be seen as paragons
                                       of both socio-ecological systems.

                                    <p id="d1e435">Nothing is more vulnerable to rapid emergence and potential chaos than cities [<a href="#R102">102</a>]. Thus, it is crucial for urban planning to learn how to adapt and deal with change
                                       and surprise, while avoiding changes that would threaten the life-supporting capacity
                                       of the city. The tricky issue is to strike a balance between nurturing change and
                                       maintaining the conditions that keep the system within the actual stability regime.
                                       Striking such a balance supposes to acknowledge that uncertainty and unpredictability
                                       are characteristic of cities and require adaptive planning. Addressing such problem
                                       requires learning from, working with and anticipating the dynamics within the social-ecological
                                       system of the city, which is precisely a major target of sustainability science: What
                                       determines the functional integrity and resilience of social-ecological systems? What
                                       are the networks of relationships between the different scales? What do we know about
                                       the critical variables to describe the stability range within which we want to keep
                                       the systems? These are three key issues that sustainability science address according
                                       to Robert Kates, [<a href="#R103">103</a>] and that should help in urban planning.

                                    <p id="d1e443">Transposed into the world of urban planning, sustainability science's stress on determining
                                       networks and thresholds, underlines the fact that taking into account behaviors, relations
                                       and resources flowing across the city are of major importance. A practical example
                                       for such an approach is the BRIDGE decision support-system, which aims at connecting
                                       analytical tools with sustainability appraisal in different study sites in Europe
                                       (Firenze, Helsinki, Gilwice), so as to adapt urban planning interventions on the basis
                                       of material flow data and socioeconomic criteria [<a href="#R104">104</a>, <a href="#R105">105</a>]. But to do this, the planner should not only aim at obtaining information from multiple
                                       sources (such as scientists, stakeholders, practitioners, local communities, etc.),
                                       but also to accept that addressing the complexity of urban dynamics can only be achieved
                                       through co-production of knowledge with all the actors involved in the actions they
                                       plan. Such an approach goes beyond participatory planning since the knowledge and
                                       understanding of all the actors about the social-ecological system of the city nurtures
                                       the entire planning process.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e451">For a long time, traditional urban planning considered only cause-effect relationships
                                       (i.e. housing needs and land-value), or used stochastic modeling to decide on amenities
                                       such as schools, parks or hospitals. Naturally, this often resulted in adverse effects
                                       on the urban fabric. This type of planning was endlessly providing solutions to problems
                                       “easily definable”, but only apparently, and then solving the news problems created
                                       by theses solution. For example, creating sustainable neighborhoods and ecodistricts
                                       often entails the emergence of new environmental and social injustice, as mentioned
                                       by Elizabeth Burton, UK [<a href="#R106">106</a>] and François Mancebo, France [<a href="#R107">107</a>]. The reason is simple: The number of ecological dwellings is limited and their attractiveness
                                       is strong, which increases the rent rate and the sell rate. Such a dynamic quickly
                                       becomes toxic for the urban fabric. It is a real problem: Stephan Wheeler [<a href="#R108">108</a>] underlines, rightly so, that for a city to move toward sustainability, it is essential
                                       to increase both affordable housing and energy efficient buildings. The lesson here
                                       is that—as mentioned by Marco Verweij and Michael Thompson—when too much emphasis
                                       is put in problem identification and solution, it usually ends in unintended negative
                                       outcomes [<a href="#R109">109</a>].
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e465">As a matter of consequence, urban planning should be less about how to find solutions
                                       to pre-determined problems, than understanding the dynamics that give rise to desirable
                                       and undesirable phenomena: planning has to move from a prescriptive activity to a
                                       process of learning and adaption. It entails collaborative process engaging communities,
                                       professionals and other stakeholders with urban planners. Workshops, joint fact-finding
                                       and public forums, may help fostering synergistic urban lifestyles that are desirable,
                                       attainable, maintainable and reproducible—realizing what is usually called “meta design
                                       planning” [<a href="#R110">110</a>]. An example: Sustainability science researchers from Arizona State University (ASU)
                                       led, together with various stakeholders and actors from Phoenix (city officials, business
                                       representatives, community organizations, citizens etc.), a study to develop transition
                                       strategies for sustainability that could be incorporated into the updated General
                                       Plan—city's most important guide for long-term planning. Another objective of the
                                       project was to familiarize administrative staff and citizens across Phoenix with sustainability
                                       and anticipatory governance in urban planning [<a href="#R111">111</a>]. By integrating interactive participatory settings (public hearings, workshops,
                                       coaching sessions, and conferences), the project facilitated negotiations and reconciled
                                       the different stakeholders values and preferences, all of which resulted in a set
                                       of five sustainability-oriented intervention and transition strategies for Phoenix
                                       [<a href="#R112">112</a>].
                                       Co-production of knowledge is particularly relevant when coping with the Gordian knot
                                       of justice—a crucial and well-worn issue in urban planning. Besides, the notion of
                                       justice resonates strongly with sustainability [<a href="#R113">113</a>]: From a normative perspective, everyone concerned by sustainability issues should
                                       be involved in the process of decision-making [<a href="#R114">114</a>]; from a strategic perspective, common people have values and knowledge that are
                                       out of reach of experts, scientists or elected representatives, and may prove essential
                                       to effective sustainability decision-making [<a href="#R115">115</a>]. Maximizing wide-scale involvement in urban planning improves justice, which is
                                       to be expected since it is impossible to define justice independently from its social
                                       context [<a href="#R116">116</a>, <a href="#R117">117</a>]. According to Susan Fainstein, urban planning—be it sustainable or not—should strive
                                       for outcomes only [<a href="#R118">118</a>].

                                    <p id="d1e498">Building collaborative knowledge and action is anything but obvious. The greatest
                                       difficulty lies in a structural lack of legitimacy both for the process itself and
                                       for its outcomes [<a href="#R119">119</a>]. In the province of Limburg (Netherlands), the results of a transdisciplinary study,
                                       whose objective was to measure and develop sustainability planning, has never been
                                       adopted by the local and regional authorities that sponsored it. The reason given
                                       was that the partners of the civil society who worked within the research team “had
                                       no political mandate for defining sustainable development in this regional context”
                                       [<a href="#R120">120</a>]. Such a situation is not uncommon: When trying to generate knowledge for collective
                                       action, the process and its outcomes often interfere with legitimized procedures and
                                       official politics [<a href="#R121">121</a>, <a href="#R122">122</a>]. In the case presented previously concerning the city of Phoenix, legitimacy issues
                                       proved a major obstacle to the implementation of the long-term sustainability strategies
                                       that had been delineated [<a href="#R123">123</a>]: Since the General Plan of Phoenix was not legally binding to the City Hall and
                                       its administration, the recommendations made by the project dissolved in political
                                       debates.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e515">But there is another important dimension to the problem of legitimacy: It may also
                                       damage the relations between practitioners and elected officials on one side, and
                                       the inhabitants and local communities on the other. In other words, the challenge
                                       is integrating bottom-up processes of knowledge and data collection and top-down agency
                                       [<a href="#R124">124</a>]. This issue can be embodied in two questions: How can a planner know enough about
                                       the lives of local people to propose the best possible policies? How is a community
                                       motivated—or not—to collect its local information and communicate it in a way that
                                       can help planners? The example of the public water points in the city of Pune (India),
                                       developed by Luis Bettencourt, raises the following issue: How is it possible for
                                       a planner to determine how many public water points should be created in a neighborhood
                                       [<a href="#R125">125</a>, <a href="#R126">126</a>]? From the inhabitants' point of view, short distance and easy maintenance is essential,
                                       as well as minimal waiting time, which calls for a large number of points forming
                                       a dense network. Such a choice presents a collateral interest: Smaller groups use
                                       every point, which fosters a stronger sense of responsibility. But how does the planner
                                       know how many points are not too many? He has to learn it from the communities themselves.
                                       The inhabitants are the only ones who know the real limits—not the administrative
                                       limits—of the communities and of the neighborhoods. But they will give the information
                                       only if they perceive that it is in their best interest and if they feel they will
                                       have a seat at the decision-making table. This type of urban planning entails trust,
                                       as well as knowledge issues.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e526">Naturally, nobody says that this “sustainability planning”—as we can coin collaborative
                                       urban planning addressing cities as social-ecological systems [<a href="#R127">127</a>]—will replace completely prescriptive urban planning and master plans, even if scholars
                                       and planners tried [<a href="#R128">128</a>]. The objectives and approaches taken are both different and complementary [<a href="#R129">129</a>, <a href="#R130">130</a>]. Prescriptive planning relies on a rational, comprehensive view of urban development
                                       that emphasizes reliance on the efficiency of technological solutions. But urban strategies
                                       focusing only—for example—on optimization of material flows without considering local
                                       knowledge as well the unpredictability of the city as a complex adaptive system, are
                                       usually hazardous: Perturbations affecting the city, such as extreme natural disasters
                                       or economic crisis, may very well result in lack of service provision, social segregation,
                                       security issues which may eventually threaten the well being of the inhabitants and
                                       lead to the collapse of the city [<a href="#R131">131</a>].

                                    </h3>
                                    <p id="d1e546">Embedding all-actors needs and values in sustainability planning through a collaborative
                                       approach has a big consequence, which further differentiates it from prescriptive
                                       planning: It is impossible to develop standard “one-size-fits-all” or “silver-bullet”
                                       solutions. More generally, no panaceas exist when dealing with social-ecological systems,
                                       to use the words of Elinor Ostrom [<a href="#R132">132</a>]. The solutions always depend on the characteristics of the local communities in
                                       crafting sustainable strategies. They are typically place-based and it is crucial
                                       to build solutions adapting to the local characteristics.

                                    <p id="d1e551">This being said, the search for solutions somewhere could fruitfully learn from the
                                       experience of other places. Such consideration bring us back to the issue of knowledge
                                       building: Sharing examples, procedures and assessments of sustainability planning
                                       cases, so that the sum of the resulting knowledge can be used to understand better
                                       the common ground of urban sustainable development. Comparing and assessing different
                                       places makes sense. Moreover since this type of knowledge building is precisely a
                                       major objective of sustainability science [<a href="#R133">133</a>, <a href="#R134">134</a>]. This way, urban planning can contribute to consolidate the theoretical framework
                                       of sustainability science.

                                    <p id="d1e559">Cities can indeed be considered as ideal places to enact and understand the dynamics
                                       involved in sustainability policies. They concentrate three major components for successful
                                       sustainability: Human population, resource and material use, and economic activity
                                       [<a href="#R135">135</a>]. In this sense cities are not a problem but a solution for a sustainable world.
                                       Two cities potential characteristics show the interest for sustainability science
                                       to have a focus on urban planning. First, the differences in the building compactness
                                       within urban areas and the diversity of the urban fabric converge—providing the introduction
                                       of sustainability policies—to facilitate equitable distribution of amenities on the
                                       one hand, and strong biodiversity on the other. And second, urban multifunctionality
                                       makes it easier to diminish the ecological footprint per capita by reducing energy
                                       and material needs, compared to non-urban areas [<a href="#R110">110</a>].

                              <p id="d1e570">Urban planning can enrich significantly the understanding of social-ecological systems
                                 by sustainability science. Vice-versa, sustainability science provides an effective
                                 approach for urban planning, to engage with the wicked problems presented by cities
                                 by considering them as social-ecological systems. Naturally, that is particularly
                                 true when sustainability urban planning is concerned.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e572">There is something paradoxical when aiming at sustainability, whatever the field.
                                 On the one hand there is a need for radical change (overhauling social-ecological
                                 systems, transforming the values that drive individual actions as well as the organizations).
                                 But on the other hand there is a need to secure social, economic, ecological and political
                                 stability, so as to sustain—literally—short-term livability of the social-ecological
                                 system. As far as sustainability urban planning is concerned, it is possible to assume
                                 with Peter Allen [<a href="#R137">137</a>] that the major issue is finding micro and macro structures which are mutually compatible
                                 and coexist, to form social-ecological systems. And it is all but obvious since—as
                                 mentioned by John Wood and François Ascher— cities are inherently unsustainable [<a href="#R138">138</a>, <a href="#R139">139</a>]: They are the paragon of self-organizing far-from-equilibrium dissipative structures
                                 in the sense of Ilya Prigogine [<a href="#R140">140</a>], and as such are prone to irreversible and sudden changes.
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e586">Urban planners have long addressed chaotic environments and unpredictable emergences,
                                 as well as the tensions and potential conflicts at the intersection of human drivers
                                 and nature drivers that can be coined as “tensions in the dual mandate” [<a href="#R141">141</a>]. These situations are well documented especially the question of the necessary trade-offs,
                                 as in the case of proactive planning [<a href="#R142">142</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e594">But what is new when associating urban planning and sustainability science can be
                                 summarized in three points: First, the understanding that effective standard planning
                                 is an illusion, and that the crucial task for urban planners should be considering—on
                                 a place-based rationale—the long-term consequences of decisions, policies and of technology
                                 change. Second, that to do so it is necessary to develop collaborative planning and
                                 co-production of knowledge, with all the concerned actors. Third, that to build effective
                                 actions on the basis of strategic collaborative planning, it is crucial to understand
                                 first how the population and the institutions respond to and resist change. It is
                                 not enough to have an answer to a problem. What is essential is how the inhabitants
                                 and the institutions adopt these answers; how real communities can translate visions
                                 into interventions. Indeed—it is probably the bigger lesson—inertia to change result
                                 from the interaction of institutions, from the citizens to the local communities,
                                 from the city to all the actors [<a href="#R142">142</a>].
                              </p>
                              <p id="d1e599">The major objective of sustainability urban planning is now to support the critical
                                 structures, functional integrity, and capacity for regeneration of the city, so as
                                 to foster life conditions, to all the communities living there—be they human or not.
