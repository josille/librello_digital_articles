                                 soil fertility management, three projects in Northwest Tanzania aim to provide the
                                 local smallholder community with cooking and sanitation alternatives. The present
                                 study proposes an integrated approach to assess the sustainability of the small-scale
                                 cooking and sanitation technologies. Based on the multi-criteria decision support
                                 approach (MC(D)A), we developed a decision-specific, locally adapted, and participatory
                                 assessment tool: the Multi-Criteria Technology Assessment (MCTA). Pre-testing of the
                                 tailored tool was set up with representatives of Tanzanian and German partners of
                                 case study projects. From a methodological perspective, we conclude that the MCTA
                                 uses a set of relevant criteria to realise a transparent and replicable computational
                                 Excel-tool. The combination of MC(D)A for structuring the assessment with analytical
                                 methods, such as Material Flow Analysis, for describing the performance of alternatives
                                 is a promising path for designing integrated approaches to sustainability assessments
                                 of technologies. Pre-testing of the tool served as a proof-of-concept for the general
                                 design of the method. Future applications and adjustments of the MCTA require the
                                 inclusion of end-users, a reasonable and participatory reduction of criteria, and
                                 an increase of feedback loops and group discussions between participants and the facilitator
                                 to support a common learning about the technologies and thorough understanding of
                                 the perspectives of participants.</span></div>

                                    <p id="d1e109">There is broad consensus that—from a global perspective—the excessive use of natural
                                       resources by human beings (in particular the resource consumption of the richer countries)
                                       has manifold consequences [<a href="#R01">1</a>, <a href="#R02">2</a>]. The anthropogenic overexploitation of natural resources results, for example, in
                                       (i) shortages of resources, such as oil, coal, sand, or rock phosphate [<a href="#R03">3</a>], (ii) climate change [<a href="#R04">4</a>], or (iii) decrease of soil fertility [<a href="#R05">5</a>]. By various means, we are crossing the <i>planetary boundaries</i> [<a href="#R06">6</a>]. With respect to biogeochemical flows and genetic diversity, the planetary boundaries
                                       are stressed to such an extent that we risk non-reversible changes of the environment
                                       and even the habitability of the earth. Agriculture, in particular—respectively the
                                       production and use of synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, or seeds—contributes to this
                                       risk [<a href="#R07">7</a>]. How, therefore, can we change the situation? Or, more specifically: How can we
                                       meet the (human) demand for food and energy without overexploiting our planet?
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e136">Recognized recommendations for a <i>sustainable</i> use of resources include, for example [<a href="#R02">2</a>, <a href="#R08">8</a>, <a href="#R09">9</a>, <a href="#R10">10</a>]: (i) establishing circular economies; (ii) using effective, efficient, adapted,
                                       and affordable technologies; and (iii) utilizing locally available resources for soil
                                       fertility management. Measures to establish circular economies comprise <i>inter alia</i> (i) the concept of <i>bioenergy</i>, hence the provision and use of energy from biomass [<a href="#R11">11</a>], respectively renewable resources or organic waste materials, and (ii) the implementation
                                       of <i>ecological sanitation</i> (EcoSan). With the latter, various material flows are collected separately, treated
                                       specifically, and, if possible, ultimately recycled to agricultural land [<a href="#R12">12</a>]. Both topics, bioenergy and EcoSan, are well-studied and have already been brought
                                       into practical applications.

                                       by small-scale farmers [<a href="#R13">13</a>], the sustainability potentials of smallholder communities in the Global South is
                                       of major relevance. In the Northwest of Tanzania (TZ), a representative region for
                                       Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), the main energy carrier is firewood, mostly used for cooking
                                       on a three-stone fire, whilst pit latrines are the most common sanitation approach
                                       [<a href="#R14">14</a>]. This pattern, alongside a steady population growth, increasingly stresses natural
                                       resources such as arable land, aquifers or other water sources, and forests [<a href="#R15">15</a>, <a href="#R16">16</a>].

                                       initiatives have started three projects located in Karagwe, Kagera region, together
                                       with German partners and donors [<a href="#R17">17</a>]. The main objective of the technological development cooperation was to contribute
                                       to <i>sustainable community development</i> by adapting and introducing small-scale and locally <i>adequate</i> cooking and sanitation technologies [<a href="#R18">18</a>]. At the same time, a circular resource economy shall be implemented to improve local
                                       soils and food production. Therefore, residues from cooking and sanitation are used
                                       to increase the recycling of nutrients and the recovery of carbon for restoring soil
                                       humus.

                                       contribute to environmental health by reducing deforestation, climate gas emissions,
                                       and nutrient leaching to aquifers [<a href="#R19">19</a>]. We further showed that using residues from cooking and sanitation could stimulate
                                       the productivity of smallholder farming by improving the acidic and nutrient-depleted
                                       local soil [<a href="#R20">20</a>, <a href="#R21">21</a>]. Subsequently, we widened our perspective to evaluate the technologies studied according

                                    <p id="d1e217">The challenge of any <i>sustainability assessment</i> [<a href="#R22">22</a>] is to translate defined and basically agreed upon principles into an operational
                                       model [<a href="#R23">23</a>]. However, even though measurable criteria can be applied to operationalize sustainability,
                                       it is individuals or societies who evaluate the plausibility and credibility of relevant
                                       assessments. If the process involves multiple actors, differing opinions may also
                                       cause trade-offs between stakeholders. Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) attempts
                                       to address this challenge [<a href="#R24">24</a>, <a href="#R25">25</a>, <a href="#R26">26</a>]. In the first instance, any assessment of alternatives against multiple criteria,
                                       irrespective of who participates in the analysis, can generally be called a Multi-Criteria
                                       Analysis (MCA) [<a href="#R27">27</a>, <a href="#R28">28</a>]. Moreover, MCDA indicates a specific MCA, addressing <i>participatory</i> decision-making processes [<a href="#R29">29</a>]. Both approaches, MCA and MCDA, are applied in planning, decision, and evaluation
                                       processes and to assess likely consequences of decisions [<a href="#R30">30</a>]. In the following, we use the abbreviation MC(D)A when referring to characteristics
                                       of both approaches.

                                    <p id="d1e253">According to [<a href="#R31">31</a>], the MC(D)A is generally suitable for decisions related to sustainable development
                                       because the method is largely transparent, participatory, and inter-disciplinary.
                                       Furthermore, the MC(D)A is often applied in environmental decision making [<a href="#R32">32</a>, <a href="#R33">33</a>] and strategic planning for natural resources management [<a href="#R34">34</a>]. While the number of MC(D)A applications has clearly grown over the last two decades,
                                       the method was mainly applied in scientific communities in the Global North [<a href="#R35">35</a>]. Among the view examples of MC(D)A-studies from SSA are (i) comparisons of different
                                       sanitation approaches in Uganda [<a href="#R36">36</a>] and in Burkina Faso [35], (ii) an assessment of cook stoves in TZ [<a href="#R37">37</a>], and (iii) an evaluation of appropriate farming techniques in TZ [<a href="#R38">38</a>].

                                       from harvest and kitchen residues for cooking; (ii) <i>Efficient Cooking in Tanzania</i> (EfCoiTa), which disseminates advanced designs of improved cook stoves (ICS), such
                                       as microgasifier cook stoves; and (iii) <i>Carbonization and Sanitation</i> (CaSa), which works with EcoSan, including a urine-diverting dry toilet (UDDT), thermal
                                       sanitation of faeces, and composting of human excreta mixed with other organic wastes
                                       including <i>biochar</i>. The latter material is a residue from cooking with microgasifiers. Cooking and sanitation
                                       are connected through the use of residues for soil fertility management, which makes
                                       the energy-sanitation-agriculture nexus even more interesting to study. In prior publications,
                                       we introduced the case studies [<a href="#R17">17</a>] and described the technologies [<a href="#R19">19</a>]. All technologies shall be implemented and used in both, households and institutions
                                       (e.g. in schools or hospitals). The local non-governmental organisation (NGO) <i>Mavuno Project - Improvement for Community Relief and Services</i> (MAVUNO) facilitates the BiogaST- and CaSa-projects. The <i>Programme for Community Habitat Environmental Management</i> (CHEMA) runs the EfCoiTa-project. German project partners are Engineers Without Borders
                                       (EWB) Berlin/Germany and <i>Technische Universität</i> (TU) Berlin. Financing of the projects is provided by German foundations <i>BayWa</i> (BiogaST) and <i>Heidehof</i> (CaSa and EfCoiTa). After completing pilot studies, a strategy and a plan for implementing
                                       technologies in the smallholder community needs to be developed. Hence, the respective
                                       technologies are the subject of decisions at hand. Decision makers are either the
                                       NGOs, implementing the technologies on a project-basis, or single households, purchasing
                                       them, for example, from local manufacturers or at local markets.

                                       participation [<a href="#R34">34</a>]. Aggregation of an assessment is possible from the level of different criteria into
                                       an overall performance of alternatives and, likewise, from the level of individual
                                       preferences into a common, average preference [<a href="#R29">29</a>] (For the interested reader, a summary of the fundamental terms used in MC(D)A can
                                       be found in Table A.1). Based on a comprehensive literature review, especially [<a href="#R23">23</a>, <a href="#R33">33</a>, <a href="#R39">39</a>, <a href="#R40">40</a>, <a href="#R41">41</a>, <a href="#R42">42</a>, <a href="#R43">43</a>] inspired the design of our MC(D)A approach.

                                       specific approaches of the case studies, and ways of using technologies in daily life.
                                       The main activities, therefore, included: participating in projects; short- and long-term
                                       stays in Karagwe; teamwork with project workers; reading project reports, governmental
                                       reports, and non-governmental reports; and communicating with scientists and practitioners
                                       in the region. Based on this, we described the environment of the decision including
                                       <i>driving forces</i> (Table <a href="#Tab01">1</a>) and <i>motivations</i> (Table <a href="#Tab02">2</a>) that represent the objectives of the projects initiators to develop and implement
                                       ‘new’ technologies in the Karagwe smallholder community.

                                       <i>Alternatives</i> to be analysed are either (i) discrete technologies or (ii) a mix of technologies
                                       [<a href="#R39">39</a>]. In the present study, we decided to analyse discrete technologies that are defined
                                       by the case studies (Table <a href="#Tab03">3</a>; cf. Tables A.3–A.5 for pictures and descriptions). Currently, the most common combination
                                       of technologies for cooking and sanitation found in Karagwe smallholdings is a three-stone
                                       fire and pit latrine [<a href="#R14">14</a>]. The alternatives assessed are further technologies that are locally available (i.e.
                                       technically and commercially) for implementation. We compared (i) technologies represented
                                       in the case study projects, and (ii) other widespread alternatives. Regarding the
                                       first point, cooking alternatives include: a system composed of a biogas digester
                                       and a biogas burner, developed and adapted to Karagwe conditions by the BiogaST-project;
                                       and two types of ICSs promoted by the EfCoiTa-project, such as the rocket stove and
                                       the microgasifier. MAVUNO endorses implementation of biogas systems at households
                                       through development cooperation projects whilst CHEMA produces and disseminates rocket
                                       stoves and microgasifiers at their workshop. Sanitation alternatives include to ecological
                                       approaches, namely, “EcoSan” that refers to using an UDDT and “CaSa” that refers to
                                       using the UDDT in combination with a sanitation oven for thermal treatment of excreta
                                       pursuant to the practices of the CaSa-project. MAVUNO is engaged in testing and promoting
                                       both approaches. Regarding the second point, charcoal stoves (also called “charcoal
                                       burners”) are commonly available in Karagwe on markets and from local stove sellers
                                       and a combination of a flush toilet and septic tank can be accessed through local
                                       plumbers. The charcoal and biogas alternative also include the charcoal production
                                       and biogas digester. These processes provide the energy carrier used in households.
                                       Rocket or microgasifier stoves, in comparison, make direct use of firewood or sawdust.
                                       The latter is an available waste resource in many anthropogenic settings.

To identify such criteria, we performed a comprehensive literature review. Our
                                       focus was specifically on comparable work conducted (i) for topics such as bioenergy,
                                       EcoSan, and soil fertility or natural resource management, and (ii) in a regional
                                       context of TZ, East-Africa, or SSA. We further collaborated with practitioners, academic
                                       professionals, and other experts in bioenergy and/or sanitation in an East-African-context.
                                       Activities and methods applied include: (i) semi-structured interviews conducted in
                                       TZ and Uganda; (ii) group discussions based on the <i>world café method</i> [<a href="#R45">45</a>] in TZ and Germany; and (iii) discussion with the coordinator of BiogaST and CaSa
                                       projects (A. Bitakwate) to conclude a final set of criteria.

                                       prepares the tool and descriptions of the alternatives beforehand, and moderates the
                                       assessment process. Stakeholder representatives participate, in particular, in conducting
                                       the <i>weighting</i> of criteria and the <i>scoring</i> of alternatives. According to [<a href="#R23">23</a>], relevant <i>stakeholders</i> that should be considered when conducting a participatory MC(D)A include: (i) funding
                                       agencies; (ii) governmental authorities; (iii) specialists (e.g. stove technicians,

                                    <p id="d1e746">As a consequence, we developed a hand-made and Excel-based assessment tool. The tool
                                       is tailored to our specific application and based on a template of [<a href="#R23">23</a>]. In total, the designed tool comprises sheets for (i) providing information to participants,
                                       (ii) collecting judgments of participants during weighting and scoring, and (iii)
                                       calculating, summarizing, and visualizing results. The latter include so-called <i>Performance Matrices</i> (PM) that summarize weights, scores, and results for each participant and all alternatives.
                                       To elicit individual preferences from participants, we selected applicable methods
                                       for participatory weighting and scoring from [<a href="#R29">29</a>, <a href="#R32">32</a>, <a href="#R39">39</a>]. The weighting further comprises <i>ranking</i> and <i>rating</i> of main- and sub-criteria. Ranking is the ordering of criteria according to individually
                                       perceived importance. Rating means assigning individual numeric weights as points
                                       ranging from 0 to 100 to each criterion in order to differentiate between the criteria.

                                       technologies, we propose a tool called the Multi-Criteria Technology Assessment (MCTA).
                                       We designed the MCTA by adapting MC(D)A and developing a tool, which is adequate for
                                       the sustainability assessment of small-scale cooking and sanitation technologies.
                                       The process included activities as described in Section 2.2. Results with respect

                                       categories of [<a href="#R47">47</a>] with aspects from the Integrated Sustainable Waste Management approach of [<a href="#R48">48</a>] that describes “the enabling environment of sustainability”. Finally, we chose the
                                       following main-criteria as being most relevant: technological-operational, environmental,
                                       health/hygiene, socio-cultural, socio-economic/financial, and political/legal criteria.
                                       Pursuant to [<a href="#R23">23</a>], we use a six-pointed so-called “sustainability star” (Figure <a href="#Fig2">2</a>) to visualise how we define sustainability in the MCTA. Each of the six dimensions
                                       represents one of the six main-criteria and thus reflects an objective of sustainability
                                       that is addressed in the analysis of cooking and sanitation technologies. Furthermore,
                                       the categories “acceptability”, “affordability”, and “reliability” are assigned to
                                       the main-criteria. Derived from Sustainable Development Goal no. 7 of the United Nations,
                                       these indicate characteristics, which feature a sustainable use of energy technologies

                                    <p id="d1e897">Overall, we consider the chosen criteria as significant to systematically identify
                                       strengths and weaknesses of technologies and to assess their sustainability. However,
                                       criteria are not thoroughly independent from each other. Some criteria describe different
                                       objectives even though they are related to each other. For example, two of the technological-operational
                                       criteria are “preferably high use of locally available resources” and “preferably
                                       low use of industrial resources”. Both sub-criteria are related to the socio-economic/financial
                                       criterion “preferably low cost for implementation” because the material use influences
                                       production costs. Another reason for preferring a substantial use of locally available
                                       resources is, however, a higher degree of independence from international markets

                                       applied are intermediate or so-called “means-to-an-end” objectives rather than fundamental
                                       objectives [<a href="#R39">39</a>]. Nevertheless, according to [<a href="#R32">32</a>] this approach is not contradicting the MC(D)A concept.

                                       (MFA) [<a href="#R19">19</a>] also in combination with Soil Nutrient Balancing (SNB) [<a href="#R21">21</a>], was particularly important to describe environmental attributes. The MFA identifies
                                       and quantifies sources, sinks, directions, magnitudes, connections, dependencies,
                                       and shifts of material flows between the anthroposphere and the environment [<a href="#R51">51</a>]. The SNB specifically measures, calculates, and balances various input and output

                                       context was not sufficient to estimate and to describe performances of most technologies.
                                       In order to generate a profound basis for the MCTA, we needed significant additional
                                       efforts and approximately two years for conducting performance tests of the technologies,
                                       elaborating a field trial and MFA and SNB modelling. Hence, describing the performance
                                       of the alternatives was challenging and time-consuming, which resulted in certain
                                       shortcomings of the pre-test.

                                       Value Theory (MAVT) and Simple Additive Weighting (SAW) out of a wide range of existing

                                       to their value. SAW describes the mathematical approach to determine such values through
                                       systematic aggregation.

                                       is done by applying the SWING-method [<a href="#R29">29</a>]; sub-criteria are then simply rated. From the <i>numeric weights</i> (i.e. points ranging from 0 to 100) given by participants during rating, the tool
                                       supports the planner in determining the <i>relative weights</i> of sub- and main-criteria (Equations A.1–A.5). Subsequently, scoring is conducted
                                       for each sub-criterion and each alternative separately. Participants therefore assign
                                       <i>numeric scores</i> in points ranging from <span class="inline-formula">

                                       by indicating a * instead of assigning points, if they consider available information
                                       as insufficient and/or feel unsure about scoring. In offering this *-option, we attempt
                                       to not force participants into an arbitrary judgement.

                                       of single attributes. The tool, therefore, determines the <i>weighted score</i> for each sub-criterion as the product of (calculated) relative weight and (assigned)
                                       score (Equation A.6). Computations are adapted for the *-case as described in the
                                       Appendix (Equations A.4 and A.6). Subsequently, plain addition determines the weighted
                                       scores for each main-criterion (Equation A.7). To deduce the <i>overall value</i> of an alternative, weighted scores are then further aggregated to result in a final
                                       <i>Sustainability Index</i> (SI). The SI is determined for each person (Equation A.8) along with an <i>average SI</i> of all participants for each alternative (Equation A.9).

                                       of results is an essential element of the MCTA. In total, the tool provides the following
                                       visualizations, which are inspired by [<a href="#R23">23</a>]: (i) a colour-coded scatter plot showing the relative weights assigned to main-criteria;
                                       (ii) bar diagrams ranking the alternatives with respect to the average SI; (iii) colour-coded
                                       scatter plots showing the average SI for all alternatives in one graph; (iv) colour-coded
                                       scatter plots showing assessment results on the level of main-criteria; (v) colour-coded
                                       bar diagrams showing the distribution of the SI as the balance of positive and negative
                                       weighted scores on the level of main-criteria; and (vi) a summary of scoring and weighting
                                       results on the level of main-criteria. The latter three types of visualizations summarize
                                       the voting of all participants in one graph for each alternative. The colour-coded
                                       scatter plots indicate assessment results of different stakeholder groups alongside
                                       the mean of all participants in different colours. The first and fourth graphs are
                                       designed by using a net diagram and by arranging the axes that represent main-criteria
                                       according to the sustainability star. The sixth graph visualises connections between
                                       the perceived importance of a certain dimension of sustainability and the assigned
                                       performance of an alternative. The former is indicated by numeric weights assigned
                                       to respective main-criteria plotted on the x-axis and the latter by numeric scores
                                       that an alternative receives for certain main-criteria plotted on the y-axis. The

                                    <p id="d1e1103">We acknowledge that the computational approach of the MCTA is rather simple, however,
                                       in accordance with basic principles of MC(D)A modelling [<a href="#R29">29</a>]. For example, on the one hand, the final single index makes alternatives directly
                                       commensurable [<i>ibid</i>.]. On the other hand, the applied methods, MAVT and SAW, belong to compensatory MC(D)A
                                       techniques [<i>ibid</i>.]. This means that a very bad scoring for one attribute can be compensated by a very
                                       good scoring for another and <i>vice versa</i>. Furthermore, instead of determining specific value functions for each participant,
                                       we assumed linearity. The main reason was to avoid overstraining participants. Furthermore,
                                       the statistical approach is rather simple but viable. As featured by [<a href="#R34">34</a>], who demand a “more transparent, simple, and easily accessible participatory modelling
                                       paradigm and process”, we thus consider the MCTA as a valid methodological extension
                                       of the MC(D)A. Finally, visualisations support communication of results to and between
                                       participants. Graphs are designed so that they can effectively help (i) to reveal
                                       issues that need to be addressed before considering a technology suitable for sustainable
                                       community development, (ii) to identify the specific fields where further improvements
                                       of the technology are needed, and, finally, (iii) to avoid potential project ruptures
                                       in the future.

                                       dimension of sustainability because the environmental main-criterion include many
                                       sub-criteria related to agriculture, and is consequently perceived as highly important
                                       for smallholders. On the contrary, according to [<a href="#R55">55</a>], residents in the vicinity of Arusha/TZ do not consider environment as an important
                                       objective when choosing renewable energy technologies for electrification. Only one
                                       interviewee out of about 40 respondents, who were mainly farmers, addressed an environmental
                                       criterion as an influencing factor to purchase a solar home system [<i>ibid.</i>]. Respondents instead mentioned health and hygiene as the most important objectives
                                       for their families [<i>ibid.</i>].

                                       sanitation system as appropriate, factors such as costs and service quality are most
                                       relevant for participants [<i>ibid.</i>]. Nevertheless, we understand our finding that environmental criteria are most relevant,
                                       by the fact that (i) our study area is a rural area farther away from urban settlements
                                       compared to the study areas of [<a href="#R55">55</a>] or [<a href="#R56">56</a>] and (ii) that many participants in our study are closely related to environmental
                                       settings (e.g. farmers with off-farm income, agricultural technicians, environmental

                                       highest weights are assigned to the technological-operational criterion. For example,
                                       in an assessment of ICSs available on the Tanzanian market, criteria related to the

                                       region, which is recognized by stakeholders, and thus influences their judgements.
                                       National programs for promoting renewable energies and supporting access to such technologies
                                       especially in rural areas of TZ include the Rural Energy Fund, the Rural Energy Agency,

                                       TBDP has not yet chosen or appointed implementation partners in the region. According
                                       to [<a href="#R37">37</a>], Tanzanian standards for cooking technologies are only available for charcoal stoves
                                       whilst existing standards are not enforced. Furthermore, governmental initiatives,
                                       intended to support bioenergy implementation, are not coordinated and, thus, largely
                                       inefficient [<i>ibid.</i>]. With respect to sanitation, [<a href="#R58">58</a>] also criticizes a strong lack of legislation in the sector of non-sewer sanitation
                                       service in TZ.

                                       of their potential to reduce fuel consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

                                    <p id="d1e1334">Interestingly, Tanzanian participants in particular assigned positive scores to the
                                       biogas system and for sub-criteria on GHG-emissions despite the fact that the description
                                       clearly stated that GHG-emissions would <i>increase</i> compared to cooking on a three-stone fire. We reason that Tanzanian stakeholders
                                       are aware of the minor influence of TZ on global GHG-emissions, compared to Germany,
                                       other European countries, or the United States. We further argue that there is a strong
                                       and positive pre-conception of the biogas system as an “environmental-friendly technology”.
                                       Regarding the usability of cooking technologies, all stakeholders participating in
                                       the MCTA agreed that the biogas system performs the worst of all alternatives analysed.
                                       Major problems identified are thereby (i) water requirements for a sound operation
                                       of the digester and (ii) lack of robustness of the system towards changes in climate
                                       conditions and user abuse. Also with respect to costs (including costs for implementation,
                                       operation, and maintenance), the biogas technology is assessed as the most disadvantageous
                                       cooking alternative. To underline scorings of costs, investment costs of locally available
                                       alternatives in Karagwe are as follows: costs for implementing a biogas system are
                                       approximately €1,200 , which makes possessing a biogas digester a substantial investment
                                       for smallholders. In comparison, acquisition costs of charcoal stoves or ICSs range
                                       from 2 to about €25 (cf. Table A.5). Furthermore, [<a href="#R57">57</a>] identify high installation and maintenance costs as key barriers for biogas implementation
                                       in TZ, despite the fact that households are willing to adopt the technology. Hence,
                                       [<a href="#R57">57</a>] conclude that implementing biogas in rural areas requires financial support by national
                                       programs through subsidies and/or loans.

                                       German participants, however, assess these technologies with positive and above-average

                                       of German participants are rather negative and below the average SI, whilst Tanzanians
                                       assess the technology positively and above the average SI. Most prominently, staff
                                       members of CHEMA ascribe the highest positive points to rocket and microgasifier stoves,
                                       which are the cooking technologies that CHEMA disseminates. Likewise, staff members
                                       of MAVUNO rate ICSs with rather negative scores compared to the biogas system, which

                                       functions (Figure <a href="#Fig7">7</a>). Negative assessment results refer, in particular, to the political/legal criterion.
                                       Shortcomings of the septic alternative mainly refer to the environmental, health/hygiene,
                                       and socio-economic/financial criteria.

                                    <p id="d1e1420">Crosschecking our results with literature, the observation that a clearly better socio-economic/financial
                                       performance is assigned to the ecological approaches compared to the septic alternatives,
                                       is in line with [<a href="#R56">56</a>]. For the case of Burkina Faso, [<a href="#R56">56</a>] report that in particular low- and middle-income households perceive the UDDT as
                                       more financially appropriate compared to septic tanks. Strategic thinking, which includes
                                       considering operational costs as an important factor, influences households’ judgements
                                       [<a href="#R56">56</a>]. In contrast, high-income households consider the septic system as more appropriate
                                       compared to the UDDT, because for this social group factors such as service quality
                                       are more important than costs [<i>ibid.</i>]. Farmers in Karagwe belong, however, mainly to low- and middle-income household
                                       groups [<a href="#R14">14</a>]. (Table A.5 summarizes costs of sanitation alternatives.)

                                    <p id="d1e1437">The pre-test further indicated certain doubts about the approaches, in particular
                                       on the sub-criteria “safe working conditions” and “safety in operation through avoiding
                                       risks of infection to users”. In contrast, literature commonly promotes EcoSan as
                                       a <i>safe</i> sanitation alternative because of the multi-barrier approach applied [<a href="#R12">12</a>, <a href="#R59">59</a>]. To our knowledge, there were, however, no instances of sickness during the course
                                       of the CaSa pilot project that ran more than four years. Further investigations might
                                       follow-up this significant observation (cf. Section 4.2.). In total, the performance
                                       of ecological alternatives against the health/hygiene main-criterion is neutral. [-10]Our
                                       finding ultimately supports integrating health/hygiene as criterion when assessing
                                       sanitation technologies. This helps to identify areas of conflict, as shown in our
                                       case. Health/hygiene criteria should, therefore, not be excluded from analyses as
                                       it was, for example, the case in studies by [<a href="#R56">56</a>] or [<a href="#R60">60</a>].

                                    <p id="d1e1454">Furthermore, we find that socio-cultural performances assessed for EcoSan and CaSa
                                       alternatives are comparable to assessment results for the septic system. We attribute
                                       this finding to the practical demonstration of UDDT-technology in the region. On the
                                       contrary, [<a href="#R56">56</a>] identify UDDT as less socio-culturally accepted compared to a septic system and,
                                       therefore, request more alternatives and their advantages and disadvantages before
                                       assessing the technologies. This was exactly the case in the CaSa pilot project’s
                                       course.

                                       For both ecological alternatives, Tanzanian stakeholders assess negatively and below
                                       the average SI, whilst German participants rate the alternatives clearly positive
                                       and above the average SI. In contrast, most German participants assess the septic
                                       alternative as clearly more negative and below the average SI compared to their Tanzanian
                                       fellows. Only for the septic system, the assessments of all participants are rather
                                       homogenous and less differentiated compared to other sanitation technologies. In addition,
                                       the septic alternative receives an average negative SI from all except one participant.
                                       Most prominent is, however, that one German participant, who has been strongly involved
                                       in designing, developing, and testing the CaSa-approach, assigns the highest positive
                                       scores to that sanitation alternative.

                                    <p id="d1e1540">We further learned that the visualisations of results, as integrated part of the MCTA-tool,
                                       are highly supportive to shed light on individual perspectives and valuations of stakeholders
                                       for the assessed alternatives. The visualisations help to make subjectivity in scoring
                                       results transparent. Here, we agree with [<a href="#R40">40</a>] who emphasises that showing stakeholders each other’s preferences is rather one
                                       of the most relevant results of conducting an MC(D)A. The visualisations further allow
                                       for a target-oriented improvement to overcome shortcomings of the technologies. [15]Due
                                       to the low sample size and the high variance we observed in the tool’s pre-test, some
                                       visualization are not discussed thoroughly in this article. They are, however, presented
                                       in the Supplements (cf. Figures S.5–S.8).
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e1545">As other benefits of the MCTA, we concluded that the assessment process promotes collaborative
                                       learning and a better understanding of the technologies assessed. Final feedback revealed
                                       that five out of six participants articulated that the MCTA supported them in forming
                                       their own opinion about the technologies (Figure S.9). Hence, our method reacts on
                                       [<a href="#R61">61</a>] who promote “embedded learning”, that is integrating recent findings and sustainability
                                       assessment. This integration also constitutes an important part of the analytical
                                       tool we developed. Information that is provided to participants during the assessment
                                       process and describe various impacts of the technologies assessed, originate <i>inter alia</i> from recent action research conducted in Karagwe.

                                    <p id="d1e1554">Despite these benefits, we further experienced the challenge of “balancing three tensions:
                                       (i) maintaining scientific credibility, (ii) assuring practical saliency, and (iii)
                                       legitimising the process to multiple participants” [<a href="#R62">62</a>]. In particular, we identify certain limitations referring to (I) the choice of alternatives
                                       and participants, (II) the realised means of participation, (III) time consumption,
                                       communication effort and complexity, and (IV) gender balance.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e1559">(I) Firstly, we acknowledge that technologies mostly applied for the time being, which
                                       are three-stone fire and pit latrine, are not among the alternatives assessed. One
                                       could further criticise the fact that farmers were not involved in the assessment
                                       even though they represent the party most concerned and that the technologies assessed
                                       were developed to improve livelihoods of smallholders. [10]Reasons for conducting
                                       a pre-test of the MCTA-tool with local representatives limited to NGOs’ staff members
                                       are disclosed in Section 2.3. Our proceeding is supported by [<a href="#R63">63</a>] who also recommend establishing intermediaries between research institutions and
                                       farmers when evaluating agricultural projects. Culture and social standing of research
                                       and/or NGOs can inhibit reciprocal communication between researchers and farmers.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e1564">(II) We acknowledge that the MCTA process is not participatory throughout as intended.
                                       This is a consequence of additional empirical data generated and that we faced a conflict
                                       between the scope of the work and the available time budget when actually starting
                                       the pre-test. Hence, we had to adapt the 9-steps-approach. Initially we wanted to
                                       include more feedback loops during the process, for example, in order to discuss experiences
                                       after scoring, and, thereafter, offering participants the opportunity to adapt their
                                       valuations. Moreover, the assessment was conducted separately, meaning that Tanzanian
                                       participants were in TZ and German participants in Germany. This fact results, in
                                       limited insights into the individual perceptions and, thus, inhibits <i>joint</i> understanding and learning of participants.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e1569">(III) We understand that high time consumption is often reported as a problem when
                                       conducting a participatory MC(D)A [<a href="#R38">38</a>, <a href="#R40">40</a>]. Nonetheless, in the final feedback, most participants judged the scope of the MCTA,
                                       defined by time budget, details, number of criteria, clarity of the task, amount of
                                       information, etc., as good and to cope with (Figure S.9). Moreover, extensive communication
                                       (via e-mail and Skype) between the planner and individual participants was required
                                       to identify and solve possible misunderstandings. For example, participants scored
                                       alternatives significantly different although the performance of these alternatives
                                       was described as strongly comparable. Differing backgrounds of participants might
                                       explain this, as well as the problems they faced in understanding all (scientific
                                       and non-scientific) terms used in the descriptions. Participants might also simply
                                       not agree with the description provided, due to contrasting personal experiences and
                                       knowledge. However, because of the decentralized process we applied, it was not possible
                                       to directly address these observations, for example in individual or group discussions.
                                       
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e1577">(IV) Lastly, we acknowledge that we pre-tested the MCTA-tool with in total two females
                                       and eight males; both women <i>white</i> and with academic background. Hence, we failed to reach a gender balance and, in
                                       particular, to include female representatives of Tanzanian partners. We attribute
                                       this shortcoming (i) to choosing English as working language, and (ii) to a general
                                       dominance of men at the level of project coordination and/or management in the participating
                                       NGO communities.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e1582">With regards to differences in stakeholders’ perceptions, our findings are further
                                       in line with [<a href="#R29">29</a>], who state that applying a MC(D)A-approach does not create an objective, unbiased,
                                       and value-free analysis. In a nutshell: individual perspectives and subjective judgements
                                       are “normal”. [-20]It is hence a methodological challenge to make these differences
                                       visible instead of neglecting them. For example, we found that assessments of participants
                                       in the pre-test seem substantially biased towards the technology they promote. Visualizing
                                       these differences expediently is only the first step. The lack of group discussion
                                       (as part of the step 8; cf. Section 2.3.) is a clear shortcoming. For example, we
                                       have no specific insights into <i>why</i> differences exist and which arguments underlie the variations observed. Interpretation
                                       of results (by participants and the authors) is thus largely based on guesswork.

                                    <p id="d1e1590">According to the final feedback, two thirds of participants believe that the MCTA
                                       is also applicable within their community if further adapted (cf. Section 4.3). In

                                       a viable <i>integrated approach</i> to sustainability assessment. On one hand, MC(D)A helps to structure the assessment.
                                       On the other, the integration of results from analytical studies, such as MFA, SNB,
                                       or laboratory analysis, allows for illustrating the performance of alternatives assessed
                                       through semi-quantitative objectives of sustainability, and particularly the environmental
                                       dimension.

                                       and a basic assessment tool. Basic skills in Excel are the main requirement for using
                                       the MCTA-tool. Nevertheless, conducting an MCTA is an extensive process that demands
                                       considerable time budgets and a strong commitment from all participants.
                                    </p>
                                    <p id="d1e1634">To summarize, we conclude that the MCTA is an appropriate and applicable method to
                                       analyse potential effects and interrelations of different cooking and sanitation technologies
                                       on household levels. The method also indicates contradictions with respect to different
                                       sustainability goals. In addition, the MCTA enhances transparency about individual
                                       preferences, values, doubts, and objectives among all participants, respectively stakeholders.

                                       tend to be more enthusiastic about the analysed technologies while representatives
                                       of the Tanzanian partners are more sceptical. This observation holds true especially
                                       for the ICSs technologies, such as microgasifier and rocket stoves, and the EcoSan
                                       and CaSa sanitation alternatives. Technologies that are more common and established
                                       in both countries, such as biogas or septic systems, are assessed more similarly among
                                       participants. Another example for varying assessments is that representatives of the
                                       implementing NGOs and of the technology-developers or scientific partners tend to
                                       favour the alternative that they have supported and accompanied, and, likewise, rate
                                       competing technologies below average.

                                       that the higher the assessors diversity with respect to education, language, class,
                                       and scientific or practical experiences and knowledge, (i) the more difficult the
                                       process because of uncertainties about the common understanding and (ii) the more
                                       important the process and the more interesting the results. Testing this hypothesis
                                       could be subject of future scientific MC(D)A work.

                                    <p id="d1e1655">Pre-testing the MCTA with a choice group of participants can serve as a basic proof-of-concept,
                                       with the method as a simple but viable sustainability assessment tool for the multi-perspective
                                       evaluation of cooking and sanitation alternatives. Hence, we conclude that, by providing
                                       a framework and a tool, the MCTA can effectively support case studies and relevant
                                       strategic planning and decision-making. Moreover, the MCTA is also practicable for
                                       other real-world applications related to small-scale cooking and sanitation technologies,
                                       such as in other regions and/or for other technologies.

                                       firstly, a moderated discussion about the existing catalogue of sub-criteria and,
                                       thereafter, a selection of those criteria considered as the most relevant. Methodologically,
                                       the “silent negotiation” could be applied in a moderated workshop, which helps to
                                       cope with power-imbalances in the consortium [<a href="#R24">24</a>]. If practitioners do not aim at running through a whole assessment process, the
                                       existing catalogue of criteria could also serve to structure focus group discussions
                                       or community assemblies. Moderated discussions between participants can help to enhance
                                       the joint understanding of arguments that underlie and explain differences in the
                                       quantitative assessments. For example, a group discussion after reading the descriptions
                                       can help to ease a common understanding about the information provided <i>before</i> scoring the alternatives. At the same time, such a discussion could help to alleviate
                                       the time budget of the facilitator for clarifying open questions from participants.
                                       With more time available, another option could be to firstly conduct scoring of alternatives
                                       without description, secondly with description prepared by the planner, and finally
                                       to compare and to discuss results together. Finally, and with respect to the alternatives,
                                       we recommend the inclusion of technologies that are most commonly applied so far to
                                       support a comparison of alternatives to the actual real-world situation.
